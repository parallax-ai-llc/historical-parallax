## Summary

The Kangxi Emperor (1654-1722), born Xuanye, was the fourth emperor of the Qing dynasty and the second Qing emperor to rule over China proper, reigning for 61 years from 1661 to 1722—the longest reign in Chinese history.[^1] Ascending to the throne at age seven following his father's death from smallpox, he assumed personal control at fifteen after orchestrating a dramatic coup against the powerful regent Oboi.[^2] His reign initiated the "High Qing" or "Prosperous Era of Kangxi and Qianlong," marked by territorial expansion, cultural flourishing, diplomatic innovation, and relative prosperity after decades of war and chaos.[^3] Considered one of China's greatest emperors, Kangxi successfully consolidated Manchu rule, suppressed major rebellions, expanded the empire's borders into Mongolia, Tibet, and Taiwan, and fostered unprecedented cultural and scholarly achievements including the compilation of the monumental Kangxi Dictionary.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Born on May 4, 1654, in Jingren Palace within the Forbidden City of Beijing, Xuanye was the third son of the Shunzhi Emperor and Empress Xiaokangzhang (also known as Empress Xiaokang), daughter of Tulai, a distinguished Qing general from the prestigious Tong clan.[^5] Despite being the third son, Xuanye was considered the crown prince because his mother held a higher rank than the mothers of his elder brothers.[^6] His ancestry reflected the multiethnic character of the Qing imperial family—he was less than half Manchu, with mixed Mongol, Chinese, and Manchu heritage.[^7]

As a young prince, Kangxi experienced little of the warmth and intimacy typical of family life. His father, the Shunzhi Emperor, took minimal interest in him, and his daily care was entrusted to wet nurses and palace eunuchs who attended him in nearly all activities.[^8] He rarely saw his parents and was raised primarily by his paternal grandmother, the formidable Grand Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, who would later prove instrumental in his rise to power.[^9] During his childhood, Kangxi enjoyed sports and hunting, physical activities that would serve him well as a military commander in later years.[^10]

A pivotal moment in young Xuanye's life came when he survived smallpox, one of the era's most feared diseases. This survival virtually ensured he would enjoy a long life and likely influenced his father's decision to designate him as heir apparent.[^11] His immunity to the disease that had killed his father became a crucial factor in the succession, as the Qing court sought to avoid another emperor falling victim to the epidemic.

In February 1661, when Xuanye was merely seven years old, his father died suddenly of smallpox at age twenty-three. The young prince was immediately crowned as the Kangxi Emperor, though actual governmental power remained in the hands of four regents appointed by the Shunzhi Emperor on his deathbed: Sonin, Suksaha, Ebilun, and Oboi.[^12] These four interior ministers were charged with assisting the child emperor and governing the empire during his minority.

Despite his youth and lack of formal authority, Kangxi received rigorous education throughout his early years. He retained a lifelong passion for learning, often reading until illness forced him to stop. He established a simple study area in the Forbidden City dedicated to his scholarly pursuits, focusing particularly on Zhu Xi's writings on Confucian teachings.[^13] The young emperor also demonstrated remarkable intellectual curiosity by engaging in conversations with Western Jesuit missionaries, studying subjects ranging from geometry to astronomy under tutors such as the Flemish Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest.[^14]

## Rise to Power

The regency period following the Shunzhi Emperor's death began with a cooperative arrangement among the four appointed regents, who initially governed together in accordance with the late emperor's dying wishes.[^15] However, this balance of power proved unstable. After Sonin's death in 1667, a fierce power struggle erupted. Oboi, the most ambitious and ruthless of the regents, moved decisively to consolidate absolute authority.[^16] He had his fellow regent Suksaha executed on fabricated charges and intimidated Ebilun into submission, effectively becoming a virtual dictator.[^17]

Although Kangxi formally began attending to affairs of state in 1667 at age thirteen, Oboi's growing influence made it nearly impossible for the young emperor to exercise genuine authority.[^18] Oboi monopolized power through intimidation and factional purges, creating what contemporaries described as a reign of terror within the court.[^19] The regent appointed his own supporters to key positions, overrode imperial decisions, and treated the teenage emperor with barely concealed contempt.

The situation reached a breaking point in 1669. With secret assistance from his grandmother, the Grand Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, the fifteen-year-old Kangxi devised a bold plan to eliminate Oboi and assume personal control of the government.[^20] In a brilliantly executed coup, Kangxi secretly trained a cadre of young wrestlers, disguising them as companions for innocent palace games. On the appointed day, as Oboi attended an imperial audience, these young wrestlers emerged from their hiding place behind the throne and overwhelmed the powerful minister.[^21]

The dramatic arrest shocked the court and demonstrated to officials and subjects alike that Kangxi was their true master.[^22] A subsequent investigation revealed thirty capital offenses committed by Oboi during his regency. However, in a gesture that revealed both his political acumen and sense of justice, Kangxi commuted the death sentence, acknowledging Oboi's past military contributions to the Qing dynasty.[^23] This act of measured clemency enhanced Kangxi's reputation for fairness and wisdom.

On May 14, 1669, the Kangxi Emperor finally took full control of the government at age fifteen.[^24] His decisive action against Oboi established him as a ruler of exceptional courage and strategic intelligence, qualities that would define his sixty-one-year reign. The young emperor immediately set about reforming the government, removing Oboi's corrupt appointees, and establishing his own authority over the vast Qing bureaucracy.

## Major Achievements

The Kangxi Emperor's reign witnessed extraordinary accomplishments across military, administrative, diplomatic, and cultural spheres, establishing him as one of the most effective rulers in Chinese history.

### Military Conquests and Territorial Expansion

Kangxi's most significant military achievement was suppressing the Revolt of the Three Feudatories (1673-1681), a massive rebellion that threatened to destroy the Qing dynasty.[^25] Three powerful Chinese generals—Wu Sangui, Geng Jimao, and Shang Kexi—had been granted extensive autonomous territories in southern China as rewards for helping the Manchus conquer China. By the 1670s, these feudatories had become semi-independent kingdoms, draining imperial coffers and threatening central authority.[^26]

Against the advice of most court officials, Kangxi attempted to force these feudal princes to relinquish their lands and retire to Manchuria. In December 1673, Wu Sangui responded by severing ties with the Qing and launching a rebellion under the banner "opposing Qing and restoring Ming."[^27] Wu even declared a new dynasty called Zhou in 1678. The eight-year war mobilized 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen on the Qing side.[^28] Kangxi's youthful energy and military genius ultimately prevailed. Wu Sangui died of illness in 1678, and his grandson Wu Shifan committed suicide in December 1681, ending the rebellion and consolidating Qing control over southern China.[^29]

Following this victory, Kangxi turned his attention to Taiwan, where the Zheng regime maintained Ming loyalist resistance. In 1683, Qing forces successfully invaded and forcefully integrated Taiwan into the empire.[^30] This conquest eliminated the last significant challenge to Qing legitimacy and brought the island under Chinese central government control for the first time.

Kangxi also achieved major diplomatic and military successes against Russia. The Treaty of Nerchinsk, signed on August 27, 1689, was China's first treaty with a European power and marked a revolutionary departure from traditional Chinese tributary diplomacy.[^31] The treaty established borders along the Gorbitsa and Stanovoy Range, granting China control over the Amur valley and Manchuria—approximately 600,000 square miles of territory.[^32] Significantly, the treaty treated both powers as equals; Kangxi was not referred to by his traditional title "Sovereign of the Whole World," and the language reflected mutual respect between two sovereign rulers.[^33] The treaty also opened Russian markets to Chinese goods and Chinese markets to Russian furs, establishing mutually beneficial trade relations.[^34]

Perhaps Kangxi's most personally demanding military campaigns involved the Dzungar Mongols of Central Asia. In 1688, the Dzungar leader Galdan invaded Khalkha Mongol territory, forcing nearly 20,000 refugees, including the Khalkha Buddhist spiritual leader Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, to flee south and seek Qing protection.[^35] At Dolon Nuur in 1691, Kangxi met with Khalkha tribal representatives who formally pledged allegiance to the Qing, effectively ending the last remnants of Mongol independence and allowing the Qing to claim the mantle of the Genghisid khans.[^36]

Determined to "exterminate" Galdan, Kangxi personally led military expeditions into Mongolia.[^37] In 1696, he organized a massive three-pronged campaign involving complex logistics, including 1,333 carts each carrying six shi of grain, and personally commanded 32,000 men with 235 cannon mounted on camels.[^38] At the Battle of Jao Modo in May 1696, Qing forces decisively defeated Galdan's army through superior musketry and artillery.[^39] Galdan fled to the Altai mountains with only 40-50 remaining guards and died of disease on April 4, 1697.[^40] This victory marked the first time the Qing successfully subdued frontier warfare and effectively incorporated Khalkha Mongolia under imperial rule.[^41]

### Cultural and Scholarly Achievements

Kangxi's patronage of scholarship and culture produced some of Chinese civilization's most enduring intellectual monuments. His court sponsored the compilation of the Kangxi Dictionary, completed in 1716, which catalogued over 47,000 Chinese characters organized into 214 radicals.[^42] This monumental work, commissioned to provide clarity for the emperor's multilingual subjects and establish authoritative meanings for Chinese characters, remained the standard reference for centuries.[^43]

Other major literary projects included the Complete Tang Poems poetry anthology and the Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China.[^44] Kangxi personally sponsored the writing of the Ming Official History, along with a phrase-dictionary, a vast encyclopedia, and an even more extensive compilation of Chinese literature.[^45] These projects employed hundreds of scholars and represented the emperor's commitment to preserving and systematizing Chinese cultural heritage.

To promote his image as a "sage ruler," Kangxi appointed both Manchu and Chinese tutors to study Confucian classics and practice Chinese calligraphy intensively.[^46] He became an accomplished calligrapher and poet himself, with many of his works preserved and admired to this day.[^47] By bringing scholars from the Yangzi River delta into his court and transforming Manchu rulership into a genuinely Confucian establishment based on Ming dynasty models, Kangxi won over the scholarly elite and the broader Chinese populace.[^48]

### Administrative Excellence and Governance

Kangxi demonstrated exceptional dedication to administrative duties. He read all reports and memoranda presented to him, meticulously correcting even minor scribal errors, and boasted of routinely processing all documents—sometimes 300-400 daily during wartime.[^49] He raised official salaries to diminish corruption and appointed educated Han Chinese to his court to discuss classical learning and calligraphy.[^50]

In 1669, Kangxi issued an imperial precept consisting of sixteen maxims (the Sacred Edict) detailing practical aspects of village life and offering moral guidelines to the Chinese peasantry. This edict was publicly read on the first and fifteenth day of every month in every village and town throughout the country for nearly two and a half centuries.[^51] His main policies focused on territorial expansion, continuing the Neo-Confucian bureaucratic system, and carefully managing relations with Europeans—trading with them and learning from their sciences while resisting their political expansion.[^52]

### Relations with Western Learning

Kangxi welcomed Jesuit missionaries to his court and utilized their expertise in various fields. After Ferdinand Verbiest proved European astronomy more accurate than Chinese astronomy in a 1669 public contest—correctly predicting shadow lengths, planetary positions, and a lunar eclipse—he was appointed Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory.[^53] Verbiest corrected the Chinese calendar, rebuilt the Beijing Ancient Observatory, and became a close friend of the emperor, teaching him geometry, philosophy, and music.[^54]

Kangxi gained extensive knowledge of astronomy and mathematics under Jesuit tutelage and consulted Verbiest on mechanics, hydraulics, ballistics, and kinetics.[^55] Verbiest even designed a steam-propelled trolley as a toy for the emperor around 1672, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle.[^56] The emperor opened four ports to foreign trade and encouraged the introduction of Western education, arts, and Roman Catholicism.[^57]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his many achievements, Kangxi's reign was marred by several significant controversies and failures that complicated his historical legacy.

### The Chinese Rites Controversy

Initially tolerant of Jesuit missionaries and Catholic proselytizing, Kangxi's relationship with the Catholic Church deteriorated dramatically due to the Chinese Rites Controversy.[^58] The dispute centered on whether Chinese converts could continue participating in traditional Confucian rituals honoring ancestors and Confucius himself. Jesuits in China argued these were civic rather than religious ceremonies and compatible with Christianity, but other Catholic orders disagreed.[^59]

When Pope Clement XI refused Jesuit attempts to accommodate Chinese cultural practices and issued decrees condemning the rites as incompatible with Christianity, Kangxi felt personally insulted and betrayed.[^60] By 1700, he had prohibited Christian missionaries from making further conversions, and eventually banned Catholic missionary activity entirely in China.[^61] This break with the Catholic Church proved disastrous for both sides: Christianity's growth in China was severely curtailed, and China lost access to valuable Western scientific knowledge. Historians suggest this controversy contributed to the Qing dynasty's increasing distrust of Westerners and inability to effectively deal with Western powers in subsequent centuries.[^62]

### The Succession Crisis

One of the most agonizing difficulties of Kangxi's final years was finding an appropriate successor.[^63] Until 1712, he favored his second son, Yinreng, born to his beloved first wife, Empress Xiaochengren, who died giving birth to him in 1674.[^64] Perhaps feeling guilty for his own lack of parental affection as a child, Kangxi personally oversaw Yinreng's upbringing, grooming him to be the perfect successor.[^65]

However, Yinreng's erratic and conspiratorial behavior made him an impossible choice. Years of being designated crown prince had corrupted his character, and he engaged in improper conduct and factional intrigue.[^66] Kangxi abolished the crown prince's status, reinstated it, then abolished it again, and ultimately imprisoned Yinreng until his death.[^67] The prolonged succession dispute embroiled Kangxi's later years and created fierce rivalries among his numerous sons—he had 24 sons and 12 daughters according to some accounts, with total children numbering as many as 56.[^68] The uncertainty and factional conflict surrounding succession poisoned the court atmosphere in Kangxi's final decade.

### Military Setbacks

Not all of Kangxi's military ventures succeeded. The main Eight Banners Army declined in effectiveness during his reign.[^69] In 1690, at the Battle of Ulaan Butun in Inner Mongolia, Qing forces were severely mauled by Galdan's Dzungar army despite vastly outnumbering the enemy.[^70] Although outnumbered five to one, the Dzungars formed a defensive camel wall, repulsed artillery-supported Qing assaults, and escaped into the hills, demonstrating weaknesses in Qing military capabilities.[^71]

### Controversial Policies

In spring 1662, Kangxi ordered the Great Clearance in southern China to combat the anti-Qing movement led by Ming loyalists under Zheng Chenggong.[^72] This policy forcibly relocated coastal populations inland to deny resources to Ming resistance forces, causing tremendous hardship and suffering for countless families.

His decision to challenge the Three Feudatories, though ultimately successful, went against the advice of most advisors and sparked an eight-year war that devastated southern China and cost hundreds of thousands of lives.[^73] For years afterward, Kangxi ruminated on his mistakes and blamed himself for the loss of life during the revolt.[^74]

Additionally, his invasion of Tibet was justified on grounds that Tibet was part of China, a claim that remains disputed by many historians and Tibetan advocates who argue Tibet maintained substantial autonomy before Qing intervention.[^75]

---

## Personal Life

Kangxi's personal life reflected both the privileges and constraints of imperial existence. He had three official wives and approximately sixty concubines, including four empresses, though all the empresses died young, leaving him without an empress from his mid-thirties onward.[^76] His first two wives were daughters of his former regents Sonin and Ebilun, while his third belonged to his grandfather's Tong clan—all politically strategic marriages.[^77]

His first spouse, Empress Xiaochengren, was apparently the love of his life. Her death in 1674 while giving birth to their son Yinreng devastated him emotionally.[^78] This personal tragedy influenced his decision to nominate Yinreng as crown prince and carefully educate him—a decision that would ultimately bring heartbreak when Yinreng proved unworthy and had to be imprisoned.[^79]

Perhaps because he felt deprived of parental affection during his own childhood, Kangxi tried to love and care for his children.[^80] However, with 35 sons according to some sources (other sources claim 56 total children), maintaining close relationships proved impossible.[^81] While he left most sons' education to others, his intense personal involvement in Yinreng's upbringing—and the tragic outcome—demonstrated both his capacity for paternal devotion and the dangers of favoritism in succession matters.[^82]

Kangxi's personality combined seemingly contradictory qualities. As a ruler, he displayed frugality, keeping only a small number of court attendants and never increasing taxes even during wartime—indeed, he decreased or exempted taxes on several occasions.[^83] Yet he also possessed formidable physical prowess and military skill. According to the historian Finer, Kangxi's written reflections reveal "how intimate and caring was his communion with the rank-and-file" soldiers during the Dzungar campaign, the only military operation in which he actively participated as field commander.[^84]

His intellectual curiosity remained insatiable throughout life. An accomplished calligrapher and poet, he was also deeply interested in Western learning, particularly astronomy and mathematics.[^85] He enjoyed sports and hunting, activities begun in childhood that he maintained into adulthood.[^86] This combination of scholarly refinement and martial vigor embodied the Confucian ideal of the complete man—both cultivated and courageous.

Kangxi was also capable of profound self-reflection and admitted his errors. His tendency to ruminate on mistakes, particularly regarding the loss of life during the Three Feudatories revolt, revealed a conscience unusual among absolute monarchs.[^87] In his famous 1717 valedictory edict, he wrote: "I have worked with unceasing diligence and intense watchfulness, never resting, never idle. So for decades I have exhausted all my strength, day after day."[^88]

## Legacy

The Kangxi Emperor's legacy profoundly shaped the trajectory of Chinese history and created much of the political, economic, and cultural inheritance of modern China.

### Historical Significance

Kangxi is universally regarded as one of China's greatest emperors.[^89] His 61-year reign remains the longest in Chinese history and ranks among the longest of any monarch worldwide.[^90] His rule brought long-term stability and relative prosperity after decades of war and chaos, initiating the "High Qing era" or "Prosperous Era of Kangxi and Qianlong," which spanned his reign, his son Yongzheng's, and his grandson Qianlong's reigns.[^91] These three generations established the course of Qing history and created the foundation for China's territorial extent and administrative structures.[^92]

### Territorial and Political Legacy

Kangxi's military conquests permanently expanded China's borders, adding areas north of the Amur River, portions of Outer Mongolia, Tibet, and Taiwan to the empire.[^93] His suppression of the Three Feudatories revolt, conquest of Taiwan, subordination of Mongolia, and incorporation of Tibet created the territorial framework of modern China.[^94] The Treaty of Nerchinsk established peaceful borders with Russia that lasted over a century and demonstrated that China could negotiate with foreign powers on equal terms when circumstances required.[^95]

Politically, Kangxi successfully transformed Manchu rulership into a genuinely Confucian establishment by winning over the scholarly elite and broader Chinese populace.[^96] His dedication to Confucian values, patronage of Chinese culture, and appointment of Han Chinese to high positions legitimized Qing rule and promoted national unity despite the dynasty's foreign origins.[^97] This political integration proved crucial to the Qing dynasty's longevity and China's cohesion.

### Cultural and Intellectual Legacy

Kangxi's cultural patronage created enduring monuments to Chinese civilization. The Kangxi Dictionary remained the standard reference for Chinese characters for centuries.[^98] His sponsorship of the Ming Official History, Complete Tang Poems, Complete Classics Collection, encyclopedias, and literary compilations preserved and systematized Chinese cultural heritage for future generations.[^99] His Sacred Edict provided moral guidance to Chinese peasants for nearly 250 years, shaping social values and community life across the empire.[^100]

By promoting himself as a "sage ruler" who studied Confucian classics, practiced calligraphy, and demonstrated cultural refinement, Kangxi established a model of enlightened imperial rulership that subsequent emperors sought to emulate.[^101] His engagement with both Chinese and Western learning demonstrated intellectual openness and curiosity that characterized the High Qing period's cosmopolitan culture.[^102]

### Relations with the West

Kangxi's initial openness to Jesuit missionaries and Western learning introduced valuable scientific knowledge to China, including advances in astronomy, mathematics, cartography, and technology.[^103] Although the Chinese Rites Controversy eventually soured relations, the period of fruitful exchange during Kangxi's prime demonstrated the potential for mutually beneficial Sino-Western interaction.[^104]

However, his eventual ban on Catholic missionary activity and the resulting increase in distrust of Westerners may have contributed to China's difficulties dealing with Western powers in later centuries, when technological and diplomatic flexibility became crucial.[^105] This aspect of his legacy remains contested among historians.

### Overall Assessment

Kangxi devoted his reign to consolidating Manchu power, promoting national unity, and showing respect for traditional Chinese culture.[^106] His efforts made him one of the most lauded and respected emperors in Chinese history.[^107] Together with his grandson Qianlong, Kangxi set the course of Qing history and created much of the political, economic, and cultural legacy inherited by modern China.[^108] His reign demonstrated that effective governance required both military strength and cultural legitimacy, both administrative excellence and moral authority—lessons that continue to resonate in contemporary discussions of Chinese statecraft and leadership.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Among Chinese autocrats, the Kangxi Emperor has secured perhaps the best reputation among scholars and historians.[^109] His reign was long, and while not perfectly peaceful, his rule was widely accepted as legitimate and even sagely.[^110] Historians have praised his exceptional intellectual achievements, noting that Chinese sources describe him as an active and demanding student who engaged deeply with both Chinese and Western learning, devoting himself to astronomy, mathematics, and natural philosophy.[^111]

His political acumen in winning over the Confucian intelligentsia deserves particular recognition. Despite deep reservations about Manchu rule and loyalty to the fallen Ming dynasty, Kangxi managed to woo the scholarly class into cooperating with the Qing government.[^112] As one historian noted, "The man most responsible for accomplishing the task of enlisting the help of the Chinese populace—in particular the elite scholarly class—was the Kangxi Emperor."[^113] This achievement proved crucial to the Qing dynasty's stability and longevity.

Kangxi's cultural patronage has earned consistent praise. By personally sponsoring the Ming Official History, Kangxi Dictionary, encyclopedias, and literary compilations, he demonstrated commitment to preserving Chinese cultural heritage that transcended ethnic divisions between Manchus and Han Chinese.[^114] His dedication to Confucian learning, mastery of Chinese calligraphy, and promotion of Chinese cultural values legitimized Qing rule in ways military conquest alone could never achieve.[^115]

His military leadership has also been lauded. According to historian S. E. Finer, Kangxi's written reflections from the Dzungar campaign reveal "how intimate and caring was his communion with the rank-and-file" soldiers, demonstrating a leader who understood and valued those who served him.[^116] His personal courage in leading military expeditions into Mongolia at age 42, his strategic wisdom in suppressing the Three Feudatories revolt, and his diplomatic skill in negotiating the Treaty of Nerchinsk all demonstrate exceptional leadership capabilities.[^117]

Kangxi's administrative excellence set standards for imperial governance. His meticulous attention to documents, practice of correcting even minor errors, dedication to reducing corruption through higher official salaries, and refusal to increase taxes even during wartime demonstrated both competence and benevolence rare among absolute monarchs.[^118] His capacity for self-reflection and willingness to acknowledge mistakes further distinguished him from typical autocrats.[^119]

### Negative Views

Modern scholarship has developed more critical and nuanced assessments of Kangxi's reign, challenging traditional hagiographic narratives. Some Chinese scholars have questioned the conventional portrayal of the Kangxi-Qianlong era as an unqualified golden age. Yang Nianqun of Renmin University's Qing History Institute argued: "The damage to cultural character caused by prosperous age unification is extremely severe, and the room for free expression is extremely small."[^120] This perspective emphasizes how political consolidation and censorship during the High Qing period stifled intellectual creativity and independent thought.

Critics point to several policy failures and moral failures during Kangxi's reign. The Chinese Rites Controversy, while not entirely Kangxi's fault, resulted in disastrous long-term consequences for both Christianity in China and China's relationship with Western learning.[^121] His inflexibility once he felt personally insulted by papal authority demonstrated how personal pride could override strategic considerations.

The succession crisis that dominated Kangxi's final years revealed serious failures in judgment and family management. His obsessive favoritism toward Yinreng, despite mounting evidence of the crown prince's unsuitability, created court factionalism and ultimately required imprisoning his own son.[^122] The prolonged uncertainty and rivalry among his numerous sons poisoned court politics and created instability that his successor, the Yongzheng Emperor, had to navigate carefully.[^123]

Some historians question Kangxi's military reputation. The Battle of Ulaan Butun demonstrated significant weaknesses in the Eight Banners Army, which suffered severe losses despite overwhelming numerical superiority.[^124] The decline of the banner system during Kangxi's reign would create military vulnerabilities that later emperors struggled to address.

His territorial conquests, while expanding Chinese power, are viewed more critically by modern scholars sensitive to issues of imperialism and ethnic self-determination. The invasion of Tibet and incorporation of Mongolia involved military coercion and the suppression of local autonomy, raising questions about the legitimacy of these actions.[^125] The Great Clearance of 1662 in southern China caused immense suffering for coastal populations forcibly relocated inland.[^126]

Recent China-centric scholarship has also challenged earlier Western interpretations that portrayed Kangxi primarily through a European lens. Modern scholars "tend to recognize more agency within China itself, which allows for more China-centric historical narratives to unfold," moving beyond simplistic narratives of East-West encounter toward more complex understandings of Qing dynasty governance and culture.[^127]
