## Summary

In January 2022, Kazakhstan—long considered Central Asia's most stable autocracy—exploded. What began as protests against fuel price hikes in a remote oil town became the worst unrest since independence. Within days, Almaty, the largest city, was burning. Protesters stormed government buildings. President Tokayev issued a "shoot to kill without warning" order and called in Russian troops. At least 238 people died—mostly protesters, some shot in the head.[^1]

The "January Events," as Kazakhs now call them, revealed the brittleness beneath three decades of apparent stability. The long shadow of former President Nursultan Nazarbayev—who had ruled since Soviet times—had created resentment that fuel prices alone cannot explain. When the bullets stopped, Tokayev had consolidated power, purged Nazarbayev's allies, and demonstrated that Kazakhstan's rulers would kill to survive.[^2]

The events also showed something else: when Central Asian regimes call for help, Russia answers. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) deployed troops within days—the first time the alliance had been activated. The message to the region was clear: Moscow would not allow another color revolution on its borders. For Kazakhstan, the January Events ended in blood, a power transition, and uncomfortable questions that remain unanswered.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Nazarbayev's Kazakhstan

**Nursultan Nazarbayev:**

- Communist Party boss since 1989
- President 1991-2019 (28 years)
- "Father of the Nation" (_Elbasy_)
- Capital renamed Nur-Sultan (until 2022)

**The system:**

- One-man authoritarian rule
- Oil/gas wealth
- Relative prosperity
- Controlled politics but allowed some freedoms

**March 2019:**

- Nazarbayev resigned suddenly
- Handed power to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev
- But retained key positions:
  - Chair of Security Council
  - "Leader of the Nation" title
  - Family controls much of economy[^4]

### The Dual Power Problem

**By 2022:**

- Tokayev formally president
- But Nazarbayev's network ("the Family") still powerful
- Nazarbayev's nephews, allies in key positions
- Who really ruled was unclear

**Corruption and inequality:**

- Oil wealth concentrated at top
- Many Kazakhs struggled
- Western regions especially resentful

## The Protests

### The Spark: LPG Prices (January 2-4)

- Site of 2011 massacre of oil workers
- Symbolic location

**January 3-4:**

- Protests spread to other western cities
- Then nationwide
- **Almaty** saw major demonstrations[^5]

### Escalation (January 4-5)

**Demands expanded:**

- Then: Political reform
- "Old man, go away!" (_Shal, ket!_) - referring to Nazarbayev

- Too late—protests continued

**January 5:**

## Historical Assessment

### What Really Happened?

**Still disputed:**

- Were there organized "terrorists"?
- Was it a power struggle at the top?
- Did Nazarbayev allies provoke violence to discredit Tokayev?
- Or genuine popular uprising exploited by various actors?

**Most likely:** Combination

- Genuine protest movement
- Some criminal elements
- Possibly elite manipulation
- Security forces panicked and killed

### Tokayev's Calculation

**Tokayev's options were:**

1. Lose power (to streets or Nazarbayev network)
2. Kill enough to restore control

**He chose violence** and emerged stronger.

### Russian Role

**Putin's message:**

- CSTO works
- Color revolutions will be crushed
- Central Asia is Russian sphere

**But also:**

- Kazakhstan has to balance Russia
- Too dependent = vulnerability
- Tokayev seeks diversification[^11]

## Legacy

### For Kazakhstan

- January 2022 = national trauma
- "Bloody January" (_Қandy Қańtar_)
- Tokayev era firmly established
- But reforms limited
- Trust destroyed

### For Central Asia

- Regimes take note: Russia will help
- But also: Protests can happen anywhere
- Stability not guaranteed

### The Unanswered Questions

- Full truth about deaths?
- Who organized violence?
- What happened in those dark nights?

**Kazakhs are waiting for answers that may never come.**[^12]
