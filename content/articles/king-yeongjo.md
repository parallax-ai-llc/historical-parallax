## Summary

King Yeongjo (1694-1776), personal name Yi Geum, was the 21st monarch of Korea's Joseon Dynasty, reigning for 52 years from 1724 to 1776—the longest reign in the dynasty's 500-year history.[^1] Born as the second son of King Sukjong by his concubine Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Haeju Choe clan, Yeongjo overcame the stigma of his low-born origins to become one of Joseon's most celebrated reformers.[^2] He is best remembered for his Tangpyeongchaek (Policy of Magnificent Harmony), which sought to reconcile bitter factional divisions, and for his comprehensive taxation and legal reforms that modernized Joseon's administrative system.[^3] His reign was marked by economic prosperity and cultural renaissance, though it was forever shadowed by the controversial execution of his son, Crown Prince Sado, in 1762.[^4] American missionary Homer Hulbert described Yeongjo's reign as "one of the most brilliant" in Joseon's history.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Yi Geum was born on October 31, 1694, as the second son of King Sukjong.[^6] His mother, Lady Choi (Sukbin Choi, 1670-1718), belonged to the Cheonmin—the lowest social class during the Joseon period—and entered the palace at age seven as a musuri (water maid).[^7] This low-born origin would cast a long shadow over Yi Geum's early life and political career, subjecting him to persistent discrimination from yangban aristocrats who viewed him with contempt despite his royal blood.[^8]

Despite these challenges, the young prince was raised in a relatively nurturing environment. King Sukjong was a doting father who spent lavishly on Yi Geum, though court officials frequently lectured the king on frugality and modesty, implicitly criticizing his affection for the son of a lowly concubine.[^9] Yi Geum proved to be a child prodigy, demonstrating exceptional intelligence and scholarly aptitude from an early age.[^10] In 1703, when Yi Geum was nine years old, Queen Inwon adopted him as her own son—a significant political move that elevated his status within the palace hierarchy.[^11] Queen Inwon regarded him as her favorite and treated him with genuine maternal affection.

The prince received a rigorous Confucian education befitting a potential heir to the throne. He immersed himself in the classics and Confucian philosophy with such dedication that he would later be recognized as possessing greater knowledge of the Confucian canon than his own court officials.[^12] This intellectual foundation shaped his worldview profoundly, instilling in him the belief that virtuous governance according to Confucian principles was the highest duty of a monarch.

Yi Geum's position became increasingly precarious as factional politics intensified. The Noron and Soron factions—two dominant political groups—viewed him through opposing lenses. While some saw him as a legitimate heir despite his maternal lineage, others, particularly the Soron faction, regarded his very existence as a threat to their political interests.[^13] These early experiences of political intrigue and personal discrimination forged in Yi Geum a deep understanding of the destructive nature of factionalism, a lesson that would profoundly influence his later policies as king.

## Rise to Power

The path to the throne was neither smooth nor certain for Prince Yeoning (Yi Geum's princely title). In 1720, his elder half-brother ascended the throne as King Gyeongjong, the 20th ruler of Joseon.[^14] Within months of Gyeongjong's accession, a momentous decision was made: Prince Yeoning was designated as crown prince, inducing intense controversy between the Noron and Soron political factions.[^15]

According to some accounts, King Sukjong had supposedly told Yi I-myeong before his death to name Prince Yeoning as Gyeongjong's heir, but no official record exists of this directive since it was allegedly made without a historiographer or scribe present.[^16] This absence of documentation would later fuel conspiracy theories and political accusations. The Noron faction, seeing Yeoning as their preferred candidate, unsuccessfully attempted to pressure the newly crowned Gyeongjong to step down in favor of his younger half-brother—a move that created deep resentment among the Soron faction who supported Gyeongjong.[^17]

When King Gyeongjong died suddenly in 1724 after a reign of just four years, the circumstances of his death immediately became the subject of intense speculation and accusation.[^18] The Soron faction accused Prince Yeoning of complicity in his brother's death, citing the earlier attempt by Noron supporters to replace Gyeongjong with Yeoning as evidence of a conspiracy.[^19] Many historians now believe that Gyeongjong likely died from food poisoning caused by contaminated seafood, as he displayed symptoms consistent with such an illness.[^20] Nevertheless, the cloud of suspicion would persist.

On October 16, 1724, Prince Yeoning ascended the throne as King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of Joseon, at age 30.[^21] His accession was immediately challenged by those who questioned his legitimacy. The opposition reached its climax in 1728 with the Yi In-jwa Rebellion, an armed insurrection led by radical members of the Soron faction.[^22] The rebels justified their uprising by raising suspicions about King Gyeongjong's death and claiming that Yeongjo was not the legitimate heir of King Sukjong.[^23] The rebellion began on March 15, 1728, when Yi In-jwa captured Cheongju Castle, and rebel forces marched toward the capital Hanyang (present-day Seoul).[^24] A serious famine had helped anger the populace enough to support the rebellion.[^25]

However, the royal army, aided by loyal officials including Park Mun-su, decisively defeated the rebels.[^26] The suppression of the rebellion marked a turning point in Yeongjo's reign, as it demonstrated both his political resilience and the limits of factional opposition. Ironically, while scholar-officials took the lead in pacifying the rebellion, the fact that most instigators were themselves scholars weakened their collective political position in the subsequent political landscape.[^27]

## Major Achievements

### The Tangpyeongchaek: Policy of Magnificent Harmony

King Yeongjo's most celebrated achievement was his Tangpyeongchaek (탕평책; 蕩平策), or "Policy of Magnificent Harmony," which sought to end the destructive factional strife that had plagued Joseon politics for generations.[^28] Realizing the detrimental effects that bitter rivalries between the Noron and Soron factions had on state administration, Yeongjo attempted to end factionalism as soon as he ascended the throne.[^29]

The Tangpyeong policy sought to balance rival groups, preventing the bloody purges that had characterized previous reigns.[^30] Yeongjo pursued a policy of equal recruitment, organizing a new coalition government consisting of officials from various factional backgrounds based on merit and loyalty rather than factional affiliation.[^31] He described this approach as "politics based on impartial public appointment."[^32] While he hesitated to purge the Soron faction outright despite their rebellion, he banished extremist Junso leaders to remote posts while restoring honor to some Noron martyrs who had been victims of earlier purges.[^33]

This policy of impartiality and balance represented a philosophical commitment to Confucian ideals of virtuous governance transcending narrow political interests. Though factional politics never entirely disappeared during Yeongjo's reign, the Tangpyeongchaek succeeded in reducing their intensity and preventing the wholesale political massacres that had occurred in earlier periods.

### Taxation and Economic Reforms

Yeongjo implemented comprehensive reforms to Joseon's taxation system, addressing inequities that had long burdened the common people.[^34] His most significant reform concerned the military service tax (gunpo), which had placed an onerous burden on commoners while exempting the yangban aristocracy. Yeongjo reinstated universal military service tax but then reduced it by half, compensating for the revenue shortfall through taxes on fisheries, salt, vessels, and an additional land tax.[^35]

This reform, known as the Gyunyeokbeop (均役法), redistributed the tax burden more equitably across social classes.[^36] Yeongjo also instituted an accounting system to rationalize state revenues and expenses, bringing greater transparency and efficiency to government finances.[^37] He adopted practical measures such as allowing remote Gyeongsang Province to pay taxes in grain at nearby ports rather than transporting them to the capital, and permitting mountainous areas to pay in cotton or cash instead of grain.[^38]

These reforms demonstrated Yeongjo's understanding that effective governance required adapting administrative systems to geographic and economic realities rather than rigidly applying uniform policies.

### Legal Code Compilation

Yeongjo undertook a monumental project to modernize Joseon's legal framework by compiling the Sok-Daejeon (續大典), which merged all existing legal codes into a unified system.[^39] This compilation proceeded in three stages: first, the king's Sugyo (royal orders) were compiled as Shinbo Sugyo Jibrok; second, these were integrated into the existing legal code system as Jeungbo Jeonrok Tonggo; and third, all codes were merged under the name Sok-Daejeon.[^40]

This effort was born from recognition that the Gyeongguk Daejeon—the legal code established early in the Joseon dynasty—could no longer adequately reflect centuries of social, economic, and political changes.[^41] By systematizing and updating the legal framework, Yeongjo provided a more coherent and relevant foundation for governance that would serve Joseon for decades to come.

### Social and Infrastructure Reforms

Yeongjo made concerted efforts to improve the lives of peasants through education and practical assistance.[^42] He distributed important agricultural texts in Korean script (Hangeul), making technical knowledge accessible to farmers who could not read classical Chinese.[^43] He increased opportunities for upward social mobility for the children of commoners, challenging the rigid hereditary class system that had long characterized Joseon society.[^44]

One of Yeongjo's most visible accomplishments was the Cheonggyecheon dredging project in the capital.[^45] The riverbed was excavated to create a deeper waterway, improving water flow and preventing the devastating floods that had repeatedly plagued the city. This massive public works project demonstrated the king's commitment to practical improvements in urban infrastructure and public welfare.

Yeongjo also instituted humanitarian reforms in the judicial system. He banned certain punitive measures of torture and violence that had been standard practice under ancient penal codes—a progressive stance that remained a source of wonder among historians, particularly for such an authority-oriented leader.[^46] His compassion extended even to animals; when his physician suggested using cat skin for medicine, Yeongjo refused, asserting he was "simply unable to bear the thought of living creatures being skinned" for his recovery.[^47]

### Cultural and Scholarly Achievements

During the reigns of Yeongjo and his grandson Jeongjo, Joseon experienced a cultural renaissance.[^48] Confucianization reached its height, as did economic recovery from the devastating wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.[^49] Yeongjo himself was a prolific writer and scholar; the Jangseogak Archives hold 5,000 pieces of his literary works (eoje), with each being a sole manuscript written by hand, consisting primarily of poems.[^50]

Between 2005 and 2014, the Academy of Korean Studies undertook an annotation project involving nine researchers and 15 assistants to compile and analyze Yeongjo's writings, publishing the results in ten volumes of Annotated Yeongjo Eoje.[^51] These works are unique in that Yeongjo did not follow fixed literary formats of his time, instead freely expressing his candid feelings and emotions, revealing his introspection and reminiscences.[^52]

Yeongjo also compiled a book of passages from the classics and exemplary political ideals from wise kings, which he published to discipline himself and provide guidance to the crown prince.[^53] The value of this compilation is considered equivalent to the Hongjaejeonseo (Complete Works of King Jeongjo).[^54] Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo ruled as "sovereign-teachers," authoring many publications and advancing education and literacy.[^55]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Crown Prince Sado Tragedy

The defining controversy of King Yeongjo's reign—and arguably of his entire legacy—was the execution of his only surviving son, Crown Prince Sado, in 1762.[^56] This shocking event has been debated by historians and dramatized in popular culture for centuries, with competing interpretations of what caused the tragedy and whether it was justified.

Crown Prince Sado (born Yi Sun) was born on September 13, 1735, to Yeongjo's consort Royal Noble Consort Yeongbin Yi.[^57] After the death of Crown Prince Hyojang in 1728, Sado filled the critical role of heir and was formally installed as crown prince in 1749.[^58] However, the relationship between father and son was fraught with tension from early on.

According to historical records, particularly the Hanjoong-Rok (한중록) written by Crown Prince Sado's widow, Lady Hong, Sado suffered from severe mental illness.[^59] The crown prince reportedly exhibited erratic and violent behavior, randomly killing people in the palace and raping palace maids.[^60] Modern psychiatric analysis of his symptoms suggests he may have suffered from bipolar disorder.[^61] Sado experienced a severe illness in 1745 during which he often lost consciousness, and although he recovered physically, the tense relationship with his father led to severe anxiety whenever he was in Yeongjo's presence.[^62]

The situation deteriorated markedly in 1757 when both Queen Inwon (Yeongjo's adoptive mother) and Queen Jeongseong (his first wife) died within a month of each other.[^63] Sado had been close to both women, and their deaths led to a marked worsening of his mental health and relationship with his father.

On a hot July day in 1762, King Yeongjo ordered Crown Prince Sado to climb into a wooden rice chest (dwikkwijeu).[^64] Because Yeongjo could not execute his son directly without also implicating his daughter-in-law and grandson (the future King Jeongjo), this method allowed the king to technically avoid ordering an execution.[^65] Sado responded from inside the chest until the night of the seventh day; the chest was opened on the eighth day and he was pronounced dead.[^66]

### Competing Interpretations

Historians have debated for centuries what truly caused this shocking event:[^67]

**Mental Illness Theory**: Historical records indicate Sado suffered from mental illness with violent symptoms. Modern scholars who find the Hanjoong-Rok credible believe his death was a tragic but necessary response to genuine danger he posed to the palace and the stability of the royal succession.[^68]

**Political Conspiracy Theory**: Some historians have questioned the credibility of the Hanjoong-Rok, arguing that Crown Prince Sado was sacrificed in political confrontation between the Noron and Soron factions.[^69] This theory suggests powerful factions manipulated Yeongjo into eliminating his son.

**Recent Scholarly Consensus**: While the political conspiracy theory once prevailed, recent scholarly opinion increasingly accepts that Sado's symptoms of mental illness as described in the Hanjoong-Rok are credible.[^70] According to contemporary historians, there is no conclusive evidence that Sado was the victim of a political conspiracy.[^71]

**Popular Culture Interpretation**: In contrast to historical data suggesting Sado was mentally ill and violent, popular culture has often presented him sympathetically as a victim of political power struggles and paternal cruelty.[^72]

The fundamental questions remain troubling: Was the prince's unpredictable behavior genuinely a menace to the country? Why did Yeongjo feel compelled to kill his son instead of exiling him?[^73] These questions continue to generate debate and reinterpretation.

### Legitimacy Challenges and Political Repression

Throughout his reign, particularly in the early years, Yeongjo faced persistent challenges to his legitimacy stemming from his mother's low-born status and the suspicious circumstances of King Gyeongjong's death.[^74] The Soron faction's accusations that he was complicit in his brother's death, though likely unfounded, created a political atmosphere of suspicion and resentment.

While Yeongjo's Tangpyeong policy sought balance and impartiality, his response to the 1728 Yi In-jwa Rebellion involved executing the rebel leaders and their families, and banishing extremist Soron leaders to remote posts.[^75] Critics might argue that his proclaimed policy of reconciliation had limits when faced with direct challenges to his authority.

### Age-Disparate Marriage

In 1759, following the death of Queen Jeongseong in 1757, the 64-year-old King Yeongjo married 13-year-old Kim from the Gyeongju Kim clan, who became Queen Jeongsun.[^76] This marriage, formalized on June 22, 1759, at Changgyeonggung, was considered the oldest (in terms of groom's age) and most age-disparate marriage in Joseon dynasty history.[^77] While such age differences were not uncommon for royal marriages of the era, modern sensibilities view this union critically. Yeongjo could not elevate one of his existing concubines to queenship because his father King Sukjong had banned former concubines from becoming queen.[^78]

---

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Family

King Yeongjo was married twice. His first wife, Queen Jeongseong of the Daegu Seo clan, married him in November 1703 when she was ten years old and he was eight.[^79] Her father, Seo Jong-jae (1656-1719), was a civil servant from the Daegu Seo clan who held various administrative positions and was posthumously honored with the title Internal Prince Dalseong.[^80] Queen Jeongseong had no biological children but served as adoptive mother to Crown Prince Sado.[^81] She died in 1757, causing great distress to Crown Prince Sado, who had been close to her.[^82]

Following Queen Jeongseong's death, Yeongjo held bridal selections and married Queen Jeongsun of the Gyeongju Kim clan in 1759.[^83] Neither of his queens produced biological heirs.

Yeongjo had several royal concubines. Royal Noble Consort Yeongbin Yi of the Jeonui Yi clan (1696-1764) was the mother of Crown Prince Sado.[^84] The records indicate Yeongjo did not produce a legitimate heir through his two consorts but was fortunate to have Crown Prince Sado through his concubine.[^85]

After Crown Prince Sado's death in 1762, succession passed to Sado's son, who would become King Jeongjo, one of Joseon's most celebrated monarchs.[^86] The tragedy of Sado's death thus created a complex family legacy, with Yeongjo's grandson eventually vindicating his father's memory while continuing his grandfather's reformist policies.

### Personality and Character

Contemporary accounts describe Yeongjo as articulate, bright, benevolent, and kind—a monarch who was penetrating in observation and quick of comprehension.[^87] His deep Confucian learning was legendary; he possessed greater knowledge of the classics than his own officials.[^88] This intellectual superiority allowed him to engage in sophisticated philosophical debates and to craft policies grounded in Confucian ethical principles.

Yeongjo demonstrated remarkable compassion, particularly toward his subjects and even toward animals.[^89] He deeply worried for his people, ordering his courtiers to reduce taxes and decrease the number of dishes in his own meals when he feared that rain would ruin harvests and cause starvation among his subjects.[^90]

Yet Yeongjo's personality also contained contradictions. The same king who showed compassion to animals and reduced his own meals to share his people's suffering also ordered his own son confined in a rice chest to die of suffocation and starvation. This paradox has fascinated historians and dramatists alike, suggesting a complex psychological profile shaped by the intense pressures of absolute monarchy, Confucian duty, and personal trauma.

### Lifestyle and Longevity

King Yeongjo's lifestyle was remarkably austere for a monarch. Despite having access to all manner of delicacies, he ate like a vegetarian, though nutritional needs induced him to occasionally consume poultry (such as pheasant or quail) and fish (such as croaker), making him more accurately a flexitarian.[^91] The rice he enjoyed was grain rice mixed with brown rice and soybeans, accompanied by very simple side dishes; compared to other Joseon kings' diets, his contained fewer meats and a higher ratio of plant-based foods.[^92]

While other kings typically consumed five meals per day, Yeongjo ate only three, each of such small portion that palace cooks worried about his health.[^93] The secret to his longevity is said to be this frugal diet, focusing on low-carbohydrate, low-fat, and vegetarian food.[^94]

This lifestyle contributed to Yeongjo living to age 83 (by Korean reckoning) or 81 (by Western calculation), making him the longest-lived king of the Joseon Dynasty.[^95] His 52-year reign was also the longest in Joseon history.[^96] His combination of intellectual rigor, physical discipline, and moderate lifestyle created the conditions for both longevity and sustained governance effectiveness.

## Legacy

King Yeongjo's legacy is fundamentally dual in nature: he is remembered both as one of Joseon's greatest reformist monarchs and as the king who killed his own son in one of Korean history's most shocking episodes.

### Political and Administrative Legacy

Yeongjo's Tangpyeongchaek fundamentally changed the character of Joseon factional politics.[^97] While factionalism never entirely disappeared, his policy of impartial appointment and balance prevented the wholesale massacres that had characterized earlier periods. This created political stability that allowed for the cultural and economic renaissance of the late 18th century.[^98] His grandson Jeongjo continued and expanded the Tangpyeong policy, cementing it as a governing principle for the dynasty's final flourishing.

Yeongjo's taxation reforms, particularly the Gyunyeokbeop military tax reform, addressed fundamental inequities in Joseon's fiscal system.[^99] By redistributing tax burdens more equitably and modernizing revenue collection, he strengthened the state's financial foundation while easing the burdens on common people. These reforms contributed to economic recovery and growth during his reign.

The Sok-Daejeon legal code compilation provided a modernized and systematized legal framework that would serve Joseon governance for generations.[^100] This achievement demonstrated Yeongjo's understanding that effective administration required institutional frameworks that evolved with changing social realities.

### Cultural and Intellectual Legacy

The reigns of Yeongjo and Jeongjo are regarded as representing a cultural renaissance in Joseon history.[^101] Confucianization reached its apex, intellectual life flourished, and economic prosperity returned after the devastations of earlier wars.[^102] Yeongjo's own voluminous writings—5,000 pieces preserved in the Jangseogak Archives—provide invaluable insights into the intellectual and emotional life of an 18th-century Korean monarch.[^103]

His promotion of education and distribution of Korean-language agricultural texts contributed to increased literacy and practical knowledge among commoners.[^104] The model of the "sovereign-teacher" that Yeongjo exemplified, continued by Jeongjo, elevated the intellectual and moral expectations for Korean kingship.[^105]

### The Shadow of Crown Prince Sado

Despite his many achievements, Yeongjo's legacy cannot be separated from the Crown Prince Sado tragedy.[^106] This event has been continuously reinterpreted across centuries, serving as a lens through which Koreans have examined questions of filial piety, political authority, mental illness, and the human costs of absolute monarchy.

Recent historical interpretations have increasingly accepted that although kings are fundamentally political beings, personal characteristics and family history have considerable influence on political behavior.[^107] Yeongjo's relationship with Sado reflects the complex interplay of personal psychology, Confucian ideology, political pressure, and the impossible burdens placed on individuals by the institution of absolute monarchy.

### Overall Historical Assessment

King Yeongjo gains evaluation as a great king who led the revival of the late Joseon era.[^108] American missionary Homer Hulbert's assessment of Yeongjo's reign as "one of the most brilliant" in Joseon's history reflects a scholarly consensus that, despite the Sado tragedy, Yeongjo's reforms and governance significantly benefited the Korean people and state.[^109]

In spite of the controversy surrounding Crown Prince Sado's death, Yeongjo has earned a positive reputation in Korean history due to his sincere efforts to rule by Confucian virtue and his substantive reforms that addressed real problems in Joseon society.[^110] His legacy demonstrates how historical figures can be simultaneously admirable for their public achievements and deeply flawed in their personal actions—a complexity that makes them enduringly fascinating subjects of historical inquiry.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians have consistently praised King Yeongjo for his reformist zeal and effective governance. His Tangpyeongchaek is regarded as one of the most sophisticated political strategies in Joseon history, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of how to manage factional conflict without resorting to wholesale purges.[^111] Political historians note that by organizing a coalition government based on impartial public appointment rather than factional loyalty, Yeongjo created unprecedented political stability.[^112]

Economic historians emphasize the significance of his taxation reforms, particularly the Gyunyeokbeop, which redistributed tax burdens more equitably and rationalized revenue collection.[^113] These reforms not only improved state finances but also alleviated suffering among commoners, demonstrating governance that balanced fiscal necessity with social justice.[^114]

Confucian scholars have long admired Yeongjo's deep learning and his commitment to ruling according to Confucian principles.[^115] His knowledge of the classics reportedly exceeded that of his officials, allowing him to engage in sophisticated ideological discourse and to ground his policies in philosophical principles.[^116] The volume and quality of his literary works further demonstrate his intellectual accomplishments.[^117]

American missionary Homer Hulbert, writing in the early 20th century, described Yeongjo's reign as "one of the most brilliant" in Joseon's history—an assessment that reflected both his reforms and the cultural flourishing that occurred during his reign.[^118] This positive evaluation from a Western observer suggests that Yeongjo's achievements were impressive even by international standards of effective monarchy.

Modern scholars studying the renaissance of late Joseon emphasize that the cultural, intellectual, and economic flourishing under Yeongjo and Jeongjo represented the dynasty's final golden age.[^119] During this period, Confucianization reached its height, economic recovery from earlier wars was consolidated, and Korean intellectual life achieved new sophistication.[^120]

Legal historians praise the Sok-Daejeon compilation as a monumental achievement that modernized Joseon's legal framework by systematizing centuries of accumulated legal precedents and royal orders into a coherent code.[^121] This work demonstrated Yeongjo's understanding that institutions must evolve to remain relevant and effective.

Social historians note Yeongjo's humanitarian reforms, including his ban on certain forms of judicial torture, his compassion toward animals, and his efforts to increase social mobility for commoners' children.[^122] These reforms reveal a monarch who, despite being a product of his era, possessed moral sensibilities that were progressive for his time.

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptics have focused primarily on several aspects of King Yeongjo's reign and character. The most damning criticism centers on the Crown Prince Sado tragedy, which some scholars interpret as an act of profound cruelty that revealed the darkest aspects of absolute monarchy.[^123] Even those who accept that Sado suffered from mental illness question whether execution was the only option, asking why exile or confinement were not considered.[^124]

Some historians have questioned whether Yeongjo's ascension to the throne was entirely legitimate, pointing to the suspicious circumstances of King Gyeongjong's death and the absence of documented evidence for King Sukjong's alleged designation of Yeongjo as heir.[^125] The Yi In-jwa Rebellion of 1728 demonstrated that these legitimacy questions were not merely academic but had real political consequences, with radical Soron faction members willing to take up arms based on their belief that Yeongjo was not the rightful king.[^126]

Critics of the Tangpyeongchaek argue that while Yeongjo proclaimed a policy of balance and impartiality, his actual governance showed favoritism toward the Noron faction that had supported his succession.[^127] The banishment of extremist Soron leaders to remote posts following the 1728 rebellion, while perhaps politically necessary, contradicted the spirit of genuine factional reconciliation.[^128]

Some scholars point to the inherent contradictions in Yeongjo's character: a king who showed compassion to animals and reduced his own meals out of concern for his people, yet ordered his own son to die in a rice chest.[^129] These contradictions raise questions about the psychological costs of absolute power and the dehumanizing effects of Confucian ideology when applied inflexibly to family relationships.

The marriage to 13-year-old Queen Jeongsun when he was 64 years old, while not unusual for the era, reflects practices that modern sensibilities find deeply troubling.[^130] Critics note that such marriages, even if politically motivated, reflect a system that treated women, particularly young women, as political instruments rather than autonomous individuals.

Some historians have questioned whether Yeongjo's reforms were as comprehensive or effective as his admirers suggest. They note that despite taxation reforms, the fundamental structure of aristocratic privilege remained intact, and social mobility for commoners, while increased, remained severely limited.[^131] The Tangpyeongchaek reduced but did not eliminate factional strife, which would continue to plague Joseon politics in subsequent reigns.

Finally, revisionist scholars examining the Hanjoong-Rok with skepticism argue that we may never know the full truth about Crown Prince Sado, as the primary sources were written by individuals with political motivations to portray events in particular ways.[^132] This uncertainty means that Yeongjo's most controversial act may forever remain ambiguous, neither fully justified nor fully condemned by historical evidence.
