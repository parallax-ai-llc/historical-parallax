## Summary

In July 1995, in a town the United Nations had declared a "safe area," Bosnian Serb forces systematically murdered more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys. This was not the chaos of battle. It was organized, methodical execution—victims were separated from their families, transported to killing sites, shot, and buried in mass graves. The Srebrenica genocide was the worst atrocity in Europe since the Holocaust.[^1]

The men were told they would be exchanged as prisoners. Instead, they were taken to fields, warehouses, and farms, lined up, and shot. When the bullets ran low, they used clubs and knives. Then they brought in bulldozers to bury the evidence. Some victims were still alive when they were covered with earth.[^2]

This happened while 400 Dutch UN peacekeepers watched, powerless and poorly equipped. It happened while the world debated. It happened in Europe, fifty years after "Never Again." When General Ratko Mladić walked into Srebrenica on July 11, 1995, he told his camera crew: "Here we are in Serbian Srebrenica... the time has come to take revenge on the Turks." The next few days proved he meant it.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Yugoslavia's Collapse

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, created after World War II, began to disintegrate in 1991:

- **Six republics:** Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia
- **Three major peoples in Bosnia:** Bosniaks (Muslims), Serbs, Croats
- **1991:** Slovenia and Croatia declared independence
- **1992:** Bosnia-Herzegovina voted for independence
- **Bosnian Serbs, backed by Serbia, refused to accept:** War began[^4]

### Bosnian War (1992-1995)

The Bosnian War was characterized by:

- **Siege of Sarajevo:** 1,425 days—longest siege in modern warfare
- **Ethnic cleansing:** All sides committed atrocities, but Serb forces were most systematic
- **Concentration camps:** Notorious sites like Omarska and Trnopolje
- **Rape as weapon:** Systematic sexual violence against Bosniak women
- **Death toll:** Approximately 100,000 killed; 2 million displaced[^5]

### Srebrenica Enclave

**Location:** A small town in eastern Bosnia, surrounded by Serbian territory

**Before the war:** Population approximately 37,000 (mostly Bosniak)

**During the war:**
- Tens of thousands of Bosniaks fled to Srebrenica from surrounding areas
- Population swelled to 40,000-60,000 refugees
- Enclave besieged by Bosnian Serb forces
- Constant shelling; humanitarian crisis

**April 1993:** UN Security Council declared Srebrenica a "safe area" under Resolution 819
- Bosniak forces required to disarm
- UN peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) deployed
- But force was inadequate: 600 lightly armed Dutch troops (Dutchbat)
- No mandate to use force offensively[^6]

### Directive 7

In March 1995, Radovan Karadžić, President of Republika Srpska, issued **Directive 7**:

> "By planned and well-thought-out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica and Žepa."

This was an order to eliminate the Muslim population through misery and fear—or by other means if necessary.[^7]

## The Fall of Srebrenica

### July 6-10: The Attack

**July 6:**
- Bosnian Serb forces launched attack from the south
- Code name: Operation Krivaja 95
- Initial target: reduce enclave, not capture town
- Shelling of UN observation posts

**July 8:**
- Serb forces overran UN Observation Post Foxtrot
- Dutchbat soldiers taken hostage by Serbs

**July 9:**
- Attack intensified
- Karadžić ordered complete takeover
- Thousands of civilians fled toward Srebrenica town
- Dutch commander Colonel Karremans requested NATO air support

**July 10:**
- Air support requests delayed by bureaucratic confusion
- "Close air support" vs. "air strikes" debate
- Meanwhile, Serb forces advanced[^8]

### July 11: Srebrenica Falls

**Morning:**
- Limited NATO airstrikes on Serb positions
- Serbs threatened to kill Dutch hostages and shell refugees
- Airstrikes stopped

**Afternoon:**
- Bosnian Serb forces entered Srebrenica
- Minimal resistance
- Chaos as civilians fled

**Potočari:**
- 20,000-25,000 people fled to Dutch UN base at Potočari
- Mostly women, children, elderly
- Conditions desperate: no food, water, shelter

**The Column:**
- 10,000-15,000 Bosniak men and boys refused to trust the UN
- They formed a column and attempted to walk through forests to Bosnian-held Tuzla (40 km)
- Many were armed, but lightly
- It was their only hope[^9]

### Mladić Arrives

**Evening of July 11:**
- General Ratko Mladić entered Srebrenica
- Filmed with his troops, triumphant
- Told camera: "Here we are, on July 11, 1995, in Serbian Srebrenica"
- Declared he was taking revenge for centuries-old Ottoman conquest

**Hotel Fontana meetings:**
- Mladić met Dutchbat commander Karremans and Bosniak representatives
- Demanded "evacuation" of civilian population
- Threatened massacre if conditions not met[^10]

---

## The Genocide

### July 12-13: Separation

**At Potočari:**
- Bosnian Serb soldiers entered the compound
- Men and boys (ages 12-77) separated from women and children
- Women put on buses and "evacuated" to Bosnian-held territory
- Men taken aside for "interrogation"

**The women knew:**
- Screaming, pleading, begging
- Soldiers pulled sons from mothers' arms
- Some women saw husbands and sons for the last time
- Boys as young as 12 taken away

**The number:** Approximately 1,000-2,000 men and boys separated at Potočari[^11]

### July 13-17: Mass Executions

The separated men were transported to killing sites across the Bratunac and Zvornik municipalities:

**Kravica Warehouse (July 13):**
- 1,000+ men and boys packed into agricultural warehouse
- Grenades thrown through windows
- Automatic gunfire
- Few survivors

**Orahovac School (July 14):**
- Prisoners held in gymnasium
- Taken to fields in groups
- Shot in rows
- Bulldozers buried bodies

**Branjevo Military Farm (July 16):**
- Mass execution site
- Survivors reported being forced to call out as if "nothing was wrong"
- Then shot in batches

**And many more sites:**
- Petkovci Dam
- Kozluk
- Pilica Cultural Center
- Killed in fields, schools, warehouses[^12]

### The Column

Meanwhile, the column of 10,000-15,000 attempting to reach Tuzla:

- Ambushed repeatedly
- Shelled and shot
- Many surrendered after promises of safety; then executed
- Serbs used stolen UN uniforms and equipment to trick civilians
- First survivors reached Tuzla on July 16
- But thousands never arrived
- Many killed in the forests; others captured and executed[^13]

### Method of Killing

- Primarily **shooting** with automatic weapons
- Victims blindfolded and hands tied
- Lined up in rows
- Some begged for water before death
- Wounded killed with additional shots
- **Some buried alive** when bulldozers covered mass graves
- Bodies later exhumed and reburied in secondary graves to hide evidence[^14]

---

## Death Toll

**Official confirmed:**
- 8,372 victims identified by DNA (as of 2023)
- Youngest victim: 14 years old
- Oldest victim: 77 years old

**Additional:**
- Over 6,500 bodies exhumed from 60+ mass graves
- Some victims found in multiple graves (bodies moved)
- Approximately 1,000 still missing

**The scale:** The killing of 8,000+ people in a few days makes Srebrenica the largest mass murder in Europe since World War II.[^15]

## Why It Happened

### Immediate Factors

1. **Inadequate UN force:** 400 lightly armed troops against 2,000 Serb soldiers
2. **No mandate to fight:** Peacekeepers had no orders to defend
3. **Air support failure:** Bureaucratic delays, hostage threats
4. **Bosniak disarmament:** Muslims had given up heavy weapons trusting UN protection

### Structural Factors

1. **Ethnic nationalism:** Serbian nationalist ideology sought "Greater Serbia"
2. **Dehumanization:** Years of propaganda portrayed Bosniaks as "Turks" and enemies
3. **Historical grievances:** Ottoman conquest used as propaganda
4. **International indifference:** Europe and US refused to intervene decisively

### Political Will

The fundamental failure: **There was no will to stop it.**

- European powers hesitated
- US avoided entanglement
- Russia supported Serbia
- The UN Security Council was paralyzed

8,000 people died because the world decided Srebrenica wasn't worth fighting for.[^16]

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate

**July 1995:**
- Women reached Bosnian territory, began reporting atrocities
- International outcry grew
- NATO airstrikes against Serb positions intensified (after it was too late for Srebrenica)

**November 1995:**
- Dayton Peace Agreement ended Bosnian War
- Bosnia divided into two entities: Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska
- Srebrenica fell within Republika Srpska

### Justice

**International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY):**
- Established 1993; closed 2017
- Prosecuted key perpetrators
- **2004:** ICTY confirmed Srebrenica was genocide
- **2007:** International Court of Justice confirmed genocide

**Key convictions:**
- Radovan Karadžić: Genocide, crimes against humanity—life sentence
- Ratko Mladić: Genocide, crimes against humanity—life sentence
- Many VRS officers convicted

**Netherlands:**
- 2002: Dutch government resigned over Srebrenica failure
- 2019: Dutch state held partially liable for deaths of 350 victims[^17]

### Memory and Denial

**Srebrenica Memorial Center:**
- Potočari site transformed into memorial
- Over 6,500 victims buried in memorial cemetery
- Annual commemoration July 11

**Denial:**
- Some Serb politicians continue to deny genocide
- Republika Srpska government has challenged the term "genocide"
- Denial remains obstacle to reconciliation[^18]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Was It Genocide?

**Legal determination:**
- 2004: ICTY ruled Srebrenica was genocide
- 2007: International Court of Justice confirmed
- Definition: "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"
- The systematic targeting of Bosniak males to destroy the community fulfilled this definition

**Significance:**
- First legally recognized genocide in Europe since Holocaust
- Established precedent for future international law[^19]

### Lessons

**What Srebrenica teaches:**

1. **"Safe areas" require enforcement:** Paper guarantees mean nothing without force
2. **Early intervention saves lives:** The war could have been shortened years earlier
3. **Genocide is deliberate:** It doesn't "happen"—it is planned and executed
4. **International community can fail:** "Never again" requires action, not words
5. **Justice is possible but slow:** Prosecutions came, but decades later

### Parallel Events

Srebrenica was not unique—it was the worst of a pattern:

- Vukovar (1991): Croatian town; 264+ civilians massacred
- Višegrad (1992): Bosniaks killed, raped, burned
- Prijedor (1992): Concentration camps; mass killings
- **But Srebrenica was the largest, most systematic, most documented**[^20]

## Legacy

### For Bosnia

- Srebrenica remains divided community
- Bosniak families slowly returning
- Serb population dominant in Republika Srpska
- Reconciliation incomplete
- Annual mourning every July 11

### For Europe

- Exposed weakness of EU/UN in crisis
- Led to reform of peacekeeping doctrine
- Influenced development of Responsibility to Protect (R2P)
- Haunts European conscience

### For International Justice

- ICTY prosecutions established precedents
- Proved international courts could deliver verdicts
- Model for International Criminal Court
- But impunity still widespread globally

### Ongoing

**2025:** Trial of "Soldier F" and others continues
- 30th anniversary approaching
- New generation learns the history
- Survivors' testimony preserved
- Question remains: Has the world truly learned?[^21]
