## Summary

Ronald Fisher was a British statistician and geneticist who is described as 'the single most important figure in 20th century statistics.' He developed analysis of variance (ANOVA), maximum likelihood estimation, and Fisher's exact test. He also helped found population genetics through 'The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection.' His work unified Mendelian genetics with Darwinian evolution. His views on eugenics remain controversial.
