## Overview

Watergate was a political espionage scandal that brought down the presidency of Richard Nixon. It began with the arrest of five burglars breaking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972. The investigation—led by journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and special prosecutors—revealed that the burglary was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage directed by the White House. The subsequent cover-up, orchestrated by Nixon himself (proven by the "smoking gun" tape), led to his resignation on August 8, 1974—the only U.S. president to resign.
