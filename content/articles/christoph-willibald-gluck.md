## Summary

Christoph Willibald Gluck was a German-Bohemian composer who reformed opera by stripping away vocal excess to create a more natural, dramatically truthful art form. His operas Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste established principles that influenced all subsequent operatic development. His reforms bridged Baroque opera seria and Classical opera.
