## Summary

In the winter of 2013-2014, Ukrainians did something that still reverberates across Europe: they camped in the freezing cold of Kyiv's central square, built barricades from snow and tires, and ultimately toppled their president—at the cost of over 100 lives. The Euromaidan revolution, or "Revolution of Dignity," began as a protest for European integration and became a battle for Ukraine's future.[^1]

When President Viktor Yanukovych rejected an association agreement with the European Union in November 2013, opting instead for Russian aid, students gathered in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square). When police beat them, the country erupted. For three months, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians occupied the Maidan, facing water cannons in sub-zero temperatures, molotov cocktails against snipers. On February 20, 2014, over 100 protesters were shot dead by government forces. The next day, Yanukovych fled.[^2]

The revolution succeeded in ousting the president but triggered a Russian backlash that continues to this day. Within weeks, Russia annexed Crimea and fomented war in eastern Ukraine. The "Heavenly Hundred"—the protesters killed on the Maidan—became martyrs of a nation that, eight years later, would face full-scale Russian invasion. The seeds of the 2022 war were planted in the barricades of 2014.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Ukraine at the Crossroads

**Since independence (1991):**
- Ukraine torn between West and Russia
- Oligarchic politics; rampant corruption
- Orange Revolution (2004): Yanukovych's first election stolen; overturned by protests
- Yanukovych eventually elected properly (2010)

**Viktor Yanukovych:**
- President 2010-2014
- Backed by eastern, Russian-speaking Ukraine
- Close to Russia and Putin
- Increasingly authoritarian
- Corruption on massive scale (later revealed)[^4]

### The EU Association Agreement

**The promise:**
- Ukraine had been negotiating EU Association Agreement
- Not EU membership, but closer ties
- Trade benefits; visa liberalization
- Reform requirements

**November 21, 2013:**
- Yanukovych suddenly suspended agreement
- Accepted Russian bailout ($15 billion) instead
- Pressure from Putin (threatened trade war)

**For many Ukrainians, this was a betrayal of European aspirations.**[^5]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Succeed?

**Factors:**
1. **Mass participation:** Hundreds of thousands sustained
2. **Security force splits:** Some Berkut defected; military stayed neutral
3. **Regime brutality backfired:** Each attack brought more protesters
4. **International pressure:** EU, US condemned violence
5. **Geographic divisions:** But Kyiv was unified

### What Did It Mean?

**For Ukraine:**
- End of Yanukovych-style authoritarianism
- Stronger civil society
- But also: Russian intervention, war, ongoing conflict

**For the World:**
- Russia's response showed its intentions
- Post-Cold War order shattered
- Led ultimately to 2022 invasion

### The Question of Snipers

**Who fired on February 20?**
- Official: Government forces
- Russia claims: Provocateurs
- Investigation complicated
- Some evidence of multiple shooters

**Whatever the truth, the government bore responsibility for the bloodshed.**[^12]

## Legacy

### Commemoration

**Heavenly Hundred:**
- Streets, squares renamed
- February 20: National day
- Memorials at Maidan
- Heroes of Ukrainian independence

### Ongoing Significance

**2022 invasion:**
- Russia cited Euromaidan as "coup"
- Ukraine invoked Euromaidan spirit
- Same flag, same struggle

**The revolution continues.**[^13]
