## Summary

Philip Glass (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer and pianist who has become one of the most influential and commercially successful composers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries[^1]. A principal figure in the establishment of musical minimalism, Glass has created a distinctive compositional style characterized by repetitive structures and gradually evolving patterns that have profoundly shaped contemporary classical music[^2]. With over 25 operas, 15 symphonies, numerous film scores, and countless chamber works to his credit, Glass has built bridges between classical music, popular culture, and world music traditions, earning both widespread acclaim and fierce criticism throughout his career[^3][^4]. At age 87, he remains active as a composer and continues to influence generations of musicians across diverse genres[^5].

## Early Life and Background

Philip Glass was born on January 31, 1937, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Jewish immigrant parents from Latvia and Russia[^6]. His father, Benjamin Charles Glass, owned a record store, while his mother, Ida Gouline Glass, worked as a librarian[^7]. This familial environment proved formative for young Philip's musical development. Working in his father's store, Glass discovered modern classical music by listening to unsold records that customers didn't want, building a collection that included works by Hindemith, Bartók, Schoenberg, Shostakovich, Beethoven's string quartets, and Schubert's chamber music[^8]. This early exposure to challenging, unconventional music would profoundly shape his aesthetic sensibilities.

Glass's formal musical education began remarkably early. He started studying violin at age six, then took up the flute at age eight through an accelerated program at the Peabody Conservatory[^9]. By age 12, he had already begun composing music[^10]. His intellectual development was equally precocious. In 1952, at just 15 years old, Glass entered the University of Chicago as part of a program for gifted youth[^11]. There he studied mathematics and philosophy under the tutelage of piano teacher Marcus Rasking, who introduced him to 12-tone music technique[^12]. Glass earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in liberal arts at the remarkably young age of 19 in 1956[^13].

In the aftermath of World War II, Glass's mother demonstrated exceptional compassion by aiding Jewish Holocaust survivors, inviting recent arrivals to America to stay at their home until they could find employment and housing[^14]. This humanitarian spirit ran in the family—Glass's sister Sheppie would later become an active member of the International Rescue Committee[^15]. These formative experiences instilled in Glass values of social consciousness and cultural openness that would characterize his later collaborations across diverse musical traditions.

## Rise to Prominence

After leaving Baltimore, Glass enrolled at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City in 1956 as a composition student[^16]. At Juilliard, he studied composition with William Bergsma and Vincent Persichetti and piano with Gordon Stanley[^17]. He also studied at Aspen with the renowned composer Darius Milhaud[^18]. After completing his studies at Juilliard in 1962 with a Master of Science degree, Glass moved to Pittsburgh and worked as a school-based composer-in-residence in the public school system[^19].

The truly transformative period of Glass's development came in 1964 when he received a Fulbright Scholarship to study in Paris with the legendary pedagogue Nadia Boulanger[^20]. From autumn 1964 to summer 1966, Glass studied with Boulanger, who was renowned for her unrelenting teaching of the basics of central European music—harmony, counterpoint, and related techniques[^21]. Boulanger's influence on Glass's understanding of musical fundamentals would prove lifelong.

While in Paris, Glass encountered an experience that would revolutionize his compositional approach. In 1964, he took a job transcribing music for Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar, who had been invited to Paris to write the score for the film *Chappaqua*[^22]. Glass had never even heard Indian music before this encounter[^23]. Working with Ravi Shankar exposed Glass to a tradition of music fundamentally different from Western classical music—Indian music has no root movement or harmonic movement in the Western sense[^24]. Glass also studied with Alla Rakha, Shankar's great tabla player and music partner, practicing the endless cycles of 2s and 3s that form the heart of the Indian tal system[^25].

Glass later reflected that by his second year in Paris, he was working with Ravi Shankar in a tradition of music that was very different but obviously of a very sophisticated nature, with its own history and rules[^26]. Almost immediately, Glass began to experiment with the idea of taking the training he had from Boulanger and mixing it with the work he had been doing with Ravi Shankar[^27]. Glass's admitted artistic breakthrough came while working with Ravi Shankar on transcribing Indian music; the experience inspired him to begin structuring music by rhythmic phrases instead of by notation[^28]. Glass later stated: "The door to world music for me was opened by Ravi Shankar"[^29].

Glass returned to New York in 1967 and founded the Philip Glass Ensemble in 1968[^30]. However, success did not come immediately. To support himself as a composer, Glass worked various odd jobs including as a plumber and taxi driver at night[^31]. He started taking on plumbing jobs even though he had no experience in the field, getting advice from workers at the plumbing supply store on Eighth Avenue near 18th Street[^32]. One famous anecdote from this period recalls Glass installing a dishwasher when he heard a noise and looked up to find Robert Hughes, the art critic of *Time* magazine, staring at him in disbelief[^33].

In the mid-1970s, Glass decided he needed work that was less physically draining and with more flexible hours, so he became a taxi driver[^34]. He gave up plumbing because swinging heavy wrenches all day made it difficult to play the piano in the evening[^35]. Glass worked as a cab driver from 1973 to 1978, picking up his taxi at the Dover Garage in Greenwich Village in the late afternoon, typically taking fares until well after midnight[^36]. After returning home around 1:30 AM, he would stay up the rest of the night working on his compositions[^37]. Much of *Einstein on the Beach* was written this way[^38]. Remarkably, even after the premiere of *Einstein on the Beach* at the Metropolitan Opera in 1976, the 39-year-old Glass went back to driving a cab and kept at it for the next three years[^39].

## Major Achievements

Glass's breakthrough came in 1976 with *Einstein on the Beach*, created in close collaboration with the Texan producer, stage designer, and librettist Robert Wilson[^40]. Composed in spring to fall of 1975, this opera premiered on July 25, 1976, at the Théâtre Municipal in Avignon, France, as part of the Avignon Festival[^41]. The opera was also staged that summer in Hamburg, Paris, Belgrade, Venice, Brussels, and Rotterdam[^42]. In November 1976, the Byrd Hoffman Foundation in cooperation with the Metropolitan Opera held two sold-out performances at the Metropolitan Opera House[^43].

*Einstein on the Beach* is Glass's first, longest, and most famous opera, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission[^44]. Given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired[^45]. The nonnarrative theatrical piece helped create a new and varied audience for minimalist music[^46]. After its Met debut, *The New York Times* critic Clive Barnes wrote: "I have rarely heard a first-night audience respond so vociferously at the Metropolitan Opera House as for this bizarre, occasionally boring, yet always intermittently beautiful theater piece"[^47].

Following *Einstein on the Beach*, Glass created what became known as his "Portrait Trilogy"—three operas examining transformative historical figures[^48]. *Satyagraha* (1980) follows the early life of Mahatma Gandhi as he began his political career as a lawyer in South Africa[^49]. It premiered on September 5, 1980, at the Stadsschouwburg Theater in Rotterdam[^50]. Although the opera is about Gandhi, each of the three acts is named after a related influential figure: Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, and Martin Luther King Jr.[^51]. *Akhnaten* (1983) is an opera in three acts based on the life and religious convictions of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, exploring the theme of monotheism[^52]. The New York Metropolitan Opera's production of *Akhnaten* won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 2022[^53].

Glass's contributions to film music have been equally significant. In 1983, he composed the score for *Koyaanisqatsi*, described as his first foray into film composition[^54]. The score is a prime example of the minimalist school of composition, and the Philip Glass Ensemble has toured the world playing the music live in front of the movie screen[^55]. He followed this with *Powaqqatsi* (1988), the sequel to *Koyaanisqatsi*[^56]. In 1997, Glass scored Martin Scorsese's film *Kundun*, for which he received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score[^57]. His 2002 score for *The Hours* won him a BAFTA Award for Best Original Music and earned nominations for both an Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album[^58]. He received a third Oscar nomination for his score to *Notes on a Scandal* (2006)[^59].

Glass's symphonic output includes 15 symphonies to date. His Symphony No. 1, known as the "Low Symphony" (1992), is based on David Bowie and Brian Eno's 1977 album *Low*[^60]. Glass took themes from three instrumentals on the record—"Subterraneans," "Some Are," and "Warszawa"—and combined them with material of his own[^61]. In 1996, Glass based Symphony No. 4 on Bowie's album *Heroes*, and in 2019 he based his 12th Symphony on Bowie's album *Lodger*, completing his trilogy of symphonies based on Bowie's Berlin Triptych[^62]. Glass described this work as "a real collaboration between my music and theirs"[^63]. His Symphony No. 3 (1995) for string orchestra is noted as one of his most popular works[^64].

Glass's chamber music catalog is extensive, including nine string quartets and numerous other chamber works[^65]. From the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, Glass completed eight string quartets, though the three earliest have been withdrawn, which explains why the numbering starts with String Quartet No. 1[^66]. Notable among these is String Quartet No. 3 "Mishima" and String Quartet No. 9 "King Lear" (2022)[^67].

Other major works include *Glassworks* (1982), a collection of neo-classical pieces[^68], and the song cycle *Book of Longing* (2008), a setting of poems by Leonard Cohen[^69]. Glass has also composed music for dance, working with choreographers worldwide, and has created numerous concerti for various instruments[^70].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his commercial success and popular acclaim, Glass has faced sustained and often harsh criticism from music critics and academics throughout his career. Much of the criticism centers on the repetitive nature of his music and what detractors perceive as a lack of depth or development. *The New York Times* critic Donal Henahan described Glass's opera *Akhnaten* as "one more example of going-nowhere music" with "backgrounds of continually repeated, barely varied sound patterns" that "stand to music as the sentence 'See Spot run' stands to literature"[^71].

Composer Ned Rorem famously dismissed Glass's music as "all style and no content"[^72]. Writer Jan Swafford described Glass's music in equally harsh terms: "Simple rippling lines repeated over and over" where "the ideas, which are not necessarily interesting to begin with, do not become any more interesting"[^73]. Glass's music has been called "classical music for people who don't like classical music," targeting the rock/pop crowd, with criticism of its "simple harmonic and melodic palette and excessive repetition"[^74].

The label "minimalism" itself has been a source of controversy. Glass himself loathes the term, preferring to describe his compositions as "music with repetitive structures"[^75]. He argues that "minimalism" might belie the complex surface of this music and the intricacy with which these repetitive structures elide and interact[^76]. However, despite Glass's objections, he is often classified as a "minimalist" composer, with much of his mature work based on the extended repetition of brief, elegant melodic fragments that weave in and out of an aural tapestry[^77].

Academic reception has been particularly mixed. *Grove Music Online* notes that Glass "has become one of the most commercially successful, and critically reviled, composers of his generation"[^78]. The Oxford Bibliographies entry on Glass observes that "we still await a rigorous assessment of his achievements, above all in the hybrid forms of music theater"[^79]. Many biographies lack a critical framework or substantive musical analyses[^80]. Today, music professors and students still debate whether Glass's music holds any merit[^81].

However, some critics have changed their opinions over time. Robert T. Jones, who initially trivialized Glass's music in 1969, years later praised his opera *Satyagraha* and eventually edited Glass's book[^82]. One music journalist observed: "If he's looked upon more kindly today, it's not necessarily that his music evolved to match critical tastes—it's that the world caught up with him"[^83].

## Personal Life

Glass has been married four times. He married theater director Jo Anne Akalaitis in his first marriage, which ended in divorce[^84]. His second marriage was to Linda Burtyk in 1980, also ending in divorce[^85]. In 1991, Glass married Candy Jernigan, an artist and set designer[^86]. The unexpected death of Jernigan in 1991 profoundly affected Glass, and he composed an opera about Orpheus that reflected his personal grief over this loss[^87]. His fourth marriage was to Holly Critchlow, with whom he has two children[^88].

Glass's family background has had lasting influence on his life and work. In his memoir *Words Without Music*, Glass recalls that at the end of World War II, his mother aided Jewish Holocaust survivors, inviting recent arrivals to America to stay at their home until they could find jobs and places to live[^89]. His sister Sheppie continued this humanitarian work as an active member of the International Rescue Committee[^90]. Additionally, Ira Glass, the popular host of "This American Life" on NPR, is Glass's cousin[^91].

Despite his public persona as one of the world's most famous living composers, Glass has maintained a relatively private personal life, focusing primarily on his music and family. He has described the solitary nature of composition: "Finally, ultimately, you write music for yourself. I mean, I need a public, I need people to play, I need everything else. I'm not working in isolation. But finally the man that writes the music is alone"[^92].

Glass maintains a rigorous work ethic, stating: "I work every morning without fail. You practice and you get better. It's very simple"[^93]. He has spoken about the creative process in philosophical terms: "If you don't know what to do, there's actually a chance of doing something new. As long as you know what you're doing, nothing much of interest is going to happen"[^94].

## Legacy

Philip Glass's influence on contemporary music is profound and multifaceted. His artistic voice is so distinctive and strongly chimes with our contemporary aesthetic that its reach has become ubiquitous and its influence indelible[^95]. He is considered by some to be one of the most influential contemporary composers[^96]. Glass has created a mass following and brought new audiences to contemporary opera, fundamentally changing the landscape of classical music[^97].

Glass's contributions have reshaped contemporary classical music and bridged the gap between modernist traditions and popular culture[^98]. His influence extends across diverse musical genres and artistic disciplines. Early admirers of his minimalism include musicians Brian Eno and David Bowie[^99]. His influence could be heard in the rock music of Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd[^100]. One observer noted: "Glass's music can be found not only at the opera where he reigns supreme as America's most successful living composer, but at the ballet, on television, in symphony halls, films, jazz clubs, and even the occasional sports stadium"[^101].

Glass's influence is everywhere in contemporary composition—whether in the moody patterns of the music by Debbie Wiseman for the TV adaptation of *Wolf Hall*, the technical underpinning of Nico Muhly's opera *Marnie*, and numerous examples of new-generation minimalism by the likes of Max Richter, Timo Andres, Kevin Volans, David Lang, and many more[^102]. The impact of Glass extends beyond the realms of music, igniting inspiration across diverse artistic disciplines, from pop music to visual arts[^103].

Glass has "almost single-handedly, crafted the dominant sound of late-twentieth-century classical music"[^104]. His creative collaborations with leading rock, pop, and world music artists date back to the 1960s and include works with Laurie Anderson, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Brian Eno, and Ravi Shankar[^105]. Glass forged an alternative path into classical music, creating accessibility without sacrificing artistic integrity[^106].

In 2015, Glass published his memoir *Words Without Music*, which became a *New York Times* bestseller and won the Chicago Tribune Literary Award[^107]. The memoir covers Glass's journey from childhood in Baltimore to student days in Chicago and at Juilliard, to his first journey to Paris and a life-changing trip to India, discussing studies with Ravi Shankar and Nadia Boulanger and collaborations with Robert Wilson, Allen Ginsberg, Godfrey Reggio, and Martin Scorsese[^108]. The book has been praised as "an engaging, even charming book, one of the most readable autobiographies ever written by a classical composer"[^109].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Glass's work emphasize his revolutionary approach to composition and his success in making contemporary classical music accessible to broad audiences. The *New York Times* has called Glass "the most prolific and popular of all contemporary composers"[^110]. Supporters argue that Glass created "an entirely new and unexpected voice" that allowed life to merge with art in unprecedented ways[^111].

Academic supporters highlight Glass's sophisticated use of rhythm and structure. Glass himself has articulated his philosophy: "What came to me as a revelation was the use of rhythm in developing an overall structure in music"[^112]. He learned from "studying with Alla Rakha, Ravi Shankar's great tabla player and music partner, I practiced the endless cycles of 2s and 3s that form the heart of the Indian tal system. From this I learned the tools by which apparent chaos could be heard as an unending array of shifting beats and patterns"[^113].

Glass's advocates point to his philosophy of music as a social art form: "Music is a social art form. It grows out of relationships with other people and depends on them. I think music is about emotion, and I want to give the audience an emotional experience"[^114]. He has also stated: "I am interested in the interplay between silence and sound, as well as the spaces in between"[^115].

Supporters also note that Glass's influence has been validated by the sheer number of major composers he has influenced and the ubiquity of his aesthetic in contemporary culture. His ability to bring together Western classical training with non-Western musical traditions, particularly Indian classical music, created entirely new possibilities for composition[^116]. The fact that his music has found audiences not only in opera houses but also in films, rock concerts, and popular culture demonstrates his success in transcending traditional boundaries[^117].

### Negative Views

Critics maintain that Glass's repetitive approach represents a fundamental impoverishment of musical language rather than an innovation. The criticism that Glass's music is "all style and no content" reflects a deeper concern that the repetitive structures lack the developmental logic and harmonic sophistication of the Western classical tradition[^118]. Critics argue that the simple harmonic and melodic palette and excessive repetition do not reward repeated listening in the way that more complex classical works do[^119].

Academic critics have noted that scholarly assessment of Glass's work lags behind his commercial success. The observation from *Writings on Glass* that "we still await a rigorous assessment of his achievements" suggests that serious musicological engagement with Glass's work has been limited[^120]. The Oxford Bibliographies' comment that many biographies "lack a critical framework or substantive musical analyses" points to a gap between Glass's popular reception and serious scholarly engagement[^121].

Some critics view Glass's music as pandering to popular tastes at the expense of artistic integrity. The characterization of his music as "classical music for people who don't like classical music" suggests that Glass's accessibility comes at the cost of depth and complexity[^122]. The ongoing debates among music professors and students about whether Glass's music "holds any merit" indicate that serious questions about his artistic value persist in academic circles[^123].

Critics also point to what they perceive as a lack of evolution in Glass's compositional approach. While Glass has continued to produce enormous quantities of music, some critics argue that his fundamental approach has remained static, with later works not demonstrating significant development beyond his early minimalist innovations[^124]. The harsh assessment that Glass's music consists of "simple rippling lines repeated over and over" where "the ideas, which are not necessarily interesting to begin with, do not become any more interesting" encapsulates this critical perspective[^125].
