## Overview

In January 1998, the Drudge Report broke the news that President Bill Clinton had an affair with a 22-year-old White House intern, **Monica Lewinsky**. The scandal consumed American politics for a year. It wasn't just about sex; it was about lying under oath (perjury) in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
Clinton famously denied it: *"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."*
But Lewinsky had kept a **blue dress** with the President's DNA on it.
This led to Clinton becoming the second president in history to be impeached (though he was acquitted by the Senate).

## The Players

**Linda Tripp:** Lewinsky's "friend" who secretly recorded their phone conversations and handed the tapes to Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
**Kenneth Starr:** The relentless prosecutor who expanded his investigation from Whitewater (real estate) to the President's sex life.
**Hillary Clinton:** Blamed a "vast right-wing conspiracy."

## Impact

**Political Polarization:**
The impeachment became a partisan war, setting the tone for the brutal divide in US politics today.
