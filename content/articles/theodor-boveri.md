## Summary

Theodor Boveri was a German biologist who, along with Walter Sutton, proposed the chromosome theory of inheritance — that chromosomes carry genes and are the physical basis of Mendel's laws of heredity. He also hypothesized that cancer is caused by abnormal chromosomes, a prediction confirmed decades later. His work on sea urchin embryos was groundbreaking.
