## Summary

Takaaki Kajita is a Japanese physicist who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass. He led the Super-Kamiokande experiment that demonstrated atmospheric neutrinos change flavor. This discovery contradicted the Standard Model's assumption that neutrinos are massless. His work opened a new window into physics beyond the Standard Model.
