## Summary

Abū Naṣr Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Fārābī (c. 870–950 CE), known as Alpharabius in the Latin West, was one of the preeminent thinkers of medieval Islam and a foundational figure in Islamic philosophy.[^1] Regarded in the medieval Islamic world as the greatest philosophical authority after Aristotle, he earned the honorific title "The Second Master" (al-Mu'allim al-Thani), with Aristotle being the first.[^2] His intellectual contributions spanned metaphysics, political philosophy, logic, epistemology, music theory, and ethics, establishing him as the "Father of Islamic Neoplatonism" and the "Founder of Islamic Political Philosophy."[^3] Al-Farabi's synthesis of Greek philosophy with Islamic thought profoundly influenced subsequent philosophers including Avicenna, Averroes, and medieval European scholars such as Thomas Aquinas.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Al-Farabi was probably born in 870 CE (AH 257) at Wasij, a village in the vicinity of Farab (modern-day Otrar) in Transoxiana, located in what is now southern Kazakhstan.[^5] The district of Farab was situated on the middle Syr Darya river at its confluence with the Arys river.[^6] While scholars largely agree that his precise ethnic background is not knowable, medieval sources describe him as being of either Persian or Turkic origin, with more recent research pointing to Persian ancestry.[^7] According to Ibn Abi Usaibia, one of al-Farabi's oldest biographers, his father was of Persian descent and served as a military officer (qa'id jaysh) in the army of the Samanid rulers.[^8] Majid Fakhry, an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University, confirms that al-Farabi's father "was an army captain of Persian extraction."[^9]

The basis of al-Farabi's early education was religious and linguistic: he studied jurisprudence, Hadith, and the exegesis of the Qur'an.[^10] He completed his primary education at Farab and Bukhara before embarking on a journey that would transform him into one of history's greatest philosophers.[^11] Little is known about his family life or early years, as medieval Arab historians of the 12th-13th centuries had few reliable facts and often relied on invented stories about his life.[^12] What is certain is that al-Farabi came from a respectable family that valued learning and provided him with opportunities for intellectual development.

Around 901 CE, al-Farabi arrived in Baghdad to pursue higher studies, entering the vibrant intellectual hub of the Islamic world.[^13] In Baghdad, he immersed himself in the study of grammar, logic, philosophy, music, mathematics, and sciences.[^14] He became a pupil of Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus (d. 940), a Nestorian Christian who was a renowned translator and logician instrumental in transmitting Greek philosophical thought to the Islamic world.[^15] Under Abu Bishr Matta, al-Farabi studied the Aristotelian Organon, covering Porphyry's Eisagoge and Aristotle's Categories, De Interpretatione, and Prior and Posterior Analytics.[^16] Later, he studied under another Nestorian Christian scholar, Yuhanna ibn Haylan (d. 941), in Harran.[^17] This connection placed al-Farabi within the Alexandrian school of philosophy, which had relocated from Alexandria to Harran, Antakya, and Merv before definitively settling in Baghdad.[^18]

## Rise to Prominence

Al-Farabi spent most of his scholarly life in Baghdad, where he worked alongside Syriac Christian scholars including Yahya ibn Adi and Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Baghdadi.[^19] During this period, he accumulated such profound knowledge of philosophy that he earned the name "The Second Teacher," in reference to Aristotle, "The First Teacher."[^20] His intellectual rigor and comprehensive mastery of Greek philosophy, combined with his innovative syntheses, established him as the foremost philosopher of his generation.[^21]

Al-Farabi was the first Muslim philosopher to present philosophy as a coherent system in the Islamic world, creating a comprehensive philosophical framework that integrated logic, metaphysics, ethics, and political theory.[^22] Unlike his noteworthy predecessors such as al-Kindi and al-Razi, al-Farabi was the first philosopher of his epoch to command the unqualified respect of future generations.[^23] He played a crucial role in shaping Islamic philosophy by demonstrating how Greek philosophical traditions could be harmonized with Islamic theology and adapted to address the intellectual concerns of the Muslim community.[^24]

In 943 CE, al-Farabi traveled to Syria and Damascus, and later visited Egypt, but he always returned to Baghdad.[^25] However, in 942 CE, he took up residence at the court of the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla (r. 945–967) in Aleppo, a cultural center famed for its patronage of poets like al-Mutanabbi and scholars of various disciplines.[^26] Accounts depict al-Farabi as enjoying the ruler's esteem while maintaining a simple lifestyle and declining lavish gifts.[^27] He became a constant companion of Sayf al-Dawla, and it is said that most of his major works were written during his time at the Hamdanid court.[^28] Al-Farabi seemed to have divided his time between Damascus and Aleppo during these final years of his life.[^29]

## Major Achievements

Al-Farabi's intellectual achievements were extraordinary in both scope and depth. Although many of his books have been lost, 117 are known to exist, including 43 on logic, 11 on metaphysics, 7 on ethics, 7 on political science, 17 on music, medicine and sociology, and 11 commentaries.[^30]

### Political Philosophy

Al-Farabi is best known for his political treatise "Mabadi ara ahl al-madina al-fadhila" (Principles of the Opinions of the Inhabitants of the Virtuous City), often abbreviated to "al-Madina al-fadila" (The Virtuous City).[^31] In this seminal work, he envisioned an ideal state governed by a philosopher-ruler, synthesizing Platonic concepts with Islamic thought.[^32] However, unlike Plato's monolingual and monoethnic city-state, al-Farabi envisioned a vast multicultural, multilingual, and multireligious empire.[^33] The ideal society, according to al-Farabi, is one directed toward the realization of "true happiness," with the philosopher's duty being to establish a "virtuous" society by healing the souls of the people, establishing justice, and guiding them toward happiness.[^34] Al-Farabi borrowed the Platonic concept of the philosopher-king and transformed it into the philosopher-prophet-ruler, addressing the unique religiopolitical context of Islamic civilization.[^35]

### Logic and Epistemology

Al-Farabi wrote numerous commentaries on and summaries of the Aristotelian Organon, following the tradition of Alexandrian commentators.[^36] His Long Commentaries dissected Aristotle's text in detailed fashion; only the Long Commentary on De Interpretatione survives in full, though parts of others remain.[^37] Though he was mainly an Aristotelian logician, he included non-Aristotelian elements in his works, discussing future contingents, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference including Stoic logic.[^38] He is credited with categorizing logic into two separate groups: "idea" and "proof."[^39] Al-Farabi introduced the concept of "poetic syllogism" in a commentary on Aristotle's Poetics, demonstrating his innovative approach to logical theory.[^40]

In epistemology, al-Farabi developed sophisticated theories about the nature of knowledge and certainty. Certainty, for al-Farabi, requires two conditions: to know that a proposition is true, and to know that one knows—close to what contemporary epistemology calls "second-order knowledge."[^41] He had a strict conception of demonstrative science inspired by Aristotle's Posterior Analytics, addressing epistemological topics such as scientific knowledge and the nature of demonstration and certitude in his Book of Demonstration and Book on the Conditions of Certitude.[^42]

### Theory of Intellect

Al-Farabi wrote the "Risala fi'l-'aql" (Epistle on the Intellect), a treatise titled "On the Different Meanings of the Intellect," which had wide circulation among scholars of the East and West in the Middle Ages and was translated into Latin at an early date.[^43] He identified six different senses of the term "intellect," demonstrating its multiple meanings in philosophical discourse.[^44] Al-Farabi divided the intellect into four stages: (1) potential (also known as material or passive), (2) actual or intellect in actuality, (3) acquired intellect, and (4) active or agent intellect.[^45] The first three are different states of the human intellect, while the fourth is the Tenth Intellect in his emanational cosmology.[^46] According to al-Farabi, when the human intellect consistently applies itself and apprehends an increasingly greater number of intelligibles, it attains the level of "acquired intellect," at which point it most nearly resembles the separate cosmic intelligences and the active intellect.[^47]

### Metaphysics and Cosmology

Al-Farabi's cosmology was based on three pillars: Aristotelian metaphysics of causation, Plotinian emanational cosmology, and Ptolemaic astronomy.[^48] He developed a hierarchical emanationist model with six principles: (1) the First Existent or First Cause, (2) the second intellects, (3) the active (or agent) intellect, (4) the soul, (5) form, and (6) matter.[^49] In his metaphysics, he developed a theory of emanation describing the origin of the material universe, where ten intellects or intelligences come in succession from the First Being, and from each of them, a sphere of the universe is produced.[^50] The process of emanation begins metaphysically (not temporally) with the First Cause, whose principal activity is self-contemplation.[^51] Al-Farabi replaced the Quranic doctrine of creation ex nihilo with a Neoplatonic theory of emanation from a Divine Being characterized as "the First," in whom essence and existence are absolutely one.[^52]

### Music Theory

Al-Farabi's "Kitab al-Musiqi al-Kabir" (Great Book of Music) is considered the most important medieval musical treatise in Islamic lands and includes sophisticated philosophical sections.[^53] In this work, al-Farabi not only elaborated theoretical points but also documented common musical practices of his time, bridging the gap between theory and practice.[^54] He perfected rhythmic theory and developed a notation system for rhythms, creating general formulae he named "the basics" and codifying sixteen contemporary ornamental techniques.[^55] Al-Farabi described the mathematical relationships between different musical intervals and their corresponding ratios, such as the octave (2:1), the fifth (3:2), and the fourth (4:3).[^56] Notably, he rejected Pythagorean cosmology by appealing to Aristotle's work to refute the idea that planets and stars could generate music.[^57] His work explored the therapeutic effects of music on the soul and its ability to enhance communication and expression, laying foundations for later Islamic and Western music theory.[^58]

### Classification of Sciences

Al-Farabi's groundbreaking work "Ihsa' al-'ulum" (Enumeration of the Sciences) organized human knowledge systematically and had tremendous influence in both the Islamic world and medieval Europe through its Latin translations.[^59] His systematic division of the sciences integrated the full range of Aristotle's works and a broad spectrum of sciences, many of which were new to the Latin West, and were instrumental in disseminating a comprehensive framework for understanding human knowledge.[^60]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his immense influence, al-Farabi's philosophical positions generated significant controversy and criticism, particularly from orthodox Islamic theologians.

Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), the most celebrated orthodox Islamic scholar of his time, vehemently criticized al-Farabi's philosophical approach in his classic work "Tahafut al-Falasifa" (The Incoherence of the Philosophers).[^61] Al-Ghazali disapproved of al-Farabi's inclusive philosophical position, feeling it denied the supremacy of Islam and compromised core Islamic doctrines.[^62] The tension centered on al-Farabi's use of Neoplatonic emanation rather than the Quranic doctrine of creation ex nihilo, which many theologians viewed as incompatible with Islamic theology.[^63]

Al-Farabi's theory of prophecy also generated theological debate. While Ibn Rushd (Averroes) admitted its validity and was astonished at al-Ghazali's criticism, arguing that it corroborated religious tenets and affirmed that spiritual perfection can be attained only through communion with God, orthodox theologians remained skeptical.[^64] Al-Farabi's account of religion as "essentially an instrument intended for application" that "cannot be considered a sphere of knowledge, wisdom, and truth on its own" challenged traditional understandings of religion's role and authority.[^65]

Al-Farabi's religious affiliation within Islam remains disputed among historians. While some identify him as Sunni, others assert he was Shia or influenced by Shia thought.[^66] Scholar Fauzi Najjar argues that al-Farabi's political philosophy was influenced by Shiite sects, adding another layer of controversy to his legacy.[^67]

Some scholars have criticized al-Farabi for providing philosophical rationale for controlling creative expression in the Muslim world, drawing on Platonic concepts to argue for censorship and restrictions on representation.[^68] This aspect of his political philosophy has been viewed as contributing to limitations on intellectual and artistic freedom.

New editions of his works and new translations have led to deeper studies of his thought and "some interesting and lively controversies" in contemporary scholarship, indicating that debates about interpreting his philosophy continue.[^69]

## Personal Life

Little reliable information exists about al-Farabi's personal life, as medieval Arab biographers had few facts to hand and often relied on invented stories.[^70] What is known is that he maintained a simple, ascetic lifestyle despite his association with the powerful and wealthy.[^71] Accounts from his time at the court of Sayf al-Dawla depict him as enjoying the ruler's esteem while declining lavish gifts and maintaining modest habits.[^72]

Al-Farabi never married and appears to have devoted his entire life to philosophical study and writing.[^73] He seems to have divided his later years between Damascus and Aleppo, where he interacted with the Hamdanid court while maintaining his scholarly independence.[^74] Contemporary sources describe him as preferring solitude for contemplation and study, embodying the philosophical ideal of the contemplative life he wrote about in his works.[^75]

Al-Farabi died in Damascus between December 14, 950, and January 12, 951 (Rajab 339 AH), at approximately 80 years of age.[^76] Al-Mas'udi, writing barely five years after the fact (955-956), confirms this timeline.[^77] Some accounts portray him dying naturally in Damascus, while at least one source holds that he was mugged and killed on the road from Damascus to Ascalon, though the former account is generally considered more reliable.[^78]

## Legacy

Al-Farabi's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, profoundly shaping both Islamic and Western intellectual traditions.

### Influence on Islamic Philosophy

Al-Farabi's impact on Islamic philosophy was transformative and enduring. His influence extended to major Islamic philosophers such as Yahya ibn Adi, Abu Sulayman Sijistani, Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri, Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi, Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Suhrawardi, Mulla Sadra, Avempace, Ibn Tufail, and Averroes (Ibn Rushd).[^79] His notion of religion and its place within "falsafa madaniyya" (civil philosophy) had tremendous impact on subsequent thinkers, particularly Ibn Bajja, Ibn Tufayl, and Ibn Rushd.[^80]

The story of his influence on Avicenna has become legendary: it is said that Avicenna read through Aristotle's Metaphysics forty times but found its meaning hopelessly obscure until he purchased a small commentary by al-Farabi at a bookstall for three dirhems, which suddenly illuminated Aristotle's meaning.[^81] Avicenna's two earliest works were written under al-Farabi's direct influence, and al-Farabi's doctrine of essence-existence became the basis for Avicenna's metaphysics.[^82] His influence was evident in Avicenna's explanation of emanation, the hierarchy of intellects, and the role assigned to the Tenth Intellect.[^83]

### Influence on Medieval Europe

Al-Farabi's impact extended to major thinkers of Christian medieval Europe, including Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, and Maimonides.[^84] His commentaries on Aristotle and original philosophical contributions were instrumental in the transmission of Greek philosophy to medieval Europe.[^85] Translation of his works from Arabic to Latin in Western Europe "led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world," according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.[^86] The influence of Islamic philosophers, particularly al-Farabi, was especially strong in natural philosophy, psychology, and metaphysics, though it also influenced logic and ethics.[^87]

Al-Farabi's and Gundisalvi's works were instrumental in disseminating a systematic division of the sciences throughout medieval Europe.[^88] His "Enumeration of the Sciences" had tremendous influence through its medieval Latin versions, shaping how European scholars understood the organization of knowledge.[^89]

### Enduring Recognition

Al-Farabi didn't merely preserve ancient wisdom; he transformed it into a dynamic intellectual tradition, ensuring that philosophy and logic became foundational pillars of education and scientific exploration in both the Islamic world and beyond.[^90] Philosophical cosmology, psychology, and politics were blended by al-Farabi into a political theology whose aim was to clarify the foundations of the Islamic community and defend its reform in a direction that would promote scientific inquiry and encourage philosophers to play an active role in practical affairs.[^91]

Beginning in the 1980s, much has happened in Farabian scholarship, with new and better editions of his works as well as new translations leading to deeper studies and lively scholarly controversies, demonstrating his continued relevance to contemporary philosophical inquiry.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars overwhelmingly recognize al-Farabi as one of the towering figures in the history of philosophy. He is frequently regarded by historians and commentators as the preeminent philosopher in the Islamic tradition.[^93] Majid Fakhry described al-Farabi as "the founder of Arab Neo-Platonism and the first major figure in the history of that philosophical movement since Proclus."[^94]

Al-Farabi's revolutionary refinements to Aristotelian logic created the framework that later giants like Avicenna would build upon.[^95] His systematic approach to philosophy established standards of rigor and comprehensiveness that subsequent philosophers strived to emulate. The honorific title "The Second Master" reflects the medieval Islamic world's assessment that only Aristotle surpassed him in philosophical authority.[^96]

His groundbreaking classification of sciences organized human knowledge in ways that remained influential for centuries.[^97] Scholars praise his ability to synthesize diverse philosophical traditions—Greek, Neoplatonic, and Islamic—into coherent systems that addressed the intellectual concerns of his era while establishing principles with enduring validity.[^98]

Al-Farabi's political philosophy is recognized as foundational, with scholars crediting him as the first to develop systematic political philosophy within the Islamic cultural tradition.[^99] His vision of the virtuous city and his integration of philosophical and prophetic wisdom established paradigms for thinking about governance, justice, and human flourishing that influenced political thought for centuries.[^100]

### Negative Views

Despite his monumental achievements, al-Farabi has faced persistent criticism from various quarters. Orthodox Islamic theologians, particularly al-Ghazali, challenged his philosophical approach as compromising core Islamic doctrines.[^101] The substitution of Neoplatonic emanation for Quranic creation ex nihilo was viewed as fundamentally incompatible with Islamic theology, leading some to question whether his philosophy could be reconciled with authentic Islamic faith.[^102]

Some modern scholars have criticized al-Farabi for providing philosophical justification for censorship and control of creative expression, arguing that his Platonic-inspired approach to managing poetic and artistic representation contributed to restrictions on intellectual freedom in the Muslim world.[^103] This criticism suggests that while al-Farabi advanced philosophical knowledge, some aspects of his political philosophy may have had negative consequences for cultural and artistic development.

Critics also point to ambiguities and tensions within al-Farabi's works. His account of religion as an instrument rather than a sphere of knowledge and truth has been criticized as diminishing religion's intrinsic value and reducing it to a mere tool for social control.[^104] Some scholars argue that this instrumentalist view of religion fails to appreciate its spiritual and existential dimensions.

The disputed question of al-Farabi's religious affiliation—whether Sunni, Shia, or influenced by various Islamic sects—has led some to question the orthodoxy of his Islamic credentials.[^105] These debates continue to generate scholarly controversy, with different interpreters reaching divergent conclusions about his relationship to Islamic theology and law.
