## Summary

Shinran was a Japanese Buddhist monk who founded Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land Buddhism), the largest Buddhist denomination in Japan. He radicalized his teacher Honen's Pure Land teachings by arguing that even a single sincere calling of Amida Buddha's name was sufficient for salvation. He broke with monastic tradition by marrying and having children. His theology of 'Other Power' (tariki) — total reliance on Amida's compassion — represents a unique development in Buddhist thought.
