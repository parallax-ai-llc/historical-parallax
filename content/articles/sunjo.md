## Summary

Sunjo (born July 29, 1790; died December 13, 1834) was the 23rd King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1800 to 1834.[^1] He ascended the throne at the young age of 10 after the sudden death of his father, King Jeongjo. His reign marks the beginning of the **Sedo Politics** (in-law government) era, a period of political decline where powerful aristocratic clans, notably the **Andong Kim clan**, monopolized state power, overshadowing the king.[^2] While Sunjo initially showed promise and goodness, his reign was plagued by corruption, natural disasters, and the massive **Hong Gyeong-nae Rebellion** (1811), which signaled the crumbling of the Joseon social order.[^3]

## Early Reign and Trusteeship

### The Boy King
Sunjo was the second son of King Jeongjo (his older brother died young). When Jeongjo died suddenly in 1800, Sunjo became king at age 10.
*   **Regency of Queen Jeongsun:** For the first three years (1800–1803), his step-great-grandmother, **Queen Jeongsun**, ruled as regent. She dismantled many of Jeongjo's reforms, persecuted Catholics (Sinyu Persecution of 1801), and purged the "Silhak" scholars favored by the late king.[^4]
*   **Marriage:** In 1802, Sunjo married Lady Kim (Queen Sunwon), the daughter of Kim Jo-sun, a powerful figure from the Andong Kim clan. This marriage planted the seeds for the clan's future dominance.[^5]

## The Era of Sedo Politics

After Queen Jeongsun's regency ended, Sunjo's father-in-law, **Kim Jo-sun**, helped purge the Queen's faction. However, instead of restoring royal authority, this consolidated power in the hands of the **Andong Kim clan**.
*   **In-Law Government:** The Andong Kim clan seized key government posts, controlling the military, personnel appointments, and taxation. The king was reduced to a rubber stamp.[^6]
*   **Corruption:** This concentration of power led to rampant corruption in the "Three Administrations" (Samjeong), burdening the peasantry with excessive taxes on land, military service, and state grain loans.

## Social Unrest and Rebellions

The corruption and mismanagement led to severe social unrest.
*   **Hong Gyeong-nae Rebellion (1811–1812):** A fallen yangban named **Hong Gyeong-nae** led a massive peasant uprising in the Pyongan Province (northwest). The rebels captured several districts, fueled by regional discrimination against northerners and anger over corruption. It took government troops five months to suppress the rebellion at the Siege of Jeongju Fortress.[^7]
*   **Disasters:** The era was also marked by frequent droughts and epidemics (cholera), which were interpreted by the people as signs of lost "Heaven's Mandate."

## Crown Prince Hyomyeong's Proxy Rule

In 1827, hoping to restore royal authority, King Sunjo authorized his 18-year-old son, **Crown Prince Hyomyeong**, to rule as a proxy regent.[^8]
*   **Reform Attempt:** The intelligent and capable Crown Prince attempted to check the Andong Kim clan by promoting the Pungyang Jo clan (his wife's family) and recruiting talented scholars.
*   **Tragedy:** However, the hope for reform was crushed when Crown Prince Hyomyeong died suddenly in 1830 at the age of 21. Sunjo was forced to resume rule, heartbroken and weakened.[^9]

## Death and Legacy

King Sunjo died on **December 13, 1834**, at the age of 44.
*   **Succeeded by Grandson:** With his son dead, Sunjo was succeeded by his 7-year-old grandson, **Heonjong**. This young succession further entrenched the power of the Andong Kim clan, continuing the dark age of Sedo Politics for another three decades.[^10]
