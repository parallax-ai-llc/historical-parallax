## Summary
Amelia Dyer was a Victorian-era English serial killer known as the most prolific baby farmer in British history. She murdered infants entrusted to her care over a 20-year period, possibly killing over 400 babies. She was hanged at Newgate Prison in 1896. Her case led to tighter adoption regulations.

## Early Life
Born in 1837 near Bristol, England. She trained as a nurse and began 'baby farming' — taking in unwanted infants for a fee — in the 1860s. She served a prison term for neglect in 1879. After release, she resumed the practice under different names across southern England. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Over approximately 20 years, Dyer took in babies from unmarried mothers or families unable to care for them, accepting lump sum payments. Rather than caring for the infants, she starved, drugged, or strangled them. She is believed to have murdered at least 200 and possibly over 400 infants. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
In March 1896, a bargeman found a baby's body in the River Thames wrapped in paper with Dyer's address. Police investigation revealed a pattern of infant deaths connected to her. She was arrested, tried, and convicted of one murder (though suspected of hundreds). She was hanged at Newgate Prison on June 10, 1896. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Her case led to the Infant Life Protection Act of 1897 [^4]
- Prompted tighter regulation of adoption and foster care
- Highlighted the desperate situation of unmarried mothers in Victorian England

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered possibly hundreds of infants over 20 years [^5]
- Took payment to care for babies, then killed them
- Operated under multiple aliases to avoid detection
- Targeted the most helpless victims — newborn babies
- Exploited the shame and desperation of unmarried mothers
