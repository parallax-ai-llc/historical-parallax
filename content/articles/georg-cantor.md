## Summary

Georg Cantor was a German mathematician who created set theory, which became a fundamental theory in mathematics. He proved that infinite sets can have different sizes (cardinalities) and introduced the concept of transfinite numbers. His work on the nature of infinity was revolutionary but controversial during his lifetime. Cantor suffered from mental health issues partly exacerbated by the opposition his ideas faced.
