## Summary

Patanjali was an ancient Indian sage who compiled the Yoga Sutras, the foundational text of Raja Yoga and one of the most influential philosophical works in Hindu tradition. His systematic presentation of yoga as an eight-limbed path (ashtanga yoga) — from ethical disciplines to meditation and samadhi — defined the practice for centuries. He is also traditionally credited with writing a major commentary on Panini's Sanskrit grammar. The Yoga Sutras remain the most authoritative text on yoga philosophy.
