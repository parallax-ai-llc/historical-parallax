## Summary

Al-Tabari was a Persian scholar who produced two of the most important works in Islamic literature: his monumental history (Tarikh al-Rusul wa-l-Muluk) and his comprehensive Quran commentary (Tafsir al-Tabari). His history covers world events from creation to his own time. His tafsir remains one of the most authoritative Quran commentaries. He also founded his own short-lived school of jurisprudence.
