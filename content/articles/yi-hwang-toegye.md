## Summary

Yi Hwang (1501-1570), better known by his pen name Toegye, stands as one of Korea's most influential Neo-Confucian scholars and philosophers of the Joseon Dynasty. His profound contributions to Korean Confucian thought, particularly his theories on the Four-Seven Debate concerning human nature and emotions, shaped Korean intellectual life for centuries. Depicted on the modern South Korean 1,000 won banknote, Yi Hwang's legacy extends beyond philosophy to education, having established the Dosan Seowon academy that became a model for Confucian learning. His writings, particularly the *Seonghak Sipdo* (Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning), influenced not only Korean thought but also Japanese Neo-Confucianism during the Edo period. Yi Hwang's emphasis on moral self-cultivation and his synthesis of Chinese Neo-Confucian philosophy with Korean intellectual traditions established him as Korea's most revered Confucian thinker.

## Early Life and Background

Yi Hwang was born on November 25, 1501, in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, into a yangban (aristocratic) family of modest means. His father, Yi Sik, died when Yi Hwang was only seven months old, leaving his mother, Lady Park, to raise him and his siblings in difficult circumstances. Despite their poverty, Lady Park was determined to provide her children with proper education, reflecting the yangban class's commitment to scholarship even in hardship. This early loss profoundly shaped Yi Hwang's character, instilling in him both resilience and a deep appreciation for maternal devotion that would later influence his teachings on filial piety.[^1]

Yi Hwang's intellectual gifts became apparent early in his childhood. He began his classical education at age twelve under his uncle Yi U, studying the Confucian classics and Chinese historical texts. By age thirteen, he had already composed poetry that demonstrated remarkable sophistication, and at twenty, he began studying the works of Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, whose thought would become the foundation of his own philosophical system. His early education took place during a period of intense factional strife in Joseon politics, which would later influence his decision to prioritize scholarship over political ambition.[^2]

The young scholar passed the lower-level civil service examination (saengwon-si) in 1527 at age 27, a relatively late age that reflected both his family's financial constraints and his perfectionist approach to learning. He married at age 20 to Lady Gwon, who died childless after just one year of marriage. He remarried to Lady An, with whom he had two sons. His family responsibilities and his mother's expectations initially pulled him toward government service, but his heart was increasingly drawn to philosophical inquiry and teaching.[^3]

Yi Hwang's formative years coincided with the reign of King Jungjong, a period marked by factional conflicts between the reformist Sarim ("Forest of Scholars") faction and the established Hungu ("Meritorious Elite") faction. The Sarim advocated for strict adherence to Confucian principles in governance and opposed the pragmatic compromises of the Hungu. These political-philosophical tensions would frame Yi Hwang's entire career, as he aligned himself with Sarim ideals while attempting to remain above factional politics.[^4]

## Rise to Prominence

Yi Hwang's path to prominence was neither rapid nor linear, marked by his repeated attempts to balance scholarly pursuits with the obligations of government service. He passed the higher-level civil service examination (munkwa) in 1534 at age 34, finally entering government service. However, his bureaucratic career was characterized by frequent resignations and retreats to his hometown, reflecting his genuine preference for study and teaching over political maneuvering. This pattern of reluctant service actually enhanced his reputation as a principled scholar uncorrupted by political ambition.[^5]

During his intermittent government service from the 1530s through the 1550s, Yi Hwang held various positions including appointments at the Hongmungwan (Office of Special Advisors), Yemungwan (Office of Royal Decrees), and Seonggyungwan (National Confucian Academy). In these roles, he gained a reputation for directness and moral courage, particularly in his willingness to criticize royal policies that he viewed as violating Confucian principles. His memorials to the throne emphasized proper ritual observance, education, and moral governance, themes that would dominate his later philosophical writings.[^6]

The turning point in Yi Hwang's intellectual prominence came with his engagement in the famous Four-Seven Debate (1559-1566) with fellow scholar Gi Daeseung. This debate concerned the relationship between the "Four Beginnings" (Confucian virtues arising from moral nature) and the "Seven Emotions" (natural human feelings). Yi Hwang argued that the Four Beginnings issued from li (principle/reason) while the Seven Emotions issued from qi (material force/vital energy), establishing a dualistic framework that emphasized the possibility of pure moral motivation. This sophisticated metaphysical discussion, conducted through letters and treatises, established Yi Hwang as the foremost Neo-Confucian thinker of his generation.[^7]

Yi Hwang's reputation was further solidified by his teaching activities. Even while serving in government, he maintained students and conducted informal academies. His pedagogical approach emphasized gradual moral self-cultivation through study, reflection, and practice. He stressed the importance of jing (reverence/mindfulness) and the investigation of principle in daily life, making abstract Neo-Confucian concepts accessible to students. His ability to translate complex Chinese Neo-Confucian thought into the Korean context made him invaluable to a generation seeking to root Confucian learning in Korean soil.[^8]

In 1549, at age 49, Yi Hwang made his most determined effort to retire from government service, finally gaining permission after years of requests. He returned to Andong and began establishing what would become his greatest institutional legacy: the Dosan Seowon academy. Founded in 1561, this academy became the model for Confucian education in Korea, combining rigorous classical study with moral cultivation and practical learning. The academy's establishment marked Yi Hwang's transition from reluctant official to full-time scholar-teacher, the role in which he would make his most lasting contributions.[^9]

## Major Achievements

Yi Hwang's most significant achievement lies in his systematic development of Neo-Confucian philosophy adapted to the Korean intellectual context. His magnum opus, *Seonghak Sipdo* (Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning), completed in 1568, synthesized the entire Neo-Confucian philosophical tradition into an accessible visual and textual format. The work presented ten diagrams explaining cosmology, human nature, moral cultivation, and the path to sagehood, each accompanied by detailed commentary drawing on Chinese masters while incorporating Yi Hwang's own insights. This work became the standard introduction to Neo-Confucian thought in Korea and was extensively studied in Japan during the Edo period.[^10]

His contribution to the Four-Seven Debate represents a landmark in East Asian philosophy. Yi Hwang's position that the Four Beginnings (commiseration, shame, modesty, and moral discrimination) arose directly from li (principle) while the Seven Emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, desire) arose from qi (material force) established what became known as the "mainstream" position in Korean Neo-Confucianism. This framework provided a metaphysical foundation for believing in innate human goodness and the possibility of moral perfection through self-cultivation. While later scholars like Yi I (Yulgok) challenged aspects of this formulation, Yi Hwang's framework dominated Korean Confucian thought for centuries.[^11]

Yi Hwang produced a vast corpus of writings including poetry, letters, memorials, and philosophical treatises. His collected works, *Toegye Jip*, comprise over 100 volumes covering topics from metaphysics to practical ethics, from ritual propriety to political theory. His correspondence alone fills numerous volumes and provides invaluable insights into Joseon intellectual life. His poetic works, numbering over 1,000 poems, are celebrated for their philosophical depth and aesthetic refinement, demonstrating that for Yi Hwang, poetry was not mere entertainment but a vehicle for expressing moral and metaphysical truths.[^12]

The establishment and development of Dosan Seowon academy represents Yi Hwang's practical educational legacy. Unlike state-sponsored institutions focused on examination preparation, Dosan Seowon emphasized genuine learning and moral cultivation. The academy's curriculum centered on close reading of Confucian classics, discussion of moral and philosophical problems, and cultivation of proper ritual behavior. Yi Hwang personally designed the academy's physical layout to reflect Neo-Confucian cosmological principles, with the study hall positioned to face the river, symbolizing the scholar's need for both stability and adaptability. After his death, the academy became a pilgrimage site for scholars throughout East Asia.[^13]

Yi Hwang's influence extended to Japan through his writings, particularly the *Seonghak Sipdo*. Japanese scholars during the Edo period eagerly studied his works, with figures like Yamazaki Ansai and Nakae Tōju drawing heavily on his interpretations of Neo-Confucianism. The Tosa school of Neo-Confucianism in Japan was particularly influenced by Yi Hwang's emphasis on reverence and moral cultivation. This cross-cultural influence established Yi Hwang as one of the few Korean thinkers whose impact extended beyond Korea's borders, demonstrating the universality of his philosophical insights.[^14]

His advocacy for the Sarim faction's political philosophy, emphasizing moral governance over pragmatic compromise, helped establish the ideological framework that would dominate Joseon politics for the next three centuries. While this had both positive and negative consequences, Yi Hwang's insistence that political legitimacy derived from moral integrity rather than mere effectiveness established a principled foundation for political discourse. His memorials to the throne consistently emphasized the ruler's obligation to moral self-cultivation as the foundation of good governance, a theme that resonated throughout the Confucian world.[^15]

Yi Hwang's commentaries on the Chinese classics, particularly his interpretations of Zhu Xi's works, became standard references in Korean Confucian education. His ability to clarify difficult passages and resolve apparent contradictions in Neo-Confucian texts made these works accessible to generations of Korean students. His *Zhu Zi Shu Jie Ti Yao* (Essentials of Zhu Xi's Letters) organized and systematized Zhu Xi's voluminous correspondence into a coherent philosophical framework, a work that even Chinese scholars consulted.[^16]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his venerated status, Yi Hwang's philosophical positions attracted significant criticism both during his lifetime and subsequently. His contemporary Yi I (Yulgok, 1536-1584) challenged Yi Hwang's dualistic interpretation of the Four-Seven relationship, arguing that both the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions arose from the same source—the interaction of li and qi—and that Yi Hwang's formulation created an artificial and metaphysically problematic separation. Yi I argued that li cannot "issue" or act independently, as it is purely formal principle, while qi provides the material basis for all phenomena. This critique initiated the Horak Debate that divided Korean Confucians for generations, with some scholars viewing Yi Hwang's position as philosophically incoherent.[^17]

Critics have argued that Yi Hwang's emphasis on metaphysical speculation and moral idealism contributed to an impractical orientation in Korean Confucianism that hindered Korea's adaptation to changing historical circumstances. His prioritization of self-cultivation and theoretical understanding over practical statecraft and technical learning arguably contributed to the intellectual rigidity that left Korea unprepared for encounters with Western imperialism in the nineteenth century. Some modern Korean scholars have suggested that the dominance of Yi Hwang's idealistic Neo-Confucianism diverted intellectual energy away from practical sciences and empirical investigation.[^18]

Yi Hwang's repeated withdrawals from government service, while enhancing his reputation for principle, also meant that he had limited practical impact on governance during a period when Korea faced significant challenges. During his lifetime, Korea experienced Japanese pirate raids (waegu), internal factional conflicts, and economic difficulties. Critics suggest that a scholar of Yi Hwang's stature might have served his country better by remaining in government and applying his principles to practical administration rather than retreating to philosophical contemplation. His model of the scholar-recluse, while admirable in Confucian terms, may have encouraged later generations to prioritize personal moral purity over engaged public service.[^19]

Some historians have noted that Yi Hwang's alignment with the Sarim faction, despite his attempts to remain above factional politics, contributed to the intensification of factional conflicts that plagued the Joseon Dynasty. His philosophical authority was claimed by various Sarim sub-factions, particularly the Yeongnam school centered in his home region, which used his teachings to legitimize their political positions. The factional violence that characterized later Joseon politics, including purges and executions, was sometimes justified through competing interpretations of Yi Hwang's principles, a consequence he could not have anticipated but which complicates his legacy.[^20]

Yi Hwang's educational philosophy, while emphasizing moral development, has been criticized for its elitism and impracticality for the majority of the population. His curriculum presumed extensive leisure time for study and reflection, possible only for the yangban class. The Dosan Seowon model, while intellectually sophisticated, reinforced class hierarchies and did little to address the educational needs of commoners. Modern critics argue that this educational approach, focused on cultivating a small elite rather than broader literacy, contributed to social rigidity and limited social mobility in the Joseon Dynasty.[^21]

His strict interpretation of Confucian ritual propriety has been viewed by some as excessively rigid, contributing to what some modern scholars characterize as the ossification of Korean culture. His insistence on precise observance of mourning rites, ancestral ceremonies, and hierarchical protocols created social pressures that could be oppressive, particularly for women and lower-status individuals. The elaborate ritual codes that dominated Joseon society were partly legitimized by scholars like Yi Hwang, whose philosophical authority made questioning these practices tantamount to heterodoxy.[^22]

---

## Personal Life

Yi Hwang's personal life was marked by both tragedy and devotion to family. His first wife, Lady Gwon, died after only one year of marriage, a loss that deeply affected him. He remarried to Lady An, with whom he had two sons: Yi Jun and Yi Jeong. His relationship with his mother, Lady Park, profoundly influenced his character and teachings. She lived to age 71, and Yi Hwang served her with exemplary filial devotion, frequently mentioning her in his writings as a model of virtue and sacrifice. When she died in 1548, Yi Hwang observed the traditional three-year mourning period with extreme rigor, an experience that deepened his understanding of Confucian ritual and grief.[^23]

His personality, as revealed through his correspondence and contemporary accounts, combined intellectual brilliance with genuine humility. Unlike some scholars who cultivated a public persona of otherworldly detachment, Yi Hwang showed real warmth in his relationships with students and friends. His letters reveal a man capable of humor, self-deprecation, and genuine concern for others' well-being. He was known for his patience in teaching, willing to explain difficult concepts repeatedly until students understood. This pedagogical generosity attracted hundreds of disciples during his lifetime and contributed to his posthumous reputation as the ideal teacher.[^24]

Yi Hwang suffered from chronic health problems throughout his adult life, including digestive issues and general weakness. These ailments partly motivated his repeated requests to resign from government service, though they did not prevent him from maintaining a rigorous schedule of study, writing, and teaching. He practiced what he called "quiet sitting" (jing-zuo), a meditative practice intended to cultivate reverence and calm the mind, which he believed helped manage his physical ailments and maintain mental clarity. This practice became central to his pedagogical method and was passed down to his disciples.[^25]

His lifestyle at Dosan reflected his philosophical principles. He lived simply, eschewing luxuries available to someone of his status. His study and living quarters were modest, designed to minimize distraction and promote focused contemplation. He maintained a garden that served both aesthetic and philosophical purposes, viewing the cultivation of plants as analogous to the cultivation of virtue. His daily routine combined study, teaching, correspondence, and reflection, exemplifying the life of self-cultivation he advocated in his philosophical writings.[^26]

Yi Hwang's relationship with his students was characterized by genuine affection combined with high expectations. He maintained correspondence with students long after they left Dosan Seowon, offering guidance on both philosophical problems and practical life challenges. His letters to students reveal a mentor deeply invested in their moral and intellectual development, celebrating their successes and offering gentle correction of their errors. This network of students and disciples became the Yeongnam school of Neo-Confucianism, which dominated southeastern Korea and claimed Yi Hwang's intellectual legacy.[^27]

In his final years, Yi Hwang experienced a period of intense productivity, completing his *Seonghak Sipdo* and other major works while also conducting regular teaching sessions. He maintained his intellectual vigor despite declining physical health, continuing to engage in philosophical correspondence and debate until shortly before his death. When he sensed his approaching death in December 1570, he reportedly gathered his students, offered final instructions on maintaining their studies and moral cultivation, and died peacefully at age 70. His death was mourned throughout Korea, and the king bestowed posthumous honors recognizing his contributions to Korean learning.[^28]

## Legacy

Yi Hwang's legacy in Korea is difficult to overstate. He became the definitive figure of Korean Neo-Confucianism, with his interpretations considered orthodox by the Joseon court and scholarly establishment. The Dosan Seowon academy he founded became one of the most prestigious educational institutions in Korea, and his descendants and disciples formed an influential intellectual network that shaped Korean thought for centuries. His tomb in Andong became a pilgrimage site, and his birthday is still commemorated by Confucian organizations in South Korea. His appearance on the 1,000 won note, first issued in 1975, symbolizes his status as a national cultural icon.[^29]

The Yeongnam school of Neo-Confucianism, centered in Gyeongsang Province and claiming Yi Hwang as its founder, became one of the most powerful intellectual and political factions in late Joseon Korea. This school maintained Yi Hwang's emphasis on the primacy of li (principle) and the possibility of moral perfection through self-cultivation. The philosophical debates between the Yeongnam school and the Giho school (following Yi I) dominated Korean Confucian discourse through the nineteenth century, with each school producing voluminous commentaries defending their founder's positions. These debates, while sometimes excessively scholastic, maintained a high level of philosophical sophistication in Korean intellectual life.[^30]

Yi Hwang's educational philosophy profoundly influenced the development of the seowon system in Korea. At its height in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, hundreds of private Confucian academies modeled on Dosan Seowon operated throughout Korea, each claiming to follow Yi Hwang's pedagogical principles. While the government eventually restricted seowon growth due to their involvement in factional politics, the model of combining classical study, moral cultivation, and commemoration of past sages remained Yi Hwang's enduring contribution to Korean education. The Dosan Seowon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2019 as part of the "Seowon, Korean Neo-Confucian Academies" inscription.[^31]

His influence extended to Japan in profound ways. During the Edo period (1603-1868), Japanese scholars eagerly studied Yi Hwang's works, particularly the *Seonghak Sipdo*, which was repeatedly printed in Japan. Confucian scholars like Yamazaki Ansai incorporated Yi Hwang's interpretations into Japanese Neo-Confucian thought, and the Tosa school in particular claimed Yi Hwang as a major influence. This cross-cultural intellectual exchange demonstrated that Yi Hwang's thought transcended national boundaries, contributing to broader East Asian intellectual traditions. Some Japanese scholars even made pilgrimages to Dosan Seowon to pay respects to Yi Hwang's memory.[^32]

Modern Korean nationalism has embraced Yi Hwang as a symbol of Korean cultural achievement and intellectual independence. During the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), Korean intellectuals highlighted Yi Hwang as evidence of Korea's sophisticated philosophical tradition, countering Japanese claims of Korean cultural inferiority. After liberation, both North and South Korea claimed Yi Hwang's legacy, though South Korea has been more active in commemorating him. The establishment of Yeungnam University and the Toegye Studies Institute has ensured continued scholarly attention to his life and works.[^33]

Yi Hwang's writings continue to be studied not merely as historical artifacts but as living philosophical texts. Contemporary Korean philosophers engage with his interpretations of human nature, emotion, and moral cultivation, finding relevance in his discussions of how to maintain moral integrity in complex social circumstances. His emphasis on self-reflection, mindfulness, and gradual moral improvement has found resonance in contemporary discussions of character education and virtue ethics. Some scholars have drawn parallels between Yi Hwang's concept of reverence (jing) and mindfulness practices in Buddhist and contemporary psychological traditions.[^34]

The Toegye Studies Institute, established in 1970, has systematically published critical editions of Yi Hwang's complete works, translations into modern Korean and foreign languages, and scholarly studies of his philosophy. This institutional support has ensured that Yi Hwang's legacy remains accessible to new generations. International conferences on Yi Hwang's thought have brought together scholars from Korea, Japan, China, and the West, demonstrating the ongoing international interest in his contributions to philosophy and education.[^35]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessments of Yi Hwang overwhelmingly emphasize his role as Korea's greatest systematic philosopher and his contributions to developing a distinctively Korean approach to Neo-Confucianism. Historian Martina Deuchler describes Yi Hwang as the figure who "transformed imported Chinese philosophy into a Korean intellectual tradition," noting that his ability to synthesize and systematize Neo-Confucian thought made it accessible and applicable to Korean society. His emphasis on moral cultivation and the primacy of principle provided a philosophical foundation for Joseon Dynasty culture that emphasized ethical governance and social harmony.[^36]

Modern Korean philosophers like Koh Byong-ik have praised Yi Hwang's sophisticated handling of the relationship between principle (li) and material force (qi), arguing that his formulation, while contested, represented a genuine advancement in East Asian metaphysics. Koh argues that Yi Hwang's position that principle could serve as the primary source of the Four Beginnings provided a robust foundation for moral education and self-cultivation, establishing that human beings possess innate moral capacities that can be developed through proper education and effort. This optimistic view of human nature, grounded in metaphysical theory, distinguished Yi Hwang's thought from more pessimistic alternatives.[^37]

Educational theorists have consistently praised Yi Hwang's pedagogical philosophy and practice. Mark Setton, in his study of Joseon education, argues that Yi Hwang "created the model of the teacher-scholar that dominated Korean education for centuries," combining rigorous intellectual standards with genuine care for students' moral and personal development. The Dosan Seowon model, emphasizing small class sizes, close teacher-student relationships, and integration of study with daily life, represented an educational ideal that contrasted sharply with the examination-focused memorization dominant in state institutions.[^38]

Yi Hwang's emphasis on practical moral cultivation rather than mere theoretical knowledge has earned praise from scholars concerned with applied ethics. His insistence that philosophy must transform the individual, not merely provide intellectual sophistication, established a standard that later Korean Neo-Confucians struggled to maintain. His concept of reverence (jing) as a daily practice of mindfulness and moral attention has been particularly praised as a practical method for character development. Contemporary virtue ethicists have found in Yi Hwang's work a systematic approach to moral self-cultivation that parallels Western Aristotelian traditions while offering distinctive insights.[^39]

Art historians and literary scholars celebrate Yi Hwang's poetry as among the finest produced during the Joseon Dynasty. His poems combine philosophical depth with aesthetic refinement, using natural imagery to express moral and metaphysical concepts. Scholar Kim Un-jong argues that Yi Hwang "demonstrated that philosophical profundity and poetic beauty are complementary rather than contradictory," creating works that functioned simultaneously as artistic achievements and vehicles for moral instruction. His poetry influenced generations of Korean literati who sought to emulate his integration of learning and artistry.[^40]

Comparative philosophers have highlighted Yi Hwang's contributions to broader East Asian intellectual history. Huang Chun-chieh notes that Yi Hwang's reinterpretation of Zhu Xi's thought demonstrated that Confucianism was not a static orthodoxy but a living tradition capable of development and adaptation. Yi Hwang's willingness to modify and extend Zhu Xi's positions while maintaining fidelity to core principles exemplified the creative appropriation of tradition that characterized the best of East Asian philosophy. His work provided a model for how later scholars could remain within tradition while developing new insights.[^41]

### Negative Views

Critics of Yi Hwang have focused on what they view as the excessive abstraction and impracticality of his philosophical approach. Historian James Palais argues that Yi Hwang's emphasis on metaphysical speculation and moral idealism "diverted Korean intellectual energy away from practical statecraft and technical learning at precisely the time when such knowledge was becoming crucial." Palais contends that the dominance of Yi Hwang's approach contributed to Korea's unpreparedness for the challenges of the late nineteenth century, when Korea faced Western imperialism and needed practical rather than purely moral responses.[^42]

Scholars in the Yi I (Yulgok) tradition have consistently criticized Yi Hwang's Four-Seven theory as metaphysically incoherent. Han Woong-jin argues that Yi Hwang's claim that principle (li) can "issue" or act independently contradicts the fundamental Neo-Confucian position that li is purely formal and cannot initiate action. This criticism suggests that Yi Hwang, in his eagerness to establish the primacy of moral principle, created philosophical problems that subsequent generations struggled unsuccessfully to resolve. The resulting debates, while intellectually sophisticated, may have been based on a fundamental conceptual confusion.[^43]

Modern Korean critics have argued that Yi Hwang's philosophy, with its emphasis on hierarchy, ritual propriety, and class distinctions, reinforced oppressive social structures. Feminist scholars like Chai-sik Chung note that Yi Hwang's writings consistently assume and reinforce patriarchal family structures and the subordination of women, providing philosophical justification for practices that restricted women's autonomy and opportunities. While Yi Hwang might be excused as a product of his time, the continuing veneration of his thought can obscure its role in legitimizing gender inequality.[^44]

Some historians have criticized Yi Hwang's political legacy, arguing that his withdrawal from active governance and his emphasis on personal moral cultivation over institutional reform contributed to the Joseon Dynasty's political dysfunction. While Yi Hwang is celebrated for his principled refusal to compromise with factional politics, critics suggest this stance represented a form of political irresponsibility. A scholar of his stature might have worked to reform institutions and reduce factional conflict rather than retreating to philosophical contemplation, however admirable such contemplation might be.[^45]

Educational critics have argued that the Dosan Seowon model, while intellectually sophisticated, was inherently elitist and contributed to social stratification. By focusing on cultivating a small number of yangban scholars in classical learning, Yi Hwang's educational approach neglected the needs of the broader population. The proliferation of seowon following Yi Hwang's model, combined with their tax exemptions and factional affiliations, eventually became a social problem that the Joseon court struggled to manage. The Daewongun's closure of most seowon in 1871 represented official recognition that Yi Hwang's educational legacy had produced problematic institutional consequences.[^46]

Modernist critics have argued that the veneration of Yi Hwang and the dominance of his philosophical approach contributed to Korean intellectual conservatism and resistance to needed reforms. The tendency to resolve philosophical and practical problems by appealing to Yi Hwang's authority, rather than through independent critical inquiry, arguably stifled intellectual innovation. While Yi Hwang himself was a creative and independent thinker, the transformation of his work into unquestionable orthodoxy may have prevented the kind of critical engagement necessary for intellectual progress.[^47]

Some comparative philosophers have questioned whether Yi Hwang's contributions warrant the exceptional reverence he receives in Korea. While acknowledging his abilities, these scholars suggest that Yi Hwang's thought represents competent engagement with Neo-Confucian themes rather than revolutionary innovation. His contemporary Yi I, while less celebrated in popular culture, may have developed more philosophically sophisticated positions. The elevation of Yi Hwang to unparalleled status may owe more to political and regional factors—his association with the Sarim faction and the Yeongnam region—than to purely philosophical considerations.[^48]
