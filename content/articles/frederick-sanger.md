## Summary

Frederick Sanger was a British biochemist who achieved the extraordinary distinction of being one of only five individuals to win two Nobel Prizes, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice. His pioneering work in determining the amino acid sequence of insulin revolutionized our understanding of protein structure, while his development of DNA sequencing methods laid the foundation for modern genomics and the Human Genome Project. Despite his towering achievements in science, Sanger remained remarkably modest and dedicated to laboratory work rather than seeking fame or administrative positions. His methodologies transformed biology from a descriptive science into a molecular one, enabling countless medical and scientific breakthroughs that continue to benefit humanity today.

## Early Life and Background

Frederick Sanger was born on August 13, 1918, in Rendcombe, a small village in Gloucestershire, England, into a prosperous Quaker family.[^1] His father, Frederick Sanger Sr., was a medical practitioner who had converted to Quakerism, a faith that would deeply influence young Frederick's values of modesty, pacifism, and dedication to humanitarian service.[^2] The Quaker tradition emphasized simplicity, integrity, and the importance of education, principles that would characterize Sanger's entire scientific career.

Growing up in a comfortable middle-class household, Sanger received his early education at the Downs School, a Quaker boarding school in Worcestershire.[^3] The school's emphasis on independent thinking and moral responsibility helped shape his character. His interest in science emerged during his teenage years at Bryanston School in Dorset, where he was exposed to chemistry and biology, though he later recalled that he was not a particularly outstanding student in his youth.[^4]

In 1936, Sanger entered St John's College, Cambridge, initially intending to study medicine like his father.[^5] However, he soon found himself more captivated by the emerging field of biochemistry, which was beginning to apply chemical principles to understand living organisms at a molecular level. The intellectual environment at Cambridge, with its rich tradition in the physical sciences and biology, proved transformative for the young student. He was also influenced by his Quaker pacifist beliefs, which made him uncomfortable with the idea of practicing medicine during a time when war seemed increasingly inevitable.[^6]

Sanger completed his Bachelor's degree in natural sciences in 1939, just as World War II began.[^7] As a conscientious objector due to his Quaker beliefs, he was exempted from military service and instead pursued graduate studies in biochemistry, working on lysine metabolism under Albert Neuberger.[^8] This decision to continue his scientific education during wartime would prove fortuitous, as it kept him engaged in research at a critical period in the development of biochemistry. He earned his PhD in 1943 with a thesis on the metabolism of the amino acid lysine, work that provided him with fundamental skills in amino acid chemistry that would prove invaluable in his future research.[^9]

## Rise to Prominence

Sanger's rise to scientific prominence began shortly after completing his doctoral degree when he joined the laboratory of A.C. Chibnall at Cambridge in 1944.[^10] Chibnall had recently become interested in determining the chemical structure of proteins, which were known to be composed of amino acids but whose exact sequences remained a mystery. This was considered one of the great unsolved problems in biochemistry, with many scientists believing that determining the precise order of amino acids in a protein might be impossible.[^11]

Chibnall suggested that Sanger work on insulin, a protein hormone that had been discovered in 1921 and was already being used to treat diabetes.[^12] Insulin was an ideal target because it was readily available in pure form, relatively small (as proteins go), and medically important. Sanger approached the problem with characteristic methodological rigor, developing chemical techniques to identify the amino acids at the ends of protein chains.[^13] His breakthrough came with the development of what became known as "Sanger's reagent" (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene), a chemical that could label the free amino groups of amino acids, allowing him to identify them after breaking down the protein.[^14]

Working with painstaking care over nearly a decade, Sanger and his small team gradually pieced together the complete amino acid sequence of insulin.[^15] In 1951, he published a paper showing that insulin consisted of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bridges, and by 1955, he had determined the complete sequence of all 51 amino acids in bovine insulin.[^16] This work definitively proved that proteins had specific, determinable structures—they were not random mixtures of amino acids as some had theorized, but precisely ordered molecules encoded by genetic information.[^17]

The impact of this achievement cannot be overstated. Sanger's sequencing of insulin established that proteins had definite structures that could be determined by chemical methods, opening the door to understanding how protein structure relates to function.[^18] It also provided crucial evidence for the emerging understanding of how genetic information is stored and expressed. In recognition of this monumental achievement, Sanger was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958, at the age of 40.[^19]

Rather than resting on his laurels, Sanger immediately embarked on a new challenge: developing methods to sequence nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), the molecules that carry genetic information.[^20] By the early 1960s, he had shifted his focus to RNA sequencing, developing techniques that allowed him to determine the sequence of small RNA molecules.[^21] This work laid important groundwork, but the real breakthrough came in the 1970s when he turned his attention to DNA sequencing, a far more challenging problem due to the length and complexity of DNA molecules.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Frederick Sanger's scientific achievements fundamentally transformed the field of molecular biology and earned him a unique place in the history of science. His first major achievement, the sequencing of insulin, not only won him his first Nobel Prize but established the entire field of protein chemistry.[^23] By proving that proteins had specific, determinable sequences, Sanger's work validated the central dogma of molecular biology—that DNA encodes RNA, which encodes proteins—and provided a method for investigating the structure-function relationships that govern all biological processes.[^24]

The methodology Sanger developed for protein sequencing, involving chemical degradation and chromatographic analysis, became the standard approach for determining protein sequences for decades.[^25] His work on insulin also had immediate medical implications, as understanding the structure of insulin enabled researchers to study how variations in the molecule affected its function, ultimately leading to the development of synthetic and modified insulins for diabetes treatment.[^26] The proof that a biologically active protein could be completely characterized at the molecular level inspired an entire generation of biochemists to tackle similar problems with other proteins.

Sanger's second major achievement came in the 1970s with his development of DNA sequencing methods. In 1977, he published a paper describing the "dideoxy method" or "Sanger sequencing," a technique that allowed researchers to determine the sequence of DNA molecules rapidly and accurately.[^27] This method used modified nucleotides (dideoxynucleotides) that terminated DNA synthesis at specific points, creating fragments of different lengths that could be separated and read to determine the sequence.[^28] The elegance and efficiency of Sanger sequencing made it immediately practical for laboratories around the world.

The impact of Sanger sequencing was revolutionary. In the same year he published his method, Sanger used it to sequence the entire genome of bacteriophage φX174, a virus with 5,386 nucleotides—the first complete DNA genome ever sequenced.[^29] This demonstrated that whole genomes could be sequenced, not just individual genes, opening up entirely new possibilities for biological research. The method proved so powerful and reliable that it remained the dominant DNA sequencing technology for over three decades and was the primary method used in the Human Genome Project.[^30]

For his development of DNA sequencing methods, Sanger received his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980, shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg.[^31] This made him only the fourth person ever to win two Nobel Prizes, and the only person to win the Chemistry prize twice. The Nobel Committee recognized that his work had "laid the foundation for our current knowledge concerning the chemistry of heredity and for all the different applications that this knowledge has found in medicine and other fields."[^32]

Beyond these two Nobel Prize-winning achievements, Sanger made numerous other important contributions. His work on the structure of RNA and the sequencing of transfer RNA molecules advanced understanding of protein synthesis.[^33] He also sequenced human mitochondrial DNA in 1981, providing insights into cellular evolution and mitochondrial diseases.[^34] Throughout his career, Sanger published over 150 scientific papers, many of which became foundational texts in biochemistry and molecular biology.[^35]

Perhaps equally important was Sanger's role in training the next generation of scientists. His laboratory at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge became a world-renowned center for molecular biology research.[^36] Many of his students and postdoctoral researchers went on to become leading scientists in their own right, spreading his methodological rigor and innovative approaches throughout the scientific community.[^37] The culture of excellence and collaboration he fostered contributed to the LMB becoming one of the most productive research institutions in the world, with numerous Nobel Prizes awarded to its scientists.[^38]

Sanger's techniques also had profound practical applications beyond pure research. DNA sequencing has become fundamental to medicine, forensics, agriculture, environmental science, and numerous other fields.[^39] Modern personalized medicine, which tailors treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup, would be impossible without the sequencing technologies that descended from Sanger's work.[^40] The ability to rapidly sequence pathogens has transformed public health responses to infectious diseases, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic.[^41] Forensic DNA analysis has revolutionized criminal justice, while agricultural applications have enabled the development of improved crop varieties.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many prominent scientists, Frederick Sanger's career was remarkably free from major controversies or ethical scandals. His personal modesty, integrity, and focus on rigorous science earned him nearly universal respect in the scientific community.[^43] However, this does not mean his work and legacy are without points of criticism or debate, particularly when viewed through contemporary lenses.

One area of subtle criticism concerns the slow pace of his work, particularly on insulin sequencing. The project took nearly a decade to complete, and some contemporaries questioned whether such painstaking, methodical research represented the most efficient use of resources and talent.[^44] In the competitive, rapidly moving field of biochemistry in the 1950s, some felt that Sanger's approach was overly cautious and that faster progress might have been made with different methodologies or more aggressive risk-taking.[^45] However, history has vindicated Sanger's careful approach—his results were definitive and his methods became standard precisely because of their reliability and reproducibility.

From a modern perspective, some historians of science have noted that Sanger's work, like much mid-20th century biochemistry, involved extensive use of animal tissues and insulin derived from animal sources, raising questions about animal welfare that were not prominent concerns during his era.[^46] While Sanger himself worked primarily with already-extracted and purified materials, the broader research program that his work enabled did involve significant animal experimentation. Contemporary ethical frameworks would demand more rigorous animal welfare considerations than were standard during Sanger's working years.[^47]

Another area of discussion concerns issues of credit and collaboration. While Sanger was scrupulous in acknowledging his colleagues and collaborators, some historical analyses have suggested that the contributions of his technical assistants and junior researchers may have been underappreciated in the broader public understanding of his achievements.[^48] This reflects a broader problem in mid-20th century science, where the hierarchical structure of laboratories often meant that senior scientists received credit for work that was truly collaborative. Sanger himself would likely have been uncomfortable with this critique, as he was known for his humility and his insistence on teamwork, but it raises important questions about how we attribute scientific credit.[^49]

There is also a critique related to the accessibility and democratization of science. Sanger worked in a privileged position at Cambridge University and later at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, institutions with substantial resources and funding.[^50] His Quaker background and family wealth allowed him to pursue science without immediate financial pressures, and he benefited from the elite educational opportunities available in Britain's class-stratified society.[^51] While Sanger himself cannot be faulted for these structural advantages, they raise broader questions about equity in scientific opportunity and whose voices and contributions are enabled by existing institutional structures.

Some critics of modern genomics and biotechnology have pointed to Sanger sequencing as a key enabling technology for developments they view as problematic, including genetic surveillance, proprietary ownership of genetic information, and the potential for genetic discrimination.[^52] While Sanger himself was focused on basic research and could not have foreseen all applications of his work, the dual-use nature of DNA sequencing technology has enabled both beneficial medical advances and potentially troubling surveillance and control applications.[^53] This raises complex questions about scientific responsibility for downstream applications of fundamental research.

Finally, from a contemporary perspective, Sanger's career reflects the gender and diversity imbalances that characterized mid-20th century science. His laboratories, like most in that era, were predominantly male, and the broader field of molecular biology had significant barriers to participation by women and minorities.[^54] While there is no evidence that Sanger personally discriminated, he was part of a system that systematically limited opportunities for underrepresented groups, and his success story is inherently intertwined with those structural inequalities.[^55]

## Personal Life

Frederick Sanger's personal life was characterized by the same modesty, dedication, and quiet determination that marked his scientific career. In 1940, while still a graduate student, he married Margaret Joan Howe, whom he had met through Quaker circles.[^56] Joan, as she was known, became a lifelong partner who supported his work while managing their household and raising their family. The couple had three children: Robin, born in 1943, Peter, born in 1946, and Sally Joan, born in 1960.[^57]

Despite his extraordinary scientific achievements, Sanger maintained a remarkably humble and private lifestyle. He was known for cycling to work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, often wearing the same worn cardigan for years.[^58] Colleagues recalled that he preferred working at the laboratory bench to attending conferences or giving lectures, and he was notably uncomfortable with public attention and celebrity.[^59] Even after winning his second Nobel Prize, Sanger continued to eschew grand gestures or self-promotion, declining a knighthood because he did not wish to be addressed as "Sir Frederick."[^60]

Sanger's Quaker values remained central to his identity throughout his life. The emphasis on simplicity, equality, and service influenced not only his personal lifestyle but also his approach to science and collaboration.[^61] He treated laboratory technicians and junior researchers with the same respect he accorded senior colleagues, and he was known for his willingness to share credit and acknowledge the contributions of others.[^62] This egalitarian approach helped create a collaborative and productive atmosphere in his laboratories.

Outside of science, Sanger enjoyed gardening and spending time with his family at their home in Swaffham Bulbeck, a village near Cambridge.[^63] He was an avid reader with wide-ranging interests, though he remained modest about his intellectual pursuits. Friends and colleagues described him as gentle, soft-spoken, and possessed of a dry sense of humor.[^64] He was not given to grand philosophical pronouncements about science or life, preferring to let his work speak for itself.

Joan Sanger was described by those who knew the family as a vital support to Frederick's career, managing the household and providing a stable home environment that allowed him to focus on his demanding research.[^65] However, like many women of her generation married to prominent scientists, her own aspirations and contributions were largely subsumed into her role as wife and mother. The Sangers' marriage lasted over 70 years until Joan's death in 2012, a year before Frederick's own passing.[^66]

Sanger retired from active research in 1983 at the age of 65, though he maintained connections with the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and followed developments in genomics with interest.[^67] In retirement, he spent more time gardening, reading, and with his family, which eventually grew to include grandchildren. He gave few interviews and declined most requests for public appearances, consistent with his lifelong preference for privacy.[^68]

Those who knew Sanger personally consistently emphasized his kindness, integrity, and lack of ego. Sydney Brenner, a Nobel Prize-winning colleague at the LMB, described him as "a quiet man who did his work with extraordinary dedication and who didn't want any fuss."[^69] John Sulston, another Nobel laureate who worked with Sanger, recalled: "Fred was the most modest person I have ever met. He didn't want fame or fortune. He just wanted to do his experiments."[^70]

In his later years, Sanger was cared for in a nursing home near Cambridge, where he died on November 19, 2013, at the age of 95.[^71] His death was marked by tributes from the scientific community worldwide, though in keeping with his character, his funeral was a small, private affair attended primarily by family and close friends.[^72] He left behind not only a transformative scientific legacy but also a model of how to conduct science with integrity, humility, and dedication to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.

## Legacy

Frederick Sanger's legacy in science is immense and multifaceted, extending far beyond his two Nobel Prizes to encompass the entire foundation of modern molecular biology and genomics. His development of methods to sequence proteins and DNA transformed biology from a largely descriptive science into a precise molecular discipline, enabling virtually all subsequent advances in genetics, medicine, and biotechnology.[^73]

The most visible monument to Sanger's legacy is the Wellcome Sanger Institute, established in 1993 and named in his honor (with his permission, a rare concession to public recognition).[^74] Located near Cambridge, the institute became one of the world's leading centers for genomic research and played a crucial role in the Human Genome Project, sequencing approximately one-third of the human genome.[^75] The institute continues to be at the forefront of genomic medicine, pathogen genomics, and understanding genetic diversity, directly carrying forward the work that Sanger pioneered.[^76]

Sanger sequencing remained the gold standard for DNA sequencing for over 30 years and was the primary technology used to complete the Human Genome Project in 2003.[^77] While newer "next-generation sequencing" technologies have largely superseded Sanger sequencing for large-scale projects, the method is still used for targeted sequencing, verification of results, and applications where high accuracy is paramount.[^78] The fundamental principle of Sanger's method—using chain-terminating nucleotides to create readable fragments—demonstrated an elegance of design that continues to inspire molecular biologists.

The Human Genome Project itself stands as perhaps the most significant practical realization of Sanger's vision. The ability to read the complete genetic blueprint of humanity, containing approximately 3 billion base pairs, has revolutionized our understanding of human biology, evolution, disease, and diversity.[^79] This achievement has enabled the era of personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, and has accelerated drug discovery and our understanding of cancer, rare diseases, and complex genetic conditions.[^80]

Beyond human genomics, Sanger's methods enabled the genomic revolution across all of biology. Thousands of species have now had their genomes sequenced, from bacteria to plants to animals, providing unprecedented insights into evolution, ecology, and the diversity of life on Earth.[^81] Agricultural genomics has enabled the development of improved crop varieties, while pathogen genomics has transformed our ability to track disease outbreaks and develop vaccines and treatments.[^82] The rapid sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in early 2020, which enabled the swift development of COVID-19 vaccines, was a direct descendant of Sanger's pioneering work.[^83]

Sanger's influence on scientific culture and practice may be as important as his specific technical contributions. He embodied an approach to science characterized by meticulous methodology, patience, rigor, and a focus on solving fundamental problems rather than chasing fashionable topics or easy publications.[^84] His modest, collaborative style and his dedication to the work itself rather than to fame or status provided a model for scientific integrity that continues to influence how many scientists view their vocation.[^85]

The Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, where Sanger spent most of his career, became one of the most successful research institutions in history, with numerous Nobel Prizes awarded to its scientists.[^86] The collaborative, non-hierarchical culture that Sanger exemplified contributed significantly to this success. The LMB's model of bringing together chemists, physicists, and biologists to work on fundamental questions in molecular biology has been emulated by research institutions worldwide.[^87]

In education and training, Sanger's impact ripples through generations of scientists. Many of his direct students and postdoctoral researchers became leaders in genomics, molecular biology, and biotechnology, and they in turn trained subsequent generations.[^88] The Sanger method is taught in biochemistry and molecular biology courses worldwide, introducing millions of students to the principles of nucleic acid analysis.[^89]

The biotechnology industry, now worth hundreds of billions of dollars globally, rests on foundations that Sanger helped establish.[^90] Companies focused on genetic testing, personalized medicine, agricultural biotechnology, and pharmaceutical development all depend fundamentally on DNA sequencing technologies that descend from his work.[^91] While Sanger himself never sought to commercialize his discoveries or profit from patents, his research enabled an entire economic sector.

Sanger has been commemorated in numerous ways beyond the institute that bears his name. The Frederick Sanger Prize, established by the Biochemical Society, recognizes outstanding achievements by early-career researchers.[^92] In 2013, the Bank of England announced that Sanger was being considered for inclusion on a future British banknote, though this has not yet been realized.[^93] More substantially, his papers and notebooks have been preserved and studied by historians of science, providing insights into the development of molecular biology as a discipline.[^94]

Perhaps Sanger's most profound legacy is the way his work enabled humanity to read the "book of life"—to understand the genetic instructions that underlie all living organisms. This capability has implications for virtually every aspect of human endeavor that intersects with biology, from medicine to agriculture, from forensics to anthropology, from conservation to synthetic biology.[^95] The ethical, social, and philosophical questions raised by our ability to read and now edit genetic information are still being grappled with, and they stem directly from the technical capabilities that Sanger's pioneering work made possible.[^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

The scientific community's assessment of Frederick Sanger is overwhelmingly positive, with many historians of science regarding him as one of the most important biochemists of the 20th century. Sir John Walker, a Nobel laureate who worked at the LMB, stated: "Fred Sanger is one of the very few scientists who can be said to have really transformed science. His contribution to biology is immeasurable."[^97] This sentiment is widely echoed by scientists across disciplines who recognize that modern molecular biology would be unimaginable without Sanger's foundational contributions.

Scholars particularly praise Sanger's methodological innovations and his ability to solve problems that others considered intractable. Historian of science Horace Freeland Judson, in his comprehensive account of molecular biology "The Eighth Day of Creation," describes Sanger's work on insulin as "a tour de force of chemical detective work" that established protein chemistry as a rigorous discipline.[^98] The elegance and reliability of Sanger's methods, developed with meticulous care over years of patient experimentation, set new standards for biochemical research.[^99]

Many commentators highlight Sanger's personal qualities as being as important as his technical achievements. Nobel Prize winner Sydney Brenner noted: "Fred was not interested in theories or big ideas. He was interested in doing experiments and getting them right. And he did them better than anyone else."[^100] This focus on experimental rigor and reproducibility contributed to the solid foundations of molecular biology, in contrast to fields where theoretical speculation sometimes outpaced empirical validation.

The Royal Society, in awarding Sanger the Copley Medal in 1977, praised his "pioneering work on the determination of the structure of proteins, particularly insulin, and on the determination of base sequences in nucleic acids."[^101] The citation emphasized not only his specific achievements but also his role in creating entirely new fields of investigation. Similarly, when Sanger received the Order of Merit in 1986, one of Britain's highest honors, it recognized his "exceptional distinction in science" and his contributions to human knowledge.[^102]

Educational scholars appreciate Sanger's legacy in training scientists and establishing methodological standards. Georgina Ferry, in her biography "Max Perutz and the Secret of Life," notes that Sanger's approach to mentoring—supportive but demanding, collaborative but rigorous—helped create a culture of excellence at the LMB that persists to this day.[^103] The scientists who trained with Sanger often cite his influence on their approach to research, emphasizing careful experimental design and thoroughness over speed or flash.

From a medical perspective, clinicians and medical researchers recognize Sanger's work as foundational to modern medicine. The ability to sequence genes has enabled the identification of genetic causes of disease, the development of targeted therapies, and the emergence of precision medicine.[^104] Dr. Francis Collins, former director of the National Institutes of Health and leader of the Human Genome Project, has stated that "all of us who work in genomics stand on the shoulders of Fred Sanger" and credited his methods with making the Human Genome Project feasible.[^105]

Philosophical and ethical analyses of Sanger's career often hold him up as an exemplar of science conducted with integrity and humility. His refusal of a knighthood, his modest lifestyle despite international acclaim, and his focus on the work itself rather than personal aggrandizement provide a counterpoint to stereotypes of scientific ego and competition.[^106] Ethicist and philosopher of science Michael Ruse has pointed to Sanger as an example of how scientists can achieve greatness while maintaining ethical standards and personal humility.[^107]

### Negative Views

While Frederick Sanger himself is rarely criticized directly, some scholars have raised concerns about aspects of his work's context and implications. Sociologists of science have pointed out that Sanger's success story, while inspiring, reflects privileges of class, gender, and nationality that were not available to many potentially talented researchers of his era.[^108] His ability to pursue research without immediate financial pressure, his access to elite educational institutions, and the support systems available to him as a white British man in prestigious academic settings are noted as advantages that shaped his career trajectory.[^109]

Some critics of modern genomics and biotechnology view Sanger's development of DNA sequencing with ambivalence, recognizing its scientific brilliance while worrying about its applications. Scholars concerned with genetic privacy and surveillance have pointed out that the same technologies used for medical diagnostics can be used for genetic discrimination, forensic databases of questionable consent, and forms of biological monitoring that raise civil liberties concerns.[^110] While these applications were not Sanger's intent, they raise questions about scientific responsibility for foreseeable misuses of powerful technologies.

Bioethicists have also grappled with the implications of genomic knowledge that Sanger's work enabled. The ability to identify genetic predispositions to disease creates ethical dilemmas around testing, disclosure, and the psychological impact of genetic knowledge.[^111] Prenatal genetic testing, now routine in many countries, raises complex questions about selective abortion and what constitutes a life worth living.[^112] While Sanger cannot be held responsible for these ethical quandaries, his work was instrumental in creating the technical capabilities that make them possible.

From a political economy perspective, some analysts have criticized how Sanger's publicly funded research has been appropriated for private profit. While Sanger himself never sought patents or commercial gain from his discoveries, biotechnology companies have built massive fortunes on sequencing technologies, sometimes creating barriers to access for medical applications through intellectual property claims on subsequent innovations.[^113] Critics argue that the fruits of publicly funded research should remain more accessible and that the commercialization of genomics has created equity issues in healthcare access.[^114]

Environmental and social critics of genetic engineering have sometimes portrayed Sanger's work as opening a "Pandora's box" of genetic manipulation. While Sanger himself worked on sequencing—reading genetic information—rather than genetic engineering—changing it—his methods were prerequisite for the development of technologies like CRISPR that enable precise genetic editing.[^115] Concerns about designer babies, genetic enhancement, and the potential for eugenics are sometimes traced back to the capabilities that DNA sequencing enabled, though these were far from Sanger's intentions.[^116]

A few historians of science have suggested that the overwhelming focus on Sanger's individual genius obscures the collaborative nature of scientific work and the contributions of technicians, students, and colleagues whose names are less celebrated.[^117] While Sanger himself was scrupulous about acknowledging collaborators, popular accounts of his achievements sometimes portray him as a lone genius, a narrative that these critics argue distorts the actual practice of science and undervalues the contributions of the many people who make scientific breakthroughs possible.[^118]

Some scholars studying the history of molecular biology have also noted that the focus on sequencing and molecular reductionism—understanding organisms by reading their genetic code—may have come at the expense of other approaches to biology, such as ecology, developmental biology, or systems-level understanding of organisms.[^119] While Sanger's work was scientifically brilliant, the paradigm it helped establish has been criticized for sometimes privileging genetic explanations over environmental, developmental, or systemic factors in understanding biology.[^120]
