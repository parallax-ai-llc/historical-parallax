## Summary

Andrea del Verrocchio was a leading Florentine artist whose workshop trained Leonardo da Vinci, Perugino, and Botticelli. His bronze equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice is one of the finest Renaissance sculptures. His versatility across sculpture, painting, and metalwork made his bottega the most important in 15th-century Florence.
