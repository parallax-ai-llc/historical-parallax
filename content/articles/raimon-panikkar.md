## Summary

Raimon Panikkar was a Spanish-Indian Catholic priest, philosopher, and theologian who was one of the pioneers of interreligious dialogue. Born to a Hindu father and a Catholic mother, he embodied the meeting of East and West. He famously said: 'I left as a Christian, found myself a Hindu, and returned as a Buddhist, without ever ceasing to be a Christian.' His works on Christophany and the cosmotheandric vision proposed a radical interreligious theology.
