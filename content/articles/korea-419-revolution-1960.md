## Summary

On April 19, 1960, over 100,000 South Korean students marched on the presidential Blue House demanding the resignation of President Syngman Rhee. Police opened fire. By day's end, approximately 180 lay dead in Seoul alone. But the students kept coming, and within a week, Rhee—who had ruled since 1948—fled to Hawaii. The 4.19 Revolution (사일구 혁명) became South Korea's first successful democratic uprising.[^1]

The revolution was sparked by the blatantly rigged March 15, 1960 presidential election, in which the aging Rhee claimed nearly 89% of the vote. Protests erupted immediately in the southern city of Masan. When a high school student, Kim Ju-yul, disappeared during these protests and was later found floating in the harbor with a tear gas canister embedded in his skull, the nation exploded in outrage.[^2]

The 4.19 Revolution established a model that would echo through Korean history: students as the conscience of the nation, willing to die for democracy. But the democratic Second Republic that followed lasted only a year before Park Chung-hee's military coup. The revolution's ideals would wait decades for fulfillment—resurrected in Gwangju (1980) and the June Democratic Struggle (1987). April 19 is now a national holiday: Revolution Day.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Syngman Rhee's First Republic

Syngman Rhee (이승만) ruled South Korea from 1948:

- **Independence fighter:** Prominent anti-Japanese activist
- **Authoritarian consolidation:** Amended constitution to extend rule
- **Korean War (1950-1953):** Survived with US support
- **Political manipulation:** Opposition suppressed; elections managed
- **Aging grip:** By 1960, Rhee was 85 and increasingly out of touch[^4]

### March 15, 1960 Election

Rhee's fourth term election was brazenly fraudulent:

**Methods:**
- Pre-marked ballots stuffed into boxes
- Voters forced to vote in groups (open voting)
- Opposition poll watchers excluded
- Vote counts manipulated

**Result:** Rhee claimed 88.7%; running mate Lee Ki-poong claimed 79%

The public knew it was a lie. In Masan, protests began immediately.[^5]

## The Revolution

### Masan Uprising (March 15)

Protests erupted in Masan on election day:
- Demonstrators attacked polling stations
- Police fired on crowds; seven killed
- Martial law declared locally
- Kim Ju-yul, 17, disappeared[^6]

### Kim Ju-yul's Discovery (April 11)

**April 11:** Kim Ju-yul's body found floating in Masan harbor
- Tear gas grenade embedded in his skull (fired into his eye)
- Government initially claimed drowning
- Protesters forced into hospital morgue; saw the truth
- Photographs spread nationwide

Kim became a martyr; his death catalyzed the revolution.[^7]

### April 18: University Students Mobilize

Korea University students marched in Seoul; attacked by political thugs on their return. This galvanized other universities.

### April 19: "Bloody Tuesday"

**April 19, 1960:**
- 100,000+ students from universities and high schools marched in Seoul
- Protesters headed toward the Blue House (presidential residence)
- Police opened fire with live ammunition
- ~180 killed in Seoul; thousands wounded nationwide
- Martial law declared
- Protests continued despite curfew[^8]

### April 25-26: Rhee Falls

**April 25:** University professors joined, marching in academic robes—a decisive symbolic shift

**April 26:** 
- National Assembly demanded Rhee's resignation
- US expressed concern; withdrew support
- Rhee announced resignation and exile
- Lee Ki-poong's family committed group suicide

Rhee flew to Hawaii, where he died in 1965.[^9]

## Death Toll

**Total killed during April Revolution:** ~186 (some sources: 180-200)

**April 19 alone:** ~180 in Seoul

**Injured:** Thousands (estimates vary: 6,000+)

**Most victims:** High school and university students

The youngest were teenagers; many shot in the back while fleeing.[^10]

## Historical Assessment

### Revolutionary Perspective

**First Democratic Victory:** The 4.19 Revolution proved that Korean citizens would fight for democracy. Students—high schoolers and university students—faced bullets for their beliefs. Their sacrifice ended 12 years of authoritarian rule and established the principle that illegitimate power could be overthrown.[^11]

**Moral Foundation:** The revolution created a legacy that later movements inherited. The Gwangju Uprising (1980) and June Democratic Struggle (1987) drew explicitly on 4.19's symbolism. "Spirit of 4.19" became shorthand for democratic aspiration.

### Critical Perspective

**Unfinished Revolution:** The Second Republic lasted only 13 months before Park Chung-hee seized power in a 1961 coup. Democracy did not truly arrive until 1987. Some argue the revolution's idealism exceeded its institutional capacity—it removed Rhee but didn't build lasting democratic structures.

**Cold War Constraints:** The US ultimately facilitated Rhee's departure, but American priorities (anti-communism, stability) shaped what followed. Full democracy was deferred.

### Government Perspective (Historical)

Park Chung-hee's regime (1961-1979) framed the revolution ambivalently—acknowledging its anti-corruption dimension while criticizing its "disorder." Later authoritarian regimes tried to co-opt or minimize its legacy.[^12]

## Aftermath

### Second Republic (1960-1961)

- Parliamentary system under PM Chang Myon
- Greater press freedom; political opening
- Economic difficulties; political instability
- **May 16, 1961:** Park Chung-hee's military coup ended it

### Long-Term Legacy

- April 19 became national holiday (1960)
- 4.19 National Cemetery established
- Spirit invoked in 1980, 1987, and beyond
- Part of Korean democratic tradition alongside Gwangju[^13]

## Legacy

### For South Korea

- First successful popular uprising
- Students as political actors
- Model for future movements
- April 19 commemorated annually
- Part of national democratic narrative

### For Democracy

- Showed nonviolent mass protest could succeed
- Connected to global 1960s student movements
- Inspiration for later Asian democratization

### Symbolic Importance

The 4.19 Revolution established that Koreans would not accept authoritarian rule passively. Though democracy was deferred, the revolution planted seeds that ultimately grew into the democratic Republic of Korea.[^14]
