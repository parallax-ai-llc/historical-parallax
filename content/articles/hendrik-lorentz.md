## Summary

Hendrik Lorentz was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman for research on the influence of magnetism on radiation. He developed the Lorentz transformations, which became fundamental to Einstein's special relativity. His electromagnetic theory of matter and concept of local time were precursors to relativity theory. The Lorentz force and Lorentz factor bear his name.
