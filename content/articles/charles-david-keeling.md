## Summary

Charles David Keeling began continuous measurements of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory in 1958, producing the Keeling Curve — the most important dataset in climate science. His measurements provided the first definitive evidence that CO2 levels were rising due to human activities. The Keeling Curve became the iconic symbol of climate change.
