## Summary
Leonarda Cianciulli, the 'Soap-Maker of Correggio,' was an Italian serial killer who murdered three women in Correggio, Italy between 1939 and 1940. She turned their bodies into soap, teacakes, and other products, believing human sacrifice would protect her son from the war. Her story became one of Italy's most bizarre criminal cases.

## Early Life
Born April 14, 1894, in Montella, Italy. She had a deeply unhappy childhood and an arranged marriage. She suffered numerous miscarriages and stillbirths. She was extremely superstitious and believed a fortune teller's prediction that all her children would die. [^1]

## Criminal Career
When her eldest son Giuseppe was called to serve in WWII, Cianciulli became convinced that human sacrifices were needed to protect him. Between 1939 and 1940, she killed three women — Faustina Setti, Francesca Soavi, and Virginia Cacioppo — by drugging them with drugged wine and killing them with an axe. She rendered their bodies into soap and teacakes. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Cianciulli was caught when the sister-in-law of her third victim reported her suspicions to police. She confessed and described the murders in detailed, matter-of-fact terms. She was convicted of three murders in 1946 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She died in a women's criminal asylum in Pozzuoli on October 15, 1970. [^3]
