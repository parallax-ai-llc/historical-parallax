## Summary

Sonam Gyatso was the third Dalai Lama (the title was applied retroactively to his two predecessors). He received the title 'Dalai Lama' from the Mongol ruler Altan Khan in 1578, meaning 'Ocean of Wisdom.' He was responsible for converting the Mongols to Tibetan Buddhism. His meeting with Altan Khan was one of the most important events in Central Asian religious history.
