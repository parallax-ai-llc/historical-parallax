## Summary

Toyoichi Tanaka was a Japanese physicist at MIT who discovered the volume phase transition in polymer gels, showing that gels can dramatically swell or collapse in response to small changes in temperature, pH, or chemical environment. This discovery launched the field of smart gels with applications in drug delivery, sensors, and artificial muscles.
