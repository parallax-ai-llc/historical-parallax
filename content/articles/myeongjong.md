## Summary

Myeongjong (born July 3, 1534; died August 2, 1567) was the 13th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1545 to 1567.[^1] His reign is characterized by the overwhelming power of his mother, **Queen Munjeong**, who acted as regent, and the corruption of her relatives (User:the Lesser Yun faction), led by **Yun Won-hyeong**. It was a tumultuous period marked by the **Eulsa Sahwa** (literati purge), the rise of the bandit **Im Kkeok-jeong**, and the temporary revival of Buddhism. Myeongjong ascended the throne at the age of 12 and spent most of his reign trying to escape his mother's shadow.[^2]

## The Boy King and the Queen Regent

Myeongjong was the son of King Jungjong and his third wife, Queen Munjeong. When his half-brother Injong died after less than a year on the throne, Myeongjong ascended at age 12.
*   **Regency:** Queen Munjeong ruled the country with an iron fist for 20 years (officially ending regency in 1553 but continuing to hold power until her death in 1565).
*   **Corruption:** Her brother **Yun Won-hyeong** became the most powerful man in the country, amassing immense wealth and purging rivals.[^3]

## Eulsa Sahwa (The Purge of 1545)

Immediately upon Myeongjong's accession, a bloody power struggle erupted between the Queen's faction (Lesser Yun) and the faction of the late King Injong's uncle (Greater Yun).
*   **The Purge:** Queen Munjeong and Yun Won-hyeong accused the "Greater Yun" faction of treason. Scores of scholars and officials were executed or exiled, decimating the Sarim scholar faction.[^4]

---

## Social Unrest and Im Kkeok-jeong

The corruption of the ruling elite and heavy taxation led to widespread suffering among the common people.
*   **Im Kkeok-jeong:** A butcher-turned-bandit leader (Joseon's "Robin Hood") organized a peasant rebellion in Hwanghae Province (1559–1562). He raided government storehouses and distributed grain to the poor. The royal army struggled for three years to suppress his band, highlighting the weakness of the state.[^5]

## Revival of Buddhism

Queen Munjeong was a devout Buddhist in a Confucian state.
*   **Support:** She lifted the ban on Buddhism, reinstated the monk examination system (Seunggwa), and supported famous monks like **Bo-u**. This led to a brief renaissance of Buddhism, although it was fiercely opposed by Confucian scholars.[^6]

## Death and Succession

After his mother died in 1565, Myeongjong finally tried to rule independently and recruit talented scholars. However, his health was weak, and he died just two years later in 1567 at the age of 33.
*   **Heirless:** His only son, Crown Prince Sunhoe, died young. Myeongjong was succeeded by his half-nephew, **Seonjo**, marking the end of the direct line of descent from Jungjong.[^7]
