## Overview

The Battle of Britain (July 10 – October 31, 1940) was the first major military campaign in history fought entirely by air forces. Following the fall of France, Great Britain stood alone against Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler planned an amphibious invasion of the UK (**Operation Sea Lion**), but his prerequisites required the Luftwaffe to destroy the Royal Air Force (RAF) to secure air superiority over the English Channel. For three months, the skies over southern England were filled with swirling majestic dogfights. Despite being outnumbered, the RAF held firm, aided by the revolutionary "Dowding System" of radar control. Hitler eventually postponed the invasion indefinitely, marking his first strategic defeat.

## Order of Battle

### Royal Air Force (RAF) - Fighter Command
**Commander:** Air Chief Marshal **Hugh Dowding**.
**System:** The "Dowding System" integrated Radar (Chain Home), the Observer Corps, and Fighter Control command centers to scramble planes exactly where needed, preserving fuel and pilot fatigue.
**Aircraft:** ~640 servicable fighters.
- **Supermarine Spitfire:** Agile, fast. Tasked with engaging German fighters.
- **Hawker Hurricane:** Slower, sturdy gun platform. Tasked with shooting down bombers. (Actually scored 60% of kills).

### Luftwaffe (German Air Force)
**Commander:** Reichsmarschall **Hermann Göring**.
**Strength:** ~2,600 aircraft (1,200 fighters, 1,400 bombers).
**Aircraft:**
- **Messerschmitt Bf 109E:** Superior climber/diver to Spitfire, but limited fuel (only 10-20 mins combat time over London).
- **Heinkel He 111 / Dornier Do 17:** Medium bombers. Vulnerable to interception.
- **Ju 87 Stuka:** Dive bomber. Proved so vulnerable they were withdrawn from battle immediately.

## Phases of the Battle

### Phase 1: The Channel Battles (Kanalkampf) [July 10 - Aug 12]
Luftwaffe attacked shipping convoys in the English Channel to draw out the RAF.
**Result:** RAF lost planes but learned tactics. Dowding refused to commit his main force.

### Phase 2: Eagle Attack (Adlertag) [Aug 13 - Sept 6]
Göring ordered destruction of RAF capability.
Massive raids on:
- **Radar Stations:** Briefly blinded the RAF (Ventnor station destroyed), but Germans stopped attacking them, thinking they were hard to hit. Critical error.
- **Airfields:** Biggin Hill, Manston sector stations bombed repeatedly.
**Crisis:** RAF was breaking. Pilots were exhausted. Production of planes was fine, but pilot training couldn't keep up with losses.

### Phase 3: The Blitz (Sept 7 - Oct 31)
**The Accident:** On Aug 24, a lost German bomber dumped loads on London civilians.
**The Retaliation:** Churchill ordered a raid on Berlin (Aug 25).
**The Mistake:** Hitler, furious at the "insult," ordered the Luftwaffe to switch targets from **Airfields** to **London**.
**Result:**
- **London:** 57 consecutive nights of bombing. 40,000 civilians died.
- **RAF:** The pressure was lifted off the airfields. They repaired runways and rested pilots.
- **Sept 15 (Battle of Britain Day):** Germany launched massive daylight raid on London. RAF met them in force (proving they weren't destroyed). Luftwaffe lost 60 planes.

## Key Factors in Victory

1.  **Radar (Chain Home):** allowed RAF to see enemy forming up in France. Removed the "surprise" factor.
2.  **Home Field Advantage:** A shot-down RAF pilot could parachute down and be back in a new plane by afternoon. A shot-down German pilot was a POW.
3.  **Fuel:** Bf 109s had to leave bombers unprotected when fuel ran low.
4.  **100 Octane Fuel:** US-supplied high-performance fuel gave Merlines engines slight edge.
