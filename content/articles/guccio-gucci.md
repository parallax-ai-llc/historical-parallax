## Summary

Guccio Gucci founded the House of Gucci in Florence in 1921, creating one of the world's most iconic luxury fashion brands. Inspired by fine luggage he saw while working at the Savoy Hotel in London, he began crafting leather goods. The double-G logo and bamboo-handle bag became symbols of Italian luxury. His descendants feuded over the company before it was eventually acquired by Kering Group.
