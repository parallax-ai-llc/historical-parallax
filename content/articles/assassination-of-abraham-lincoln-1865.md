## Overview

On Good Friday, April 14, 1865, just five days after General Lee's surrender at Appomattox effectively ended the American Civil War, President **Abraham Lincoln** attended a play at Ford's Theatre. There, he became the first U.S. president to be assassinated. The perpetrator was **John Wilkes Booth**, a well-known stage actor and Confederate sympathizer. Lincoln's death plunged a celebrating nation into mourning and dramatically altered the course of Reconstruction, replacing Lincoln's policy of "malice toward none" with a bitter struggle between Andrew Johnson and the Radical Republicans.

## The Conspiracy

Booth had originally planned to kidnap Lincoln to exchange him for Confederate prisoners. But after hearing Lincoln speak on April 11 supporting voting rights for Black people, Booth changed his plan to murder, vowing: *"That is the last speech he will ever make."*
It was a multi-pronged conspiracy. Booth assigned co-conspirators to kill:
1.  **Vice President Andrew Johnson** (George Atzerodt lost his nerve and got drunk instead).
2.  **Secretary of State William Seward** (Lewis Powell attacked him in bed with a knife, severely wounding him but failing to kill him).

## The Night at Ford's Theatre

The play was a British comedy, *Our American Cousin*.
Lincoln was in the Presidential Box with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, Major Henry Rathbone, and Rathbone's fiancée.
**10:15 PM:**
Booth, knowing the play by heart, waited for the line that guaranteed the loudest laughter to muffle the gunshot ("You sockdologizing old man-trap!").
He slipped into the box and shot Lincoln in the back of the head with a .44 caliber Derringer.
**The Escape:**
Booth leaped from the box to the stage, catching his spur on the flag (bunting), and breaking his left leg.
He shouted *"Sic semper tyrannis!"* (Thus always to tyrants) and fled into the night on horseback.

## The Long Night

Lincoln was carried across the street to the **Petersen House**. He never regained consciousness.
Doctors deemed the wound mortal; the bullet was lodged behind his right eye.
Cabinet members, politicians, and generals gathered in the small bedroom.
**7:22 AM, April 15:**
Lincoln stopped breathing. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton famously remarked: *"Now he belongs to the ages."*

## The Manhunt

A massive 12-day manhunt ensued.
Booth and his accomplice David Herold hid in the Maryland swamps and crossed the Potomac into Virginia, shocked that the Southern newspapers condemned his act instead of praising him as a hero.
**Garrett's Farm:**
On April 26, Union cavalry cornered them in a tobacco barn. The soldiers set the barn on fire.
Sergeant Boston Corbett shot Booth (claiming God guided his hand). Booth died hours later, looking at his hands and whispering his last words: *"Useless, useless."*

## Execution of Conspirators

Four conspirators, including **Mary Surratt** (the first woman executed by the US federal government), were hanged on July 7, 1865.
