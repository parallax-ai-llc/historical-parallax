## Summary

Willis Lamb was an American physicist who won the 1955 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discoveries concerning the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum. The Lamb shift, a small difference in energy levels in hydrogen, provided crucial evidence that quantum electrodynamics was needed to describe atomic phenomena accurately. His work stimulated the development of modern QED by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga.
