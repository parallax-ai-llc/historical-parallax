## Summary

Akka Mahadevi was a 12th-century Indian Shaivite mystic and poet who is one of the earliest female Bhakti saints. She composed Vachanas (mystical prose poems) in Kannada expressing her total devotion to Lord Shiva. She renounced worldly life, including her clothing, and wandered as a naked ascetic. Her bold spiritual independence and literary genius made her one of the most remarkable figures in medieval Indian spirituality.
