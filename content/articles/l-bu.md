## Summary

Lü Bu (呂布) was one of the most formidable warriors and controversial figures of the late Eastern Han Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. Renowned for his unmatched martial prowess and skill with the halberd, he became legendary as the most powerful warrior of his era, yet equally infamous for his repeated betrayals of his lords and adoptive fathers. His military career was marked by shifting allegiances, serving under Ding Yuan, Dong Zhuo, and various other warlords before establishing his own independent power base. Despite his tactical brilliance and combat superiority, his lack of political acumen, paranoia, and inability to maintain loyal relationships ultimately led to his capture and execution by Cao Cao in 199 CE, cementing his legacy as both a fearsome warrior and a cautionary tale of unchecked ambition.

## Early Life and Background

Lü Bu was born around 156 CE in Jiuyuan Commandery (in modern-day Inner Mongolia) during the late Eastern Han Dynasty, a period marked by increasing political instability and the weakening of central imperial authority[^1]. Little is recorded about his family background, though historical sources indicate he came from a relatively obscure background in the northern frontier regions of the Han Empire[^2]. The northern borderlands were characterized by constant military conflicts with nomadic tribes, which likely shaped Lü Bu's early exposure to warfare and horsemanship.

From his youth, Lü Bu demonstrated exceptional physical strength and martial ability, particularly in archery and mounted combat[^3]. The Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi) describes him as possessing extraordinary courage and skill with weapons, especially the ji (halberd), which would become his signature weapon[^4]. His prowess in horseback archery, a skill essential for frontier warfare, earned him early recognition among military circles in the northern commanderies.

Growing up in the militarized frontier society, Lü Bu received practical military training rather than the classical Confucian education valued by the Han aristocracy[^5]. This background would later contribute to his reputation as a purely martial figure lacking in literary accomplishments and political sophistication. The harsh conditions of the northern frontier, where survival often depended on martial skill and swift decision-making, forged his character as a warrior but failed to instill the strategic patience and loyalty valued in Chinese political culture[^6].

By his early twenties, Lü Bu had already established a reputation as an exceptional warrior, attracting the attention of Ding Yuan, the Governor of Bing Province, who recruited him into his military forces around 184 CE[^7]. This marked the beginning of Lü Bu's entry into the tumultuous political arena of the late Han Dynasty, where his martial talents would propel him to fame even as his character flaws would lead to his eventual downfall.

---

## Rise to Power

Lü Bu's ascent in the chaotic political landscape of late Han China began when he entered the service of Ding Yuan, a provincial governor who recognized the young warrior's exceptional combat abilities[^8]. Ding Yuan treated Lü Bu with considerable favor, reportedly addressing him as his adopted son and appointing him as a cavalry commander. This relationship gave Lü Bu his first taste of significant military authority and access to the corridors of power during the turbulent period following the Yellow Turban Rebellion[^9].

The pivotal moment in Lü Bu's rise came in 189 CE, during the power vacuum created by Emperor Ling's death. The warlord Dong Zhuo, seeking to consolidate control over the imperial court, approached Lü Bu with promises of greater rewards and status[^10]. In the first of what would become a pattern of betrayals, Lü Bu murdered his adoptive father Ding Yuan and presented his head to Dong Zhuo, bringing with him Ding Yuan's elite cavalry forces. This act of treachery shocked contemporaries but demonstrated Lü Bu's willingness to prioritize personal advancement over loyalty[^11].

Dong Zhuo rewarded Lü Bu lavishly, making him a General of the Household Cavalry and treating him as his own adopted son[^12]. During this period, Lü Bu served as Dong Zhuo's primary military enforcer, helping to terrorize the imperial court and aristocracy. His combat prowess made him invaluable to Dong Zhuo's regime, and he was entrusted with command of elite troops. However, Lü Bu's relationship with Dong Zhuo began to deteriorate due to several factors: Dong Zhuo's increasingly erratic and violent behavior, the warlord's suspicion of Lü Bu's ambitions, and allegedly, Lü Bu's affair with Dong Zhuo's concubine Diaochan (though this romantic element may be fictional embellishment)[^13].

In 192 CE, Lü Bu participated in a conspiracy led by Wang Yun, the Minister over the Masses, to assassinate Dong Zhuo[^14]. Lü Bu personally killed his second adoptive father, stabbing Dong Zhuo with a halberd in front of the imperial palace. This second major betrayal earned Lü Bu temporary status as a hero who had freed the court from a tyrant, and he was appointed General of the Gentlemen of the Household and granted a marquis title[^15]. However, Dong Zhuo's former officers, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, soon counterattacked, forcing Lü Bu to flee the capital.

Following his expulsion from Chang'an, Lü Bu wandered across northern China seeking refuge with various warlords between 192 and 194 CE[^16]. He briefly served Yuan Shu, Yuan Shao, and Zhang Yang, but his reputation for disloyalty made these alliances tenuous. During this period, Lü Bu demonstrated his military capabilities in various engagements but struggled to establish a stable power base due to distrust from potential patrons[^17]. His fortunes changed in 194 CE when he was invited by Chen Gong, a dissatisfied advisor of Cao Cao, to seize control of Yan Province while Cao Cao was away campaigning. Lü Bu successfully captured the region, establishing himself as an independent warlord for the first time[^18].

## Major Achievements

Lü Bu's reputation as the preeminent warrior of the Three Kingdoms era was built upon numerous military accomplishments that demonstrated his exceptional combat prowess and tactical abilities[^19]. His greatest strength lay in cavalry warfare, where he commanded elite mounted units with devastating effectiveness, utilizing superior mobility and shock tactics that few contemporaries could match.

One of Lü Bu's most celebrated military feats was his role in the assassination of Dong Zhuo in 192 CE, which required not only political daring but also the martial skill to personally strike down one of the most powerful warlords of the era while surrounded by his bodyguards[^20]. This act, whatever its moral implications, demonstrated Lü Bu's courage and decisive action in critical moments. The successful execution of this high-risk operation showcased his ability to function under extreme pressure and highlighted why he was feared as a warrior.

During his period controlling Yan Province (194-195 CE), Lü Bu demonstrated considerable tactical acumen in his campaigns against Cao Cao, one of the era's most brilliant strategists[^21]. In several engagements, Lü Bu's cavalry forces inflicted significant casualties on Cao Cao's armies, exploiting their mobility advantage and Lü Bu's superior understanding of cavalry tactics. The Battle of Puyang in particular saw Lü Bu nearly capture Cao Cao himself during a surprise attack, an achievement that few other commanders of the period accomplished[^22]. These military successes forced Cao Cao to commit substantial resources to the Yan Province campaign over multiple years.

Perhaps Lü Bu's most famous personal achievement was the legendary feat known as "Shooting the Ji" (轅門射戟), which occurred in 196 CE when he had established himself in Xu Province[^23]. When two rival warlords, Liu Bei and Yuan Shu's general Ji Ling, were on the verge of battle near Lü Bu's territory, he proposed a challenge: he would plant his halberd 150 paces away, and if he could strike its small crescent blade with an arrow, both parties should cease hostilities. Lü Bu successfully made this extraordinarily difficult shot, demonstrating archery skills that awed witnesses and temporarily resolved the conflict without bloodshed[^24]. While this episode may contain legendary embellishment, it reflects the historical reality of Lü Bu's reputation for superhuman martial abilities.

Lü Bu's military innovations included the effective integration of cavalry and infantry forces, drawing upon his northern frontier background where such combined arms tactics were essential for combating nomadic raiders[^25]. His Red Hare horse (赤兔馬) became legendary as the finest warhorse of the era, symbolizing Lü Bu's status as the supreme mounted warrior. Historical accounts suggest this horse possessed exceptional speed and endurance, giving Lü Bu a significant tactical advantage in battlefield mobility[^26].

During his control of Xu Province from 196-198 CE, Lü Bu demonstrated some capacity for civil administration, maintaining relative stability in the region despite the surrounding chaos[^27]. He managed to balance competing interests among local aristocratic families and provided protection against banditry and rival warlords' incursions. His court attracted talented individuals such as Chen Gong, a brilliant strategist, and Zhang Liao, an outstanding general who would later become one of Cao Cao's most celebrated commanders[^28].

Lü Bu's defensive operations during Cao Cao's siege of Xiapi in 198-199 CE showcased his abilities as a defensive commander[^29]. Despite being outnumbered and facing one of history's greatest military minds, Lü Bu's forces held out for several months in fortified positions, inflicting considerable casualties on Cao Cao's besieging armies. The siege only succeeded due to internal betrayal and the diversion of water supplies, rather than direct military defeat in the field[^30].

His reputation as an undefeated warrior in personal combat remained intact throughout his career—historical sources record no instance of Lü Bu being bested in single combat or hand-to-hand fighting[^31]. This personal invincibility contributed significantly to his psychological impact on enemies and his ability to inspire his troops. Generals and soldiers who faced Lü Bu on the battlefield reportedly experienced significant morale disadvantages simply due to his fearsome reputation[^32].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his martial prowess, Lü Bu's character and actions generated severe criticism from contemporaries and later historians, establishing him as one of the most morally condemned figures in Chinese historical literature[^33]. The most damning aspect of his legacy was his pattern of betraying adoptive fathers and benefactors, an offense that violated fundamental Confucian principles of filial piety and loyalty that formed the moral foundation of Chinese society.

Lü Bu's murder of Ding Yuan, his first adoptive father who had elevated him from obscurity, shocked contemporaries as an act of extreme treachery[^34]. The assassination was motivated purely by personal gain—Dong Zhuo's offer of superior rewards and status. This betrayal was compounded when Lü Bu repeated the pattern by killing Dong Zhuo, his second adoptive father, in 192 CE[^35]. While Dong Zhuo was widely regarded as a tyrant whose death benefited the realm, Lü Bu's motivations were questioned, with many suggesting personal grievances and ambition rather than righteous indignation drove his actions. The Confucian historian Chen Shou, author of the Records of the Three Kingdoms, characterized Lü Bu as having "the courage of a tiger but the mind of a wolf," emphasizing his predatory nature and lack of moral principle[^36].

Lü Bu's seizure of Xu Province from Liu Bei in 196 CE represented another significant betrayal that damaged his reputation[^37]. Liu Bei had provided Lü Bu with refuge when he was fleeing from enemies, offering him shelter and provisions. In return, Lü Bu took advantage of Liu Bei's absence during a campaign to seize control of Xiapi, Liu Bei's base of operations, forcing his benefactor into a subordinate position. This act of ingratitude and opportunism exemplified the untrustworthiness that made other warlords reluctant to ally with Lü Bu despite his military value[^38].

Historical sources portray Lü Bu as lacking strategic vision and political acumen, focusing excessively on martial glory while neglecting administrative and diplomatic aspects of leadership[^39]. His inability to maintain stable alliances or build a sustainable power base stemmed from his reputation for betrayal, which isolated him diplomatically. Unlike successful warlords such as Cao Cao, Liu Bei, or Sun Quan, who cultivated networks of loyal subordinates and allies, Lü Bu's court was characterized by suspicion and opportunism, mirroring his own character[^40].

Lü Bu's treatment of his advisors revealed poor judgment and increasing paranoia[^41]. Chen Gong, the brilliant strategist who had helped him seize Yan Province, repeatedly offered sound strategic advice that Lü Bu ignored, often making impulsive decisions based on personal pride or short-term considerations. During the siege of Xiapi, Chen Gong proposed breaking out with cavalry forces to attack Cao Cao's supply lines, a strategy that might have succeeded given Lü Bu's cavalry superiority, but Lü Bu refused, unwilling to leave the fortress[^42]. His wife's interference in military decisions further demonstrated Lü Bu's weakness in maintaining proper boundaries between personal and professional domains.

Contemporary sources criticized Lü Bu's excessive drinking and susceptibility to flattery, character flaws that undermined his military talents[^43]. His defenders frequently exploited these weaknesses, offering wine and praise to manipulate his decisions. This combination of arrogance and insecurity made him vulnerable to manipulation by those with ulterior motives while alienating genuinely loyal subordinates who offered honest counsel.

The historical assessment of Lü Bu's moral character remained consistently negative across dynasties[^44]. Confucian historians emphasized how his violations of fundamental virtues—loyalty, filial piety, and trustworthiness—outweighed his martial accomplishments. The phrase "Lü Bu among men, Red Hare among horses" became a Chinese idiom acknowledging his supreme martial abilities while implicitly referencing the moral criticism surrounding his character[^45]. The coupling of his name with his horse subtly suggested that like a beast, Lü Bu lacked the moral reasoning expected of a true hero.

Lü Bu's final surrender and plea for mercy before Cao Cao revealed what critics saw as cowardice unbecoming of his warrior reputation[^46]. After capture, rather than accepting death with dignity, Lü Bu proposed serving Cao Cao, even suggesting that together they could conquer the realm. This desperate bid for survival, coupled with his accusation of Liu Bei standing beside Cao Cao (asking "Is this man not also a backstabber?"), demonstrated a complete lack of self-awareness regarding his own moral failings[^47]. His death by strangulation and beheading was seen by many as just punishment for his betrayals.

---

## Personal Life

Lü Bu's personal life was characterized by a complex web of relationships that reflected both his charisma and his character flaws[^48]. He was married to a woman whose family name was recorded as either Yan or Cao in various sources, though historical records provide limited details about her background[^49]. This primary wife was known for being strong-willed and allegedly exerted considerable influence over Lü Bu's decisions, particularly during the siege of Xiapi when she reportedly discouraged him from accepting Chen Gong's strategic advice to break out with cavalry forces[^50].

The most famous romantic story associated with Lü Bu involves Diaochan, one of the Four Beauties of ancient China, though historians debate the authenticity of this relationship[^51]. According to the popular narrative preserved in Romance of the Three Kingdoms and earlier storytelling traditions, Diaochan was a singing girl in Wang Yun's household who was used as part of a "chain stratagems" plot to create enmity between Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu. The story portrays an affair between Lü Bu and Diaochan, who was officially Dong Zhuo's concubine, which contributed to Lü Bu's decision to assassinate his adoptive father[^52]. However, contemporary historical records from the Three Kingdoms period do not mention Diaochan by name, and many scholars believe this romantic element was a later fictional addition to explain or dramatize Lü Bu's motivations for killing Dong Zhuo[^53].

Historical sources do confirm that Lü Bu had a daughter who played a role in political negotiations[^54]. In 198 CE, before the final siege of Xiapi, Lü Bu arranged for his daughter to marry Yuan Shu's son as part of an alliance agreement, though this marriage alliance ultimately failed to materialize due to intervention by Liu Bei and deteriorating circumstances[^55]. This episode demonstrates Lü Bu's attempts to use familial connections for political advantage, a common practice among warlords of the period.

Lü Bu's personality combined remarkable physical courage with emotional volatility and poor impulse control[^56]. Historical accounts describe him as susceptible to flattery and easily angered when contradicted, traits that his enemies and even subordinates exploited. His enjoyment of alcohol was frequently noted, and several critical decisions were reportedly made while he was intoxicated[^57]. These personal weaknesses undermined the advantages provided by his military genius and contributed to his eventual downfall.

Despite his reputation for betrayal in political relationships, Lü Bu apparently commanded genuine personal loyalty from his elite cavalry troops, who fought fiercely for him throughout his career[^58]. This suggests he possessed considerable personal charisma and leadership qualities in military contexts, even if he lacked the broader political skills necessary for sustained success as a warlord. His relationship with his famous Red Hare horse was legendary, and sources suggest he took exceptional care of this prized mount, demonstrating capacity for attachment to those he valued[^59].

Contemporary descriptions emphasized Lü Bu's impressive physical appearance—he was reportedly tall, well-built, and striking in appearance, which complemented his martial prowess and contributed to his commanding presence on the battlefield[^60]. These physical attributes, combined with his unmatched skills in combat, made him a natural focus of attention and contributed to both his military effectiveness and his personal arrogance.

Lü Bu's household during his time as an independent warlord in Xu Province included several concubines in addition to his primary wife, following the practices of wealthy and powerful men of the era[^61]. However, unlike many successful warlords who used marriage alliances strategically to build political networks, Lü Bu's marital connections seemed to provide limited political benefits, reflecting his generally poor diplomatic skills and the distrust other warlords felt toward family alliances with such an unreliable partner[^62].

## Legacy

Lü Bu's legacy in Chinese history and culture represents a unique paradox: reverence for his unmatched martial prowess combined with moral condemnation of his character[^63]. This duality has made him one of the most enduring and complex figures from the Three Kingdoms period, continuing to fascinate audiences nearly two millennia after his death.

In historical literature, Lü Bu became the archetypal example of a warrior whose physical abilities far exceeded his moral development[^64]. Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms established the orthodox historical interpretation that would influence centuries of subsequent scholarship, portraying Lü Bu as a cautionary tale about the insufficiency of martial prowess without loyalty, wisdom, and moral principle[^65]. This assessment was reinforced by later Confucian commentators who used Lü Bu as an exemplar when arguing that virtue must accompany ability for true greatness.

The phrase "人中呂布，馬中赤兔" (Among men, Lü Bu; among horses, Red Hare) became a lasting idiom in Chinese culture, acknowledging his status as the supreme warrior while simultaneously carrying subtle criticism by equating him with his animal mount[^66]. This saying captured the essence of his legacy—unquestioned physical superiority combined with moral deficiency. The idiom remained in use throughout Chinese history and continues in modern Mandarin, demonstrating Lü Bu's lasting cultural impact.

Lü Bu's image underwent significant transformation in popular culture, particularly through the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong[^67]. While maintaining the historical core of his character, the novel dramatized key episodes, added romantic elements like the Diaochan storyline, and emphasized his martial exploits in vivid battle descriptions. This literary treatment established many of the specific details about Lü Bu that became canonical in popular imagination, even when these elements lacked historical verification[^68].

In traditional Chinese opera, Lü Bu became a standard character type, typically portrayed with specific costume elements including distinctive headgear with long pheasant feathers representing his martial prowess[^69]. These operatic portrayals emphasized his fighting abilities while maintaining the moral framework that ultimately condemned his disloyalty. The visual iconography developed in opera influenced subsequent artistic representations across various media.

Lü Bu's military techniques and cavalry tactics influenced military thinking in subsequent periods of Chinese history[^70]. Military treatises occasionally referenced his campaigns as case studies in cavalry warfare, particularly his use of mobility and shock tactics. However, his strategic failures were equally studied as examples of how tactical brilliance cannot compensate for strategic shortsightedness and poor alliance management[^71].

In modern popular culture, Lü Bu has experienced a significant revival and reinterpretation[^72]. The Dynasty Warriors video game series, beginning in 1997, featured Lü Bu as a nearly unbeatable warrior character, introducing him to global audiences and cementing his reputation as the ultimate fighter of the Three Kingdoms era. These games emphasized his martial prowess while downplaying or contextualizing his moral failings, creating a somewhat more sympathetic portrayal than traditional sources[^73]. This has led to increased interest in the historical Lü Bu among international audiences.

Contemporary Chinese popular culture, including television series, films, and novels, has offered increasingly nuanced portrayals of Lü Bu, sometimes exploring psychological dimensions of his character and the situational pressures of the chaotic late Han period[^74]. Some modern interpretations present him as a tragic figure whose talents were wasted due to character flaws and the impossibility of maintaining honor in a fundamentally dishonorable age, though these revisionist readings remain controversial[^75].

Lü Bu's legacy in military history extends beyond China—his cavalry tactics and the principle of concentrated shock action by elite mounted forces influenced military thinking across East Asia[^76]. Japanese military historians during the medieval period studied accounts of Lü Bu's campaigns when developing their own cavalry doctrines, though they typically emphasized the importance of loyalty that Lü Bu lacked[^77].

In academic scholarship, Lü Bu serves as a case study for examining the tension between Confucian moral ideals and the practical realities of military power during periods of dynastic collapse[^78]. Historians have used his career to analyze how individual agency operated within the systemic breakdown of the Han Dynasty, and how personal character interacted with structural forces to shape historical outcomes[^79]. His life raises enduring questions about whether moral principles can or should constrain action during existential struggles for survival and power.

The archaeological site believed to be Lü Bu's execution location in Xiapi (modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province) has become a minor tourist attraction, with local museums featuring exhibits about the Three Kingdoms period that prominently include Lü Bu's story[^80]. This demonstrates how his legacy continues to generate interest and economic value in contemporary China, nearly 2,000 years after his death.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite overwhelming moral criticism, some historical voices have offered qualified praise for Lü Bu's exceptional abilities and acknowledged the contextual factors that shaped his career[^81]. Modern military historians recognize Lü Bu as arguably the most talented cavalry commander of the late Han period, whose tactical innovations and personal combat skills represented the pinnacle of mounted warfare in Chinese history[^82]. His ability to consistently defeat or stalemate opponents despite limited resources and diplomatic isolation demonstrates genuine military genius that transcended mere physical prowess.

Some scholars have argued that Lü Bu's betrayals, while morally indefensible by Confucian standards, were rational responses to the complete breakdown of traditional social and political structures during the late Han collapse[^83]. In this interpretation, Lü Bu's actions reflected the harsh realities of survival in an era when even the nominal emperor was a powerless puppet and when loyalty to doomed masters meant death. Historian Rafe de Crespigny noted that while Lü Bu's character was flawed, he operated in a period when "traditional values had lost much of their meaning" and when "powerful men throughout the empire were engaged in similar betrayals"[^84].

Zhang Liao, one of the most respected generals of the Three Kingdoms period, served under Lü Bu and maintained a degree of respect for his former commander even after entering Cao Cao's service[^85]. Zhang Liao's success as a military leader has led some historians to suggest that Lü Bu possessed genuine leadership abilities and tactical knowledge that he successfully transmitted to subordinates, complicating the purely negative assessment of his character[^86]. If Lü Bu were simply a brutish fighter without broader military understanding, they argue, he could not have commanded the loyalty of talented officers like Zhang Liao and Chen Gong.

Some modern Chinese scholars have suggested that Lü Bu's northern frontier background placed him at a cultural disadvantage in the Confucian-dominated political environment of the Han court[^87]. His emphasis on martial prowess over literary accomplishment and his direct, action-oriented approach to problems reflected frontier military culture rather than moral deficiency. In this view, Lü Bu was judged by standards shaped by a Confucian elite that valued loyalty and hierarchy above all, but these standards had become increasingly dysfunctional and hypocritical during the late Han period when the same elite engaged in constant political backstabbing[^88].

The legendary "Shooting the Ji" incident has been interpreted by some scholars as evidence that Lü Bu occasionally sought non-violent solutions to conflicts and possessed a sense of showmanship that could reduce bloodshed[^89]. While he certainly engaged in brutal warfare, this episode suggests a more complex character capable of creative problem-solving and theatrical gestures that preserved life. His successful arbitration between Liu Bei and Ji Ling, at least temporarily, demonstrated capacities beyond simple martial aggression.

Recent archaeological and historical research has revealed that Xu Province experienced relative stability during Lü Bu's governance from 196-198 CE, with economic activity and agricultural production maintaining reasonable levels despite the broader chaos afflicting northern China[^90]. This suggests Lü Bu possessed some administrative competence and provided effective protection against bandits and rival warlords, challenging the portrayal of him as purely destructive. Local records from the Xuzhou region occasionally reference this period with less hostility than might be expected given Lü Bu's historical reputation[^91].

Some literary critics and cultural historians have argued that Lü Bu's enduring fascination in Chinese culture stems from his representation of human complexity—a figure whose extraordinary gifts were undermined by very human flaws[^92]. In this interpretation, Lü Bu serves as a more honest representation of human nature than the impossibly virtuous heroes often celebrated in Confucian literature. His failures resonate because they reflect recognizable human weaknesses: pride, impulsiveness, inability to trust, and preference for short-term gains over long-term strategy[^93].

Contemporary scholars of military ethics have occasionally used Lü Bu as a case study for discussing the distinction between tactical and strategic intelligence, arguing that his career demonstrates how battlefield brilliance cannot compensate for failures in the broader political and moral dimensions of leadership[^94]. While this ultimately represents a critical assessment, it acknowledges the genuine excellence of his tactical abilities and uses his career constructively for modern military education.

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among traditional Chinese historians condemned Lü Bu as among the worst examples of moral failure in Chinese history, with his betrayals of adoptive fathers constituting unforgivable violations of core Confucian principles[^95]. Chen Shou's characterization of Lü Bu as having "the courage of a tiger but the mind of a wolf" established a canonical interpretation that depicted him as fundamentally bestial, lacking the moral reasoning that separated civilized humans from animals[^96]. This assessment was echoed and amplified by commentators across subsequent dynasties.

Pei Songzhi, the 5th-century commentator on the Records of the Three Kingdoms, added extensive annotations that further emphasized Lü Bu's moral deficiencies, collecting various sources that illustrated his treachery, poor judgment, and ultimate failure[^97]. Pei's commentary established that whatever Lü Bu's physical abilities, his lack of loyalty (忠), righteousness (義), and wisdom (智) disqualified him from being considered a true hero in the Confucian tradition. This scholarly consensus shaped how educated Chinese understood Lü Bu for over a millennium[^98].

Historical critics have emphasized that Lü Bu's betrayals were not forced by circumstances but represented active choices motivated by greed and ambition[^99]. Unlike subordinates who turned against tyrannical or failing masters as a last resort, Lü Bu murdered benefactors who had treated him well—both Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo had elevated him, granted him high positions, and treated him as an adopted son. His betrayals were therefore seen as especially heinous because they violated reciprocal obligations and demonstrated a fundamental inability to feel gratitude or maintain human bonds[^100].

Cao Cao's decision to execute Lü Bu rather than recruit him, despite Lü Bu's obvious military value, has been interpreted by historians as a moral judgment on the impossibility of trusting such a figure[^101]. Liu Bei's interjection during Lü Bu's plea for mercy—reminding Cao Cao of how Lü Bu had betrayed Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo—represented the consensus view among the warlords of the period that Lü Bu's pattern of betrayal made him too dangerous to employ regardless of his abilities[^102]. This episode demonstrated that even in the ruthlessly pragmatic environment of the Three Kingdoms period, Lü Bu's untrustworthiness exceeded acceptable bounds.

Military historians have criticized Lü Bu's strategic failures, arguing that his tactical successes were ultimately meaningless because of his inability to consolidate gains or build sustainable power[^103]. Despite controlling wealthy territories at various points and commanding elite military forces, Lü Bu never developed the administrative systems, alliance networks, or subordinate loyalty that characterized successful warlords like Cao Cao or Liu Bei. His focus on immediate martial glory at the expense of long-term planning exemplified a fundamental strategic incompetence that no amount of tactical brilliance could overcome[^104].

Contemporary sources recorded multiple instances where Lü Bu's poor judgment and impulsiveness undermined his position[^105]. His refusal to follow Chen Gong's sound strategic advice during the Xiapi siege, his failure to properly manage relations with Liu Bei despite their temporary alliance, and his mishandling of the attempted marriage alliance with Yuan Shu all demonstrated a pattern of self-destructive decision-making. Critics have argued that these failures stemmed from character flaws—arrogance, suspicion, and inability to accept counsel—rather than simply bad luck[^106].

Confucian moralists emphasized how Lü Bu's career exemplified the ultimate futility of prowess without virtue[^107]. Despite being acknowledged as the supreme warrior of his age, Lü Bu died in failure and disgrace, his territory conquered, his subordinates scattered or turned against him, and his name synonymous with treachery. This outcome was interpreted as demonstrating cosmic justice—that Heaven ultimately punishes those who violate fundamental moral principles regardless of their abilities[^108]. His failure served as a cautionary tale reinforcing Confucian values in countless subsequent historical commentaries and popular stories.

Literary critics have noted that even Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which often romanticizes historical figures and adds heroic elements, maintains the essential moral condemnation of Lü Bu while expanding his martial exploits[^109]. The novel portrays him as magnificent in battle but ultimately pathetic in his downfall, weeping and begging for mercy in a manner that diminishes his warrior image. This treatment suggests that even popular culture, which might have transformed Lü Bu into a tragic hero, found his moral failures too fundamental to redeem[^110].

Modern psychological and historical analyses have described Lü Bu as potentially suffering from personality disorders characterized by inability to form stable attachments, grandiosity, and lack of empathy[^111]. While applying modern psychiatric categories to historical figures is methodologically problematic, these analyses attempt to explain the consistency of his self-destructive patterns and his apparent inability to learn from repeated failures. Such interpretations, while more clinical than moral in language, ultimately reach similar conclusions about his fundamental unsuitability for leadership[^112].

The historical consensus that Lü Bu represented a cautionary tale rather than a model has remained remarkably stable across nearly two millennia, surviving changes in dynasty, ideology, and cultural values[^113]. This persistence suggests that his story touches on fundamental human concerns about the relationship between power and morality, the insufficiency of talent without character, and the self-destructive nature of betrayal. His legacy as a negative example has arguably been more influential than many positive exemplars precisely because his failures were so dramatic and his character flaws so recognizable[^114].
