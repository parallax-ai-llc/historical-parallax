## Overview

In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted with the thermal energy of 100,000 Hiroshima bombs, obliterating the Roman resort towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. It remains one of the most famous disasters in history, not just for the scale of destruction, but for the haunting preservation of the moment. The heavy blanket of ash hermetically sealed the city, freezing its inhabitants in their final moments—eating, sleeping, or fleeing with their jewelry—providing an unparalleled snapshot of Roman daily life that would not be touched for 1,500 years.

## The Warning Signs

The Romans did not realize Vesuvius was a volcano. It had been dormant for centuries, its slopes covered in fertile vineyards.
**62 AD Earthquake:** A massive earthquake struck the region 17 years earlier, damaging many buildings. Repairs were still ongoing when the eruption hit.
**The Days Before:** Wells dried up. Minor earth tremors occurred. Pliny the Younger later wrote that "the earth was not just shaking, but turning over."

## The Timeline of Doom (August 24-25, 79 AD)

### 1:00 PM: The Plinian Phase
A massive column of ash and pumice shot **20 miles** into the stratosphere.
It looked like a "Pinus" (umbrella pine) tree.
**The Rain of Stone:**
For hours, lapilli (small porous stones) rained down on Pompeii. It wasn't hot enough to kill yet, but roofs began to collapse under the weight. Many residents fled; others stayed to guard their homes.

### Midnight: The Pyroclastic Surges
The column collapsed.
**Surge 1 & 2:** Hit Herculaneum. Superheated gas/mud (500°C) moving at 100 mph instantly vaporized the brains and flesh of people hiding in the boat houses.
**Surge 3 - 6:** The following morning, the surges reached Pompeii.
This was the killer. The heat was lower (~250°C), but it resulted in "thermal shock." People died instantly, their muscles contracting in the famous "pugilist pose." They were then buried in fine ash.

## Pliny the Elder & Younger

**Pliny the Elder:** The famous naturalist and admiral of the Roman fleet at Misenum. He sailed *towards* the danger to rescue friends ("Fortune favors the brave"). He died on the beach at Stabiae, overcome by fumes (or a heart attack).
**Pliny the Younger:** His nephew, who stayed behind, wrote the only eyewitness account in letters to historian Tacitus.

## The Resurrections (Archaeology)

Rediscovered in 1748.
**The Plaster Casts:**
In 1863, archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli realized the voids in the hardened ash were where bodies had decomposed. He injected Paris plaster into the voids.
When the ash was chipped away, the detailed forms of the victims were revealed—facial expressions, clothing folds, even chained dogs.
**Graffiti:**
Walls were covered in preserved messages:
*"Satura was here."*
*"I wonder, O wall, that you have not yet collapsed, so many writers' clichés have you borne."*
Prices of wine, election slogans, and insults.
