## Overview

The Donghak Peasant Revolution (동학농민운동) was a massive anti-feudal, anti-foreign uprising in Korea in 1894. Led by Jeon Bong-jun (전봉준) and organized around the Donghak religious movement, peasants demanded social reforms, the end of corrupt governance, and resistance to foreign intervention. The rebellion ultimately led to foreign intervention that sparked the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), transforming Korean and East Asian history.

## Background

### Late Joseon Dynasty Corruption

**Structural Problems:**
- Extreme yangban (aristocratic) exploitation
- Heavy taxation on peasants
- Corrupt local magistrates
- Land concentration
- Foreign economic pressure (unequal treaties)

**Famine and Hardship:**
Late 19th century saw repeated famines and suffering in southern provinces.

### Donghak Movement

**Founded (1860):**
Choe Je-u (최제우) created Donghak ("Eastern Learning") as indigenous Korean religion blending Confucianism, Buddhism, Shamanism.

**Egalitarian Message:**
- "Human beings are heaven" (人乃天)
- Social equality
- Reject Western influence
- Nationalism

**Persecution:**
Government suppressed Donghak as heresy. Choe Je-u executed (1864). Movement went underground but grew.

## First Uprising (Early 1894)

### Gobu Uprising (January 1894)

**Trigger:**
Jo Byeong-gap, corrupt magistrate of Gobu County, imposed illegal taxes and built reservoir using forced labor, then charged farmers to use it.

**Jeon Bong-jun (전봉준):**
Local teacher, Donghak leader. Led 1,000 peasants to seize Gobu county office (January 11, 1894).

**Nickname:** "Green Pea General" (녹두장군) - small but formidable.

### Government Response

Government sent forces and new magistrate. Jeon briefly retreated.

### Baeksan Gathering (April 1894)

Larger uprising organized. 8,000 peasants gathered at Baeksan, issued demands:
- Remove corrupt officials
- End aristocratic privileges
- Land reform
- Reject foreign influence

### Military Success

**Battle of Hwangnyongchon (April 7):**
Peasant army defeated government forces.

**Jeonju Captured (May 31):**

## Foreign Intervention

### Joseon Requests Chinese Aid

Government asked China (Qing Dynasty) for military assistance under 1885 Tianjin Convention.

### Japan Sends Troops

Convention required notification; Japan claimed right to send equal forces to "protect Japanese nationals."

**Both Powers Refused to Withdraw:**
After Donghak threat subsided, neither China nor Japan left.

**First Sino-Japanese War (July 1894):**
Provoked by power struggle in Korea. Japan decisively defeated China.

## Treaty of Jeonju (June 1894)

**Ceasefire:**
Government agreed to reforms; peasant army withdrew.

**Jipgangso (集講所):**
Local self-government bodies established in liberated areas. Implemented reforms:
- Corrupt officials punished
- Slaves freed
- Land redistribution
- Tax reform

This brief period showed what peasant-led Korea might look like.

## Second Uprising (October-December 1894)

### Japanese Takeover

After Sino-Japanese War began, Japan effectively controlled Korean government. Pro-Japanese reforms imposed.

### Renewed Rebellion

**Anti-Japanese:**
Donghak forces rearmed. Goal shifted to expelling Japanese.

**Coalition:**
Joined by conservative yangban forces (strange alliance against common enemy).

### Battle of Ugeumchi (November 1894)

Modern weapons (rifles, artillery) devastated peasants with swords and muskets.
