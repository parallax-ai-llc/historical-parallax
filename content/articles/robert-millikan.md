## Summary

Robert Millikan was an American experimental physicist who won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physics for his measurement of the elementary electric charge and work on the photoelectric effect. His oil-drop experiment precisely determined the charge of an electron. He also verified Einstein's photoelectric equation and determined Planck's constant. Millikan served as president of Caltech from 1921 to 1945.
