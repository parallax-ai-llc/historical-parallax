## Overview

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake—the largest ever recorded in Japan—triggered a massive tsunami that overwhelmed the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant's defenses. With cooling systems knocked out, three of six reactors melted down. Hydrogen explosions destroyed reactor buildings. Japan scrambled to prevent catastrophe while 154,000 evacuated. Though direct radiation deaths were minimal, the disaster killed 2,200+ through evacuation stress. It led Japan to shut down all 54 nuclear reactors and transformed global nuclear policy, demonstrating that even the most technologically advanced nation could not fully protect against nuclear disaster.

## Background

### The Great East Japan Earthquake

**March 11, 2011, 2:46 PM:**
9.0-magnitude megathrust earthquake struck off Pacific coast of Tōhoku region.

**Epicenter:** 130 km east of Sendai, 29 km deep

**The Earthquake:**
- 4th largest in recorded history
- Shifted Japan 2.4 meters east
- Dropped coastline by 0.6 meters
- Triggered devastating tsunami

### The Tsunami

**Waves:** Up to 40.5 meters (133 feet) in some areas
**Speed:** 700 km/h across ocean
**Devastation:** 20,000+ killed overall

---

## Fukushima Daiichi

### The Plant

**Owner:** Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)
**Location:** Ōkuma/Futaba, Fukushima Prefecture
**Reactors:** 6 (boiling water reactors)
- Reactors 1-3: Operating
- Reactor 4: Defueled for maintenance
- Reactors 5-6: Shut down for maintenance

**Design:** General Electric Mark I containment (1960s design)

### Vulnerability

**Seawall:** 5.7 meters
**Actual tsunami:** 14+ meters

Plant was woefully unprepared for tsunami of this magnitude despite warnings.

---

## The Disaster

### March 11

**2:46 PM:** Earthquake hits. Reactors 1-3 automatically shut down (SCRAM). External power lost.

**3:27 PM:** Tsunami warning issued.

**3:35 PM:** First tsunami waves hit. 14-meter waves overwhelm seawall.

**3:41 PM:** Second, larger wave hits. Flooding destroys:
- Emergency diesel generators
- Electrical switching equipment
- Cooling pumps

**Station Blackout:**
All power lost. Cooling stopped. Decay heat from fuel rods began melting reactor cores.

### Meltdowns

**Reactor 1:**
- Core melted within hours
- Hydrogen accumulated
- March 12, 3:36 PM: Hydrogen explosion destroyed reactor building

**Reactor 3:**
- Also melted down
- March 14, 11:01 AM: Massive hydrogen explosion (mushroom cloud)

**Reactor 2:**
- Melted down
- March 15: Explosion damaged suppression chamber

**Reactor 4:**
- Not operating but spent fuel pool threatened
- March 15: Explosion (likely hydrogen from Reactor 3)

## Emergency Response

### TEPCO and Government

**Confusion:**
Communication failures between TEPCO, government, and plant.

**Prime Minister Kan:**
Naoto Kan flew to plant personally. Criticized for interfering; later praised for preventing full evacuation that would have abandoned plant.

### "Fukushima 50"

**Heroes:**
Plant workers who stayed amid explosions, radiation. Rotated in small groups. Became symbols of sacrifice.

**Water Injection:**
Seawater (and later freshwater) pumped into reactors to cool melted fuel. Unprecedented, desperate measure.

### Military Helicopters

**Water Drops:**
Self-Defense Forces helicopters dropped water on reactors—largely ineffective but dramatic images.

---

## Evacuation

### Zones

**March 11:** 3 km evacuation
**March 12:** 10 km, then 20 km
**Later:** 30 km shelter-in-place, then expanded

**154,000 Evacuated:**
Many forced to flee with little notice. Elderly, hospital patients particularly vulnerable.

**Evacuation Deaths:**
2,202+ deaths attributed to stress, disrupted medical care, suicide during evacuation—far more than radiation.

---

## Radiation Release

### Contamination

**Amount:** ~15% of Chernobyl release
**Direction:** Mostly carried out to sea (luck of wind direction)

**Affected Areas:**
- Northwest corridor heavily contaminated
- Some areas remain uninhabitable

### Health Effects

**Confirmed Radiation Deaths:** 1 (worker who developed cancer, acknowledged 2018)
**Thyroid Screenings:** Elevated thyroid abnormalities in children—debate whether radiation-caused or overdiagnosis

**Long-Term:**
WHO projects small increase in cancer rates. Psychological impacts (stress, anxiety) significant.

---

## Aftermath

### Decommissioning

**40-Year Process:**
- Melted fuel (corium) location mapped using muon imaging
- Removing melted fuel: Enormous challenge
- Technology doesn't yet exist for some tasks
- Contaminated water storage: 1.3+ million tons

**Cost:** Estimated $200+ billion

### Exclusion Zone

**Some Areas Reopened:**
Decontamination ongoing. Some former residents returned.

**Ghost Towns:**
Many zones remain empty; wildlife has returned.

### Contaminated Water

**Controversy (2021-2023):**
Japan announced plans to release treated (but tritium-containing) water into Pacific. China, Korea protested.

---

## Impact on Nuclear Policy

### Japan

**All Reactors Shut Down:**
54 reactors eventually stopped. Energy costs soared. Some have restarted under stricter rules.

### Global

**Germany:** Announced phase-out of nuclear power
**Switzerland, Belgium:** Similar decisions
**China, India:** Continued expansion with enhanced safety
