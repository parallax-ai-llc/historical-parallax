## Summary

Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme (1778-1842) was a Chilean independence leader who freed Chile from Spanish rule and is widely regarded as the "George Washington of Chile."[^1] As the illegitimate son of an Irish-Spanish viceroy, he rose to become Chile's second Supreme Director (1817-1823) and the first to head a fully independent Chilean state.[^2] A reformer and idealist, he was the first national leader in the Americas to abolish black slavery, though his authoritarian governance style and radical reforms ultimately led to his forced resignation and exile in Peru, where he died in 1842.[^3] Despite controversies during his rule, O'Higgins remains celebrated as one of Chile's founding fathers, with his legacy visible throughout the nation today.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Bernardo O'Higgins was born on August 20, 1778, in Chillán, Chile, though some sources suggest the year may have been 1776.[^5] He was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O'Higgins, 1st Marquis of Osorno, a Spanish officer born in County Sligo, Ireland, who would rise to become governor of Chile and later viceroy of Peru.[^6] His mother was Isabel Riquelme, a prominent local woman and the daughter of Don Simón Riquelme y Goycolea, a member of the Chillán Cabildo, or town council.[^7]

O'Higgins spent his early years with his mother's family in central-southern Chile and was never acknowledged by his father.[^8] He had a distant relationship with Ambrosio, who supported him financially and was concerned with his education, but the two never met in person.[^9] At age ten, he was separated from his mother when he was taken to Lima to start his education.[^10] He later lived with the Albano family, who were his father's commercial partners, in Talca.[^11]

At age fifteen, O'Higgins was sent to Lima by his father to attend the exclusive San Carlos College.[^12] At seventeen, Bernardo O'Higgins was sent to London to complete his studies, where he studied history and the arts and became acquainted with American ideas of independence.[^13] In London, he developed a sense of nationalist pride and met Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan idealist and believer in independence.[^14] He joined the Lautaro Lodge, a non-masonic secret society established in London by Miranda, the members of which were dedicated to the independence of Latin America.[^15]

In 1798, O'Higgins went to Spain from Great Britain, his return to the Americas delayed by the French Revolutionary Wars.[^16] His father died in 1801, leaving O'Higgins a large piece of land, the Hacienda Las Canteras, near the Chilean city of Los Ángeles.[^17] O'Higgins returned to Chile in 1802, adopted his biological father's surname, and began life as a gentleman farmer, using his mother's surname until the death of his father.[^18]

## Rise to Power

On September 18, 1810, O'Higgins joined the revolt against the now French-dominated Spanish government, marking the beginning of Chile's struggle for independence.[^19] The anti-Royalist camp in Chile was deeply split along lines of patronage and personality, political beliefs, and geography, particularly between the rival regional groupings of Santiago and Concepción.[^20] O'Higgins quickly emerged as a military leader during the early phase of Chile's independence struggle, known as the Patria Vieja (1810-1814).[^21]

However, this period was marked by intense rivalry between O'Higgins and José Miguel Carrera, who enjoyed a power base in Santiago while O'Higgins' lay in Concepción.[^22] The Carrera family had already seized power several times in different coups and supported a specifically Chilean nationalism, as opposed to the broader Latin American focus of the Lautaro Lodge grouping, which included O'Higgins and the Argentine José de San Martín.[^23]

At the Battle of El Roble in 1814, Bernardo managed to fight back and win even though Carrera fled the field.[^24] O'Higgins' decisive actions during the battle resulted in his promotion to colonel.[^25] However, their forces later met at the Battle of Las Tres Acequias, where Carrera's brother Luis inflicted a modest defeat on O'Higgins.[^26]

The defining moment came at the Battle of Rancagua on October 1-2, 1814, when the Spanish Army under Mariano Osorio defeated the Chilean forces led by O'Higgins.[^27] O'Higgins desperately called for José Miguel Carrera's division, still north of Rancagua, but Carrera either betrayed O'Higgins or O'Higgins did not understand the coded message Carrera sent him.[^28] From the bell tower of Rancagua's church, O'Higgins saw Carrera's division advancing and then turning around and leaving.[^29] The battle ended in stunning defeat for the independence forces, of which only 500 of the original 5,000 survived, though O'Higgins managed to break out with a few of his men.[^30]

O'Higgins retreated to Argentina with the survivors and remained there for three years while the royalists were in control.[^31] While in exile, O'Higgins met the Argentine General José de San Martín, and together the men planned to return to Chile in 1817 to defeat the royalists.[^32] On February 12, 1817, at the Battle of Chacabuco, they decisively defeated the Spanish forces.[^33] O'Higgins' audacious cavalry charge secured victory at Chacabuco.[^34] Four days later, on February 16, 1817, in Santiago, he was appointed Supreme Director of Chile and granted dictatorial powers.[^35]

## Major Achievements

As Supreme Director, O'Higgins maintained, on balance, a successful administration for the next six years.[^36] He created a working governmental organization and provided the essentials of the new nation—peace and order.[^37] On February 12, 1818, the first anniversary of the Battle of Chacabuco, O'Higgins formally proclaimed Chile an independent republic, presenting a meticulously prepared declaration affirming Chile's independence as a sovereign nation.[^38] The Chilean Declaration of Independence was drafted in January 1818 and approved by Supreme Director Bernardo O'Higgins on February 12, 1818 at Talca.[^39]

One of O'Higgins' most significant achievements was the establishment of the Chilean Navy. He organized the first Chilean Navy under the command of Lord Thomas Cochrane, a Scottish naval officer, and Manuel Blanco Encalada.[^40] O'Higgins joined San Martín in acquiring a flotilla of ships, which were presented to Cochrane, who created a Chilean fleet that was superior to anything operating in the Southern Pacific region.[^41] This naval squadron broke royalist naval power and prepared the way for the invasion of Peru, establishing the First Chilean Navy Squadron, the Academy for Young Midshipmen, and the Chilean Marine Corps.[^42] Under adverse circumstances, he succeeded in building a national navy and mounting a major military expedition against Peru to fight the royalists.[^43]

O'Higgins was a reformer and an idealist who was the first national leader in the Americas to abolish black slavery, though complete abolition succeeded only after surmounting many obstacles.[^44] In 1811, the first Chilean congress had abolished slavery, but such a measure had only affected sons of slaves born in Chile and persons who were enslaved when they arrived in the country.[^45] O'Higgins worked to complete this process during his administration.

His six-year rule saw the founding of the Chilean Military Academy in 1817 to professionalize the officer corps and the approval of the new (and current) Chilean flag.[^46] He set out to "eliminate some exclusive, aristocratic institutions while raising the cultural level of the common people."[^47] To spread learning and culture, he established the National Library, encouraged printing, and supported an education system based on an English model.[^48] He founded markets, courts, colleges, libraries, hospitals, and cemeteries, laying the groundwork for a structured and functional society.[^49]

O'Higgins implemented significant social reforms, including the abolition of titles of nobility and the public display of coats of arms.[^50] He completed the San Carlos Canal, a public works project dating from colonial times and designed to irrigate the land to the south of Santiago.[^51] After the victory over Royalist forces, O'Higgins promulgated the Provisional Constitution for the Chilean State in 1818, which had 143 articles regulating rights and responsibilities of men in society, freedom, equality, and property rights, enshrining advanced social principles for the period.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, O'Higgins' rule was marked by significant controversies that ultimately led to his downfall. His authoritarian approach, radical reforms, and centralization of power alienated influential groups such as landowners, the Catholic Church, and businesspeople.[^53] The provinces increasingly viewed him as centralizing power to an excessive degree.[^54] The federalists opposed his authoritarianism, and the landed aristocracy viewed with suspicion the reforms he implemented.[^55]

In 1822, O'Higgins established a new "controversial" constitution via a handpicked constituent convention, which many regarded as a desperate attempt to hang on to power and was perceived as an attempt to consolidate power, leading to accusations of authoritarianism.[^56] This constitution established a strong executive with appointed senators and a legislature of limited efficacy, effectively enabling governance by decree and curtailing opposition voices in legislative bodies.[^57]

The deaths of his political enemies, including Carrera and Manuel Rodríguez, returned to haunt him, with some accusing him of abusing state power.[^58] The assassination of guerrilla leader Manuel Rodríguez on May 26, 1818, by government forces remains particularly controversial.[^59] Rodríguez, a key independence figure who had become hugely popular, had shifted to criticizing O'Higgins' consolidation of power.[^60] After being imprisoned by order of O'Higgins, Rodríguez was killed in Til-Til by soldiers of the "Cazadores de los Andes" battalion commanded by Antonio Navarro.[^61]

The official report was that Rodríguez had attempted to escape, forcing the guards to shoot him in the back.[^62] However, a nearby farmer saw the events unfold and claimed that one of the guards had invited Rodríguez to take a stroll and, during the walk, the other guards shot Rodríguez in the back.[^63] The officers involved would later confirm the farmer's testimony.[^64] O'Higgins claimed that he had no responsibility for the killing, which had been carried out by soldiers, but never fully managed to prove that he had not ordered it.[^65] This has been regarded as the first political assassination in Chilean history.[^66]

By 1820, O'Higgins had antagonized the conservative church and the unruly aristocracy with his reforms.[^67] By late 1822, growing discontent with O'Higgins' centralizing reforms, perceived authoritarianism, and economic policies fueled provincial revolts, notably in Concepción under Ramón Freire and in La Serena, threatening national fragmentation.[^68] By the time of his resignation under pressure in January 1823, a growing Chilean nationalism had rendered him and his Argentine colleagues much less attractive than they had been in 1817.[^69] O'Higgins was deposed by a conservative coup on January 28, 1823.[^70]

## Personal Life

Bernardo O'Higgins was born as the illegitimate son of Isabel Riquelme and Ambrosio O'Higgins, who later became governor of Chile and viceroy of Peru.[^71] He was separated from his mother at age ten when he was taken to Lima to start his education.[^72] Throughout his life, O'Higgins maintained a complex relationship with his family heritage, being the son of an Irish father who never acknowledged him and a Chilean mother from whom he was separated at a young age.[^73]

O'Higgins himself had an illegitimate son, Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins (1817-1868).[^74] During his exile in Peru from 1823 until his death, O'Higgins lived accompanied by Pedro Demetrio, his mother Isabel Riquelme, and his half-sister, Rosa Rodríguez Riquelme (1781-1850).[^75] This family arrangement provided him with companionship during his years away from Chile.

Because he was the illegitimate son of the "English viceroy" and not a born member of the landed aristocracy, even his own countrymen were divided in accepting him as a national hero during his lifetime.[^76] His personality was marked by a dedication to democratic ideals despite his authoritarian governance methods. As he himself admitted, "I know nothing of these torturous arts by which a man may aspire to govern a state torn by envy, parties, and factions."[^77]

O'Higgins' final years were spent in Peru. In 1842, the National Congress of Chile finally voted to allow O'Higgins to return to Chile, and the Manuel Bulnes government restored his rank and emoluments, news of which reached O'Higgins shortly before his death.[^78] After travelling to Callao to embark for Chile, however, O'Higgins began to succumb to cardiac problems and was too weak to travel.[^79] His doctor ordered him to return to Lima, where on October 24, 1842, aged 64, O'Higgins died.[^80] His remains were first buried in Peru before being repatriated to Chile in 1869.[^81] O'Higgins had wished to be buried in the city of Concepción, but this was never to be.[^82]

## Legacy

Bernardo O'Higgins' legacy in Chile is profound and enduring. He is widely commemorated today throughout the country, with an entire administrative region named Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region in his honor south of Santiago.[^83] Santiago's main thoroughfare is named Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins.[^84] The region's main university and soccer team also bear his name, demonstrating how deeply his legacy is woven into Chilean national identity.[^85]

O'Higgins is widely regarded by Latin Americans as the George Washington of Chile and remains a symbol of national pride and a key figure in the narrative of Chile's quest for independence and self-determination.[^86] His leadership in the Chilean Congress, as a military leader, a diplomat, and as a builder of democratic institutions changed the course of history in his nation.[^87] While his reputation since his death has fluctuated with the political predilections of governments and historians, his leading role in establishing Chile as a republic remains unquestioned.[^88]

The historical assessment of O'Higgins evolved significantly over time. Initially, Bernardo won fame as the liberator of Chile, but he lacked the qualities that would have made him popular as well as respected.[^89] A shift occurred toward the end of the 19th century when many historians began to look at O'Higgins' legacy in a new light.[^90] Unlike other Latin American countries which engaged in very violent civil wars after gaining independence, the time of disorder in Chile after independence was relatively short, and "the idea of order is linked to Bernardo," with O'Higgins becoming revered in Chile as its "founding father."[^91]

His legacy includes significant educational reforms and attempts to modernize Chilean society, though these initiatives were met with resistance during his lifetime.[^92] The institutions he founded—the National Library, the Military Academy, the Chilean Navy, and various educational establishments—continue to serve the nation.[^93] His progressive policies, including being the first national leader in the Americas to abolish black slavery and his abolition of aristocratic titles, marked him as a forward-thinking leader ahead of his time.[^94]

For years, Chilean historians were divided between those who supported Carrera and those who supported O'Higgins, but the Irish-Chilean eventually won out in popular memory.[^95] His complex heritage as the son of an Irish viceroy and a Chilean mother has made him a unique figure in Latin American independence movements, connecting Chile to both European and Latin American revolutionary traditions.[^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars recognize O'Higgins as one of Chile's most important founding fathers who played an indispensable role in securing the nation's independence.[^97] Historians emphasize that unlike other Latin American countries that descended into prolonged civil wars after independence, Chile's relatively stable transition to self-governance was largely due to the institutional foundations O'Higgins established during his rule.[^98] His creation of a working governmental organization that provided peace and order laid the groundwork for Chile's future development.[^99]

Academic assessments praise O'Higgins as a reformer and idealist whose progressive vision extended beyond mere military victory.[^100] His establishment of the Chilean Navy under Lord Cochrane is recognized as a strategic masterstroke that secured Chile's maritime independence and enabled the liberation of Peru.[^101] The founding of the Military Academy in 1817 professionalized the Chilean officer corps and strengthened the nation's defense capabilities for generations to come.[^102]

O'Higgins' social reforms are particularly celebrated by contemporary historians. His abolition of slavery—making him the first national leader in the Americas to do so—his elimination of aristocratic titles, and his establishment of educational institutions based on English models demonstrated a commitment to Enlightenment ideals of equality and progress.[^103] His dedication to spreading learning and culture through the National Library and support for printing marked him as a visionary who understood that national development required educated citizens.[^104]

Defenders of O'Higgins argue that the difficult circumstances of governing a newly independent nation torn by regional rivalries and economic challenges required strong executive authority.[^105] His use of dictatorial powers, while controversial, can be understood as necessary to prevent the nation from fragmenting into warring factions.[^106] The completion of public works projects like the San Carlos Canal and the founding of markets, courts, colleges, hospitals, and cemeteries demonstrated practical governance that improved citizens' lives.[^107]

### Negative Views

Critics of O'Higgins focus on his authoritarian governance style and the concentration of power in the executive branch.[^108] The 1822 constitution, which established a strong executive with appointed senators and a legislature of limited efficacy, is viewed by some historians as an attempt to create a quasi-dictatorship that curtailed democratic participation and opposition voices.[^109] The provinces' complaints about excessive centralization of power in Santiago revealed a leader who failed to balance national unity with regional autonomy.[^110]

The most damaging criticisms concern the deaths of political opponents, particularly the assassination of Manuel Rodríguez in 1818.[^111] Even if O'Higgins did not directly order Rodríguez's killing, his failure to prevent it or adequately investigate it has led scholars to question his commitment to the rule of law.[^112] The deaths of the Carrera brothers and other political enemies created an atmosphere of fear and repression that contradicted O'Higgins' stated commitment to republican ideals.[^113]

Some historians argue that O'Higgins' radical reforms—including the abolition of titles of nobility, attacks on church privileges, and centralization of power—were implemented too hastily without adequate consultation or building political consensus.[^114] His approach alienated powerful constituencies including the Catholic Church, the landed aristocracy, and businesspeople, ultimately making his government unsustainable.[^115] As one scholar noted, "In times of revolution, it is dangerous to carry through fundamental changes suddenly, however reasonable and desirable they may be in themselves."[^116]

O'Higgins' own statements reveal a leader who struggled with the contradictions of his position. His admission that "I know nothing of these torturous arts by which a man may aspire to govern a state torn by envy, parties, and factions" and his confession that "my experience and what scant understanding of politics I possess have convinced me that our peoples will only find well-being under compulsion; but my repugnance for compulsion is so great that I am loath to employ it" suggest a leader fundamentally ill-suited for the political demands of his office.[^117] His final lament, "I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country," reflects the tragedy of a well-intentioned reformer whose methods undermined his goals.[^118]
