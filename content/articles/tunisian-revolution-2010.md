## Overview

The Tunisian Revolution (December 2010 - January 2011), often called the "Jasmine Revolution," was the first and most successful uprising of the Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that swept the Middle East and North Africa. Sparked by the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi on December 17, 2010, mass protests demanded an end to corruption, unemployment, and authoritarian rule under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Within weeks, Ben Ali fled the country—ending 23 years of dictatorship. Tunisia became the only Arab Spring country to successfully transition to democracy, though that progress remains fragile.

## Mohamed Bouazizi

### The Spark

**December 17, 2010:**
Mohamed Bouazizi, 26, vegetable vendor in Sidi Bouzid (interior town), had his cart confiscated by police. Allegedly humiliated by female inspector.

**Self-Immolation:**
Bouazizi set himself on fire in front of government building in protest.

**Death:**
January 4, 2011, Bouazizi died of burns.

### Why It Resonated

Bouazizi's story encapsulated frustrations of millions:
- Educated (some accounts say he had studied)
- Couldn't find work
- Reduced to street vending
- Harassed by corrupt officials
- Dignity stripped

## The Revolution

### Protests Spread

**Sidi Bouzid (December 17-24):**
Local protests began immediately. Police cracked down.

**Expansion:**
- Word spread via Facebook, YouTube
- Al Jazeera broadcast footage
- Protests spread to other interior towns
- Then to major cities

### December 27-January 9

**Escalation:**
- Lawyers' strike
- Student protests
- Professional associations joined
- General strikes in regions

**Violence:**
Police fired on protesters. At least 200+ killed over revolution weeks.

### January 10-14: Final Days

**January 10:**
Ben Ali appeared on TV. Promised reforms, jobs.

**Too Late:**
Protests intensified. Demands shifted to "Dégage!" (Get out!).

**January 13:**
Deadliest day of protests.

**January 14:**
Ben Ali declared state of emergency—then fled to Saudi Arabia.

**Revolution Victorious.**

## Post-Revolution

### Transition

**Interim Government:**
Coalition formed. Promised elections.

### October 2011 Elections

Ennahda (Islamist party) won plurality. Coalition government formed.

### Constitution (2014)

**Democratic Constitution:**
Progressive protections:
- Freedom of speech, religion

## Arab Spring Impact

### Regional Contagion

Tunisia's success inspired:

**Egypt:** Tahrir Square protests; Mubarak fell (February 2011)
**Libya:** Civil war; Gaddafi killed (October 2011)
**Yemen:** Saleh ousted; civil war followed
**Syria:** Protests became devastating civil war (ongoing)
**Bahrain:** Protests crushed

### Contrasting Outcomes

Only Tunisia achieved relatively stable democracy. Others:
- Egypt: Military restored power
- Libya: Ongoing instability
- Syria: 500,000+ dead
- Yemen: Humanitarian catastrophe

## Challenges to Democracy

### Terrorism

**IS Attacks:**
2015: Bardo Museum, Sousse beach. 60+ killed.

**Security Measures:**
State of emergency extended.

### Economic Problems

Unemployment, debt, regional inequality persist. Youth frustration continues.

### Political Crisis (2021)

**President Kais Saied:**
July 2021, suspended parliament, ruled by decree. Critics called it coup. New constitution (2022) concentrated power.

**Democracy in Retreat:**
Tunisia's democratic experiment under threat.
