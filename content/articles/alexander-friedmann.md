## Summary

Alexander Friedmann was a Russian mathematician and physicist who derived the Friedmann equations from Einstein's general relativity, showing that the universe could be expanding. His 1922 paper challenged Einstein's static universe model and laid the mathematical groundwork for the Big Bang theory. Einstein initially dismissed Friedmann's work as erroneous but later acknowledged its correctness. Friedmann died at age 37 from typhoid fever.
