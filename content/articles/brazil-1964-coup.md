## Summary

On April 1, 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew democratically elected President João Goulart, beginning 21 years of dictatorship. The coup, executed with tacit US support during the Cold War, was justified by claims of preventing communism. In reality, it crushed a reformist government and established an authoritarian regime that would torture, kill, and disappear thousands of Brazilians. The 1964 coup shaped Latin America's modern history, providing a template for military interventions across the continent.[^1]

João Goulart—"Jango"—was a moderate leftist whose proposed "base reforms" (land reform, voting rights, nationalization) threatened elite interests. Conservative forces, the military high command, and the United States saw him as dangerously close to communism. When troops moved against him, Goulart chose exile over civil war. Brazil's experiment with populist democracy ended; the "Years of Lead" began.[^2]

## Historical Background

### João Goulart's Presidency

Goulart became president in 1961 under unusual circumstances:

- **1960:** Elected Vice President (ran separately from president)
- **August 1961:** President Jânio Quadros suddenly resigned
- **Military Opposition:** Generals initially blocked Goulart's succession
- **Compromise:** Parliamentary system temporarily limited his powers
- **1963 Referendum:** Restored full presidential powers to Goulart[^3]

### The "Base Reforms"

Goulart proposed ambitious reforms:
- **Land Reform:** Redistribute agricultural land
- **Voting Rights:** Extend vote to illiterates
- **Nationalization:** Take control of foreign-owned oil refineries
- **Education:** Expand public education
- **Political:** Legalize the Communist Party

Conservatives and military saw these as communist infiltration.[^4]

### Cold War Context

**1960s Latin America:**
- Cuban Revolution (1959) alarmed Washington
- US "Alliance for Progress" sought to prevent "another Cuba"
- Military governments seen as bulwarks against communism
- CIA and State Department actively monitored Brazil[^5]

## The Coup

### Conspiracy

By early 1964, a coup was being planned:
- Military commanders conspired openly
- Business elites funded anti-Goulart campaigns
- "March of the Family with God for Liberty" (March 19): 500,000 conservatives protested in São Paulo
- US Ambassador Lincoln Gordon reported favorably on coup prospects

### US Support

**Operation Brother Sam:**
- US Navy task force positioned off Brazil
- Ready to provide logistical support if needed
- Declassified documents confirm US backing[^6]

### March 31 - April 1, 1964

**March 31:** Military units in Minas Gerais began moving against the government

**April 1:** 
- Coup forces advanced on Rio de Janeiro
- Goulart refused to resist militarily to avoid civil war
- Congressional president declared presidency vacant (Goulart was still in Brazil)
- Goulart fled to Uruguay via Porto Alegre

**April 2:** Military took full control

**April 11:** General Castelo Branco became first military president[^7]

---

## Death Toll

**During the coup itself:** Minimal casualties (Goulart chose not to fight)

**During the dictatorship (1964-1985):**
- **Truth Commission (2014):** 434 confirmed killed or disappeared
- **Torture:** Systematic; thousands of victims
- **Indigenous peoples:** Evidence of mass killings
- **Actual totals:** Likely higher; many cases never documented[^8]

## Legacy

- Trauma still unprocessed
- Amnesty without accountability
- Democratic institutions remain fragile

### For Latin America

- Template for Operation Condor coups (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay)
- US Cold War intervention pattern
- "National Security Doctrine" spread across continent

### Continuing Relevance

Brazil's democracy remains haunted by 1964:
- Military continues to play political role
- Some politicians praise the coup
- 2018-2022: President Bolsonaro repeatedly threatened democracy
- Historical memory remains contested[^13]
