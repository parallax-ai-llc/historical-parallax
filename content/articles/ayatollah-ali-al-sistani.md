## Summary

Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is one of the most influential Shia Muslim clerics in the world. Based in Najaf, Iraq, he is the most widely followed marja (source of emulation) among Shia Muslims globally. He has played a crucial political role in post-Saddam Iraq, advocating for democracy and restraining sectarian violence. His quietist approach to clerical authority contrasts with Iran's velayat-e faqih model.
