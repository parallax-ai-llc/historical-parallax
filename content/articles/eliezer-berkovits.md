## Summary

Eliezer Berkovits was a Romanian-born rabbi and philosopher who was one of the most important Jewish theologians of the post-Holocaust era. His book Faith after the Holocaust grappled with the theological challenges posed by the Shoah. He advocated for halakhic flexibility and the centrality of the Land of Israel in Jewish theology. His philosophical works challenged both Orthodox rigidity and liberal abandonment of tradition.
