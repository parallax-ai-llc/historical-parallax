## Summary

Harlow Shapley was an American astronomer who determined the size of the Milky Way and the Sun's position within it. Using Cepheid variable stars to measure distances to globular clusters, he showed that the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy but rather in its outskirts. He participated in the 'Great Debate' of 1920 with Heber Curtis about the nature of nebulae and the size of the universe.
