## Summary

Percivall Pott was a pioneering English surgeon who first described occupational cancer — linking chimney sweeps' scrotal cancer to soot exposure in 1775. He also described Pott's fracture of the ankle and Pott's disease (spinal tuberculosis). His work was among the first to establish environmental causes of cancer.
