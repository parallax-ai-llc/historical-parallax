## Overview

Captain James Cook (1728 – 1779) stands as one of the towering figures of the Age of Enlightenment. A farm laborer's son who rose through the ranks of the Royal Navy by sheer merit, Cook was a master cartographer, mathematician, and navigator. Over three epic voyages (1768–1779), he mapped more of the globe than any other explorer in history, dispelling myths of imaginary continents and filling the Pacific Ocean with accurate coordinates. He was the first European to make contact with the eastern coast of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. While his scientific achievements are undeniable, his legacy is increasingly examined through the lens of colonization and the devastating impact his arrival had on Indigenous peoples across the Pacific.

## The First Voyage (1768-1771): The Endeavour

**Mission:**
1.  **Public:** Transport scientists (Joseph Banks) to Tahiti to observe the Transit of Venus across the sun (crucial for calculating the distance between Earth and Sun).
2.  **Secret:** Open sealed orders only after the observation. Orders: Find *Terra Australis Incognita* (The Southern Continent).

**Tahiti:**
Cook's crew spent 3 months in Tahiti. It was a culture clash of sexual liberation (Tahitian women engaged freely with sailors) and theft (Tahitians stole metal nails, even pulling them out of the ship).
Cook enforced discipline with flogging, but struggled to control his men.

**New Zealand:**
Cook mapped the entire coastline (2,400 miles) in 6 months with near-perfect accuracy.
He proved New Zealand was two islands, separated by the strait that now bears his name (Cook Strait).
**Māori Contact:** The first encounter was violent. Cook's men shot a Māori leader. However, Cook later established wary trade relations, respecting their warrior culture.

**Australia (Botany Bay):**
April 1770: Sighted the east coast.
Landed at Botany Bay.
**The "Gweagal Shield" Incident:** Two warriors opposed the landing of 40 British men. They shouted "Warra Warra Wai" (Go away). Cook fired small shot, wounding one. This first act of violence set the tone for colonial history.
**The Great Barrier Reef:**
June 11, 1770: The *Endeavour* struck coral. Stuck fast 24 miles offshore.
The ship took on water. It was a moment of supreme crisis.
Cook ordered everything thrown overboard: 50 tons of cannons, ballast, and fresh water.
They "fothered" the hull (pulled a sail filled with oakum and sheep dung under the ship to plug the hole). It worked. They limped to shore (Cooktown) and spent 7 weeks repairing.

## The Second Voyage (1772-1775): The Ice

**Objective:** Disprove the existence of a habitable Southern Continent.
Ship: *HMS Resolution*.
**Achievement:** The first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle.
Cook circumnavigated Antarctica at high latitudes. He endured storms, fog, and icebergs for months.
**Jan 1774:** He reached 71°10'S. He was blocked by solid pack ice. He was just 75 miles from seeing the Antarctic mainland.
**Conclusion:** He wrote, *"If anyone should face the resolution... to push yet further South than I have done, I shall not envy him the fame."* He proved that *Terra Australis* was a myth, or if it existed, it was a frozen wasteland of no use to empires.

**Health Revolution:**
On this 3-year voyage, Cook lost **zero** men to scurvy.
His regime:
1.  **Sauerkraut:** Forced men to eat it (by serving it to officers first to make it look "privileged").
2.  **Cleanliness:** Forced baths and clean clothes.
3.  **Fresh Food:** Foraged greens at every land stop.

## The Third Voyage (1776-1779): The Death

**Objective:** Find the Northwest Passage from the Pacific side.
He mapped the coast of Oregon, British Columbia, and Alaska, through the Bering Strait. He hit the ice wall in the Arctic Ocean and had to turn back.

### The Hawaiian Tragedy
**Discovery (1778):** First European to visit Hawaii (named Sandwich Islands).
**Return (1779):** He returned to Kealakekua Bay ("Pathway of the God") on the Big Island.
**Coincidence:** He arrived during the festival of **Lono** (god of peace/agriculture). The ship's sails resembled Lono's emblems. The Hawaiians treated Cook with reverence, possibly as Lono's avatar.
Using up resources, relations frayed. Cook left, but a storm broke his mast, forcing him back.
The "God" returning out of season (during the season of Kū, god of war) confused and angered the priesthood.

**The Death of Cook (Feb 14, 1779):**
A cutter boat was stolen (for its iron nails).
Cook tried his standard tactic: Kidnap the King (Kalaniʻōpuʻu) until the boat is returned.
A massive crowd gathered. A priest chanted. A warrior threatened Cook.
Cook fired a shot (it bounced off a shield).
The mob rushed. Cook was stabbed in the neck and beaten to death in the surf. 4 Marines died with him.
**The Aftermath:**
The Hawaiians took his body and treated it with the highest funeral rites reserved for high chiefs (stripping the flesh, keeping the bones). When they returned a "piece of Cook" to the crew later (as a gesture of peace), the British were horrified, assuming cannibalism.

## Legacy

Cook is a dual figure.
To the **British Empire**, he was the heroic trailblazer who gave them Australia and New Zealand.
To **Indigenous Peoples**, he is the harbinger of dispossession, disease, and violence.
Regardless, as a navigator, he has no equal. He literally drew the map of the Pacific.
