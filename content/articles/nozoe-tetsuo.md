## Summary

Nozoe Tetsuo was a Japanese organic chemist who discovered tropolone and troponoid chemistry, an entirely new class of non-benzenoid aromatic compounds. His work on seven-membered aromatic ring systems expanded the theoretical understanding of aromaticity beyond benzene-based compounds and opened new areas of organic chemistry.
