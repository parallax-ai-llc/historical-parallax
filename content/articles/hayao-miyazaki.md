## Early Life and Background

Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Bunkyo, Tokyo, during World War II, the second of four sons in his family[^1]. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki, was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, a company that manufactured rudders for Zero fighter planes during the war, a fact that would later profoundly influence Miyazaki's pacifist views and complex relationship with aviation in his films[^2]. His mother, Yoshiko (née Takahashi), suffered from spinal tuberculosis and was bedridden for much of Miyazaki's childhood, spending years in the hospital between 1947 and 1955[^3]. This experience deeply affected the young Miyazaki and inspired the mother characters in several of his films, most notably in *My Neighbor Totoro*, where the mother's illness forms a central emotional thread[^4].

Growing up in post-war Japan, Miyazaki witnessed the country's dramatic transformation from wartime devastation to economic reconstruction[^5]. His family's relative wealth, derived from their wartime aircraft manufacturing business, created a sense of guilt that haunted Miyazaki throughout his life, as he was acutely aware that his comfortable childhood came at the expense of others' suffering during the war[^6]. This moral complexity would become a recurring theme in his work, particularly in films like *The Wind Rises*, which grapples with the ethical contradictions of creating beautiful machines designed for destruction[^7].

As a child, Miyazaki struggled academically and socially, finding solace in drawing and manga[^8]. He was particularly influenced by *Hakujaden* (The Tale of the White Serpent), the first color anime feature film released in Japan in 1958, which sparked his lifelong passion for animation[^9]. In 1959, Miyazaki enrolled at Gakushuin University, where he studied political science and economics rather than art, graduating in 1963[^10]. During his university years, he became increasingly interested in social and labor issues, developing leftist political views that would inform his later work[^11]. His early political consciousness was shaped by the Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and he became deeply critical of American imperialism and Japanese militarism[^12].

## Rise to Prominence

After graduating from university in 1963, Miyazaki joined Toei Animation as an in-between artist, working on films like *Watchdog Bow Wow* and *Wolf Boy Ken*[^13]. At Toei, he met fellow animator Isao Takahata, who would become his lifelong friend and creative partner, as well as animator Akemi Ota, whom he married in 1965[^14]. During his time at Toei, Miyazaki became actively involved in the labor union, serving as chief secretary of Toei's labor union and participating in strikes for better working conditions[^15]. This experience deepened his understanding of worker exploitation in the animation industry, a concern he would carry throughout his career[^16].

In 1971, Miyazaki moved to A-Pro with Takahata and Yoichi Kotabe, where they worked on *Lupin III* and developed their collaborative working style[^17]. He then joined Zuiyo Pictures in 1973, where he worked as an animator and scene designer on *Heidi, Girl of the Alps* under Takahata's direction[^18]. This series marked a turning point in Miyazaki's approach to animation, as Takahata insisted on extensive location scouting in Switzerland to ensure authentic backgrounds and atmosphere, a practice Miyazaki would adopt throughout his career[^19].

Miyazaki's directorial debut came with *The Castle of Cagliostro* in 1979, a *Lupin III* feature film that showcased his distinctive action sequences and romantic sensibility[^20]. Though not initially a commercial success, the film gained a cult following and demonstrated Miyazaki's potential as a director[^21]. In 1982, he began serializing his manga *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* in Animage magazine, which caught the attention of producer Toshio Suzuki and led to a film adaptation[^22].

The release of *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* in 1984 marked Miyazaki's breakthrough as a director[^23]. The film's ecological themes, strong female protagonist, and spectacular animation earned critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing 1.48 billion yen in Japan[^24]. The film's success enabled Miyazaki, Takahata, and Suzuki to establish Studio Ghibli in 1985, with funding from Tokuma Shoten publishing house[^25]. The name "Ghibli," derived from the Italian word for a hot desert wind, reflected Miyazaki's ambition to "blow a new wind through the anime industry"[^26].

## Major Achievements

Studio Ghibli's first official film, *Laputa: Castle in the Sky* (1986), established the studio's reputation for creating ambitious, beautifully animated fantasy adventures[^27]. However, it was *My Neighbor Totoro* (1988) that became Miyazaki's breakthrough with international audiences and one of the most beloved animated films of all time[^28]. The film's gentle story of two sisters befriending forest spirits in rural Japan captured universal themes of childhood wonder and created an iconic character in Totoro, who became Studio Ghibli's mascot[^29]. Initially released as a double feature with Takahata's *Grave of the Fireflies*, *Totoro* gained popularity gradually through home video releases and merchandising, eventually becoming a cultural phenomenon in Japan and abroad[^30].

*Kiki's Delivery Service* (1989) continued Ghibli's success, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan that year and further establishing Miyazaki's reputation for creating strong, independent female protagonists[^31]. The film's portrayal of a young witch finding her place in the world resonated with audiences and showcased Miyazaki's ability to tell coming-of-age stories with emotional depth and visual beauty[^32].

After a five-year hiatus during which he worked on other projects and contemplated retirement, Miyazaki returned with *Princess Mononoke* (1997), his most ambitious and mature film to date[^33]. The epic tale of conflict between industrial civilization and nature became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history at the time, earning 19.3 billion yen and surpassing *E.T.*[^34]. The film's complex moral landscape, where neither humans nor nature spirits are entirely good or evil, demonstrated Miyazaki's sophistication as a storyteller and his refusal to provide simple answers to environmental questions[^35]. Harvey Weinstein's Miramax acquired the film for North American distribution, bringing Miyazaki international recognition, though Miyazaki famously sent Weinstein a katana sword with the message "No cuts" to prevent editing[^36].

*Spirited Away* (2001) represented the apex of Miyazaki's commercial and critical success[^37]. The film tells the story of Chihiro, a ten-year-old girl who must work in a bathhouse for spirits to save her parents who have been transformed into pigs[^38]. Drawing on Japanese folklore and Miyazaki's concerns about modern consumerism and loss of traditional values, the film became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with 30.8 billion yen, a record it held for nearly two decades[^39]. Internationally, *Spirited Away* won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003, making Miyazaki the first (and as of 2025, only) Japanese director to win in that category[^40]. The film also won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, making it the only animated film to win the prestigious award[^41].

Following *Spirited Away*, Miyazaki created *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), based on Diana Wynne Jones's novel, which became another major commercial success and earned an Academy Award nomination[^42]. The film's anti-war themes were influenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the Iraq War, with the director stating that the film was "deeply affected by the war in Iraq"[^43]. *Ponyo* (2008), inspired by *The Little Mermaid*, represented Miyazaki's return to a younger target audience and showcased his mastery of hand-drawn animation, with the film containing 170,000 frames, many drawn by Miyazaki himself[^44].

In 2013, Miyazaki released *The Wind Rises*, a biographical film about Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Zero fighter plane[^45]. The film represented Miyazaki's most personal work, directly addressing his complex feelings about his father's wartime work and the contradictions of creating beauty in service of destruction[^46]. The film sparked controversy in Japan and neighboring countries for its portrayal of the war era, with some critics accusing Miyazaki of glorifying Japan's militarist past, though supporters argued the film was fundamentally anti-war[^47]. Following the film's release, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, stating he was "beyond the point where I can work like I used to"[^48].

However, Miyazaki came out of retirement to direct *How Do You Live?* (released internationally as *The Boy and the Heron*), which premiered in July 2023[^49]. The film, his most personal and surreal work, earned widespread critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2024, making Miyazaki, at 82, the oldest winner in the category[^50]. The film grossed over $294 million worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing Japanese films of all time[^51].

Beyond his directorial work, Miyazaki has profoundly influenced the animation industry through his mentorship and philosophy[^52]. He established the Studio Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo, which opened in 2001 and attracts over 650,000 visitors annually, showcasing the art and philosophy behind animation[^53]. His insistence on hand-drawn animation and meticulous attention to detail set standards that influenced animators worldwide[^54]. Miyazaki has received numerous honors, including the Order of Culture from the Japanese government in 2012, a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2005, and an Honorary Academy Award in 2014[^55].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his overwhelming critical and commercial success, Miyazaki has been the subject of various controversies and criticisms throughout his career. One of the most significant criticisms concerns his management style and treatment of Studio Ghibli employees. Multiple reports and insider accounts describe Miyazaki as an extremely demanding and perfectionist director who can be harsh and dismissive toward his staff[^56]. Former animators have described the intense pressure and long working hours at Studio Ghibli, with some suggesting that Miyazaki's exacting standards, while producing exceptional results, contributed to a difficult work environment[^57]. His son, Goro Miyazaki, who became a director himself, has spoken publicly about having a distant and complicated relationship with his father, whom he described as prioritizing work over family[^58].

Miyazaki's vocal opposition to digital animation and computer-generated imagery has drawn criticism from some in the animation industry who view his stance as stubbornly traditionalist[^59]. In 2016, he caused controversy when he harshly criticized an AI-generated animation demonstration, calling it "an insult to life itself" and refusing to work with the technology[^60]. While many praised his defense of human creativity, others felt his reaction was overly harsh and dismissive of potential technological innovation[^61]. His general skepticism toward computers and modern technology, while philosophically consistent with themes in his films, has been characterized by some critics as Luddite nostalgia[^62].

*The Wind Rises* sparked significant controversy, particularly in South Korea and China, where critics accused the film of whitewashing Japan's wartime aggression[^63]. The film's portrayal of Zero fighter designer Jiro Horikoshi as a tragic, romantic figure focused on his dreams of creating beautiful planes struck many as tone-deaf to the suffering these planes caused[^64]. South Korean media criticized the film for lacking reflection on Japan's colonial brutality, and some Chinese commentators argued that it represented Japanese historical revisionism[^65]. Miyazaki defended the film as fundamentally anti-war, pointing to its tragic ending and his own pacifist beliefs, but acknowledged the film dealt with "a very difficult subject"[^66].

Miyazaki's complicated relationship with feminism has also drawn criticism despite his reputation for creating strong female characters[^67]. Some feminist critics have noted that while his films feature capable, independent female protagonists, they often ultimately find fulfillment through romantic relationships with men or domestic/nurturing roles[^68]. In *Spirited Away*, despite Chihiro's heroic journey, some scholars argue the bathhouse setting reinforces traditional gendered labor, and her ultimate goal is saving her family rather than purely self-actualization[^69]. Additionally, Miyazaki's admitted attraction to drawing young girls has made some uncomfortable, though he has framed this as an attempt to capture innocence and strength rather than anything sexual[^70].

His political statements have occasionally sparked backlash in Japan. In 2013, Miyazaki published an essay opposing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's attempts to revise Japan's pacifist constitution, stating Japan should apologize for its wartime actions and never engage in war again[^71]. While praised by progressives, this stance drew criticism from Japanese conservatives and nationalists who accused him of being unpatriotic[^72]. His criticism of the Japanese government's handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster and his opposition to nuclear power also generated controversy among pro-nuclear advocates[^73].

Some critics have also pointed to a certain repetitiveness in Miyazaki's themes and visual motifs, suggesting that his later works particularly rely heavily on familiar elements from his earlier films[^74]. The recurring presence of flight, strong young female protagonists, environmental themes, and similar visual designs (particularly in character faces and body types) has led some reviewers to argue that Miyazaki has become somewhat self-derivative, particularly in his later career[^75].

Finally, Miyazaki's multiple "retirements" and subsequent returns have been the subject of industry jokes and mild criticism, with some suggesting these announcements are strategic publicity moves rather than genuine intentions[^76]. After announcing retirement following *Princess Mononoke* (1997), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), *Ponyo* (2008), and *The Wind Rises* (2013), only to return each time, some have questioned the sincerity of these declarations[^77].

## Personal Life

Hayao Miyazaki married fellow animator Akemi Ota in October 1965, after working together at Toei Animation[^78]. Akemi, who animated on projects including *The Flying Ghost Ship* and *Panda! Go Panda!*, largely withdrew from animation work after their marriage to focus on raising their family, a decision that reflects the traditional gender dynamics of 1960s Japan that Miyazaki later complicated in his films[^79]. The couple has two sons: Goro Miyazaki, born in 1967, who became a landscape architect before eventually directing several Studio Ghibli films, and Keisuke Miyazaki, born in 1969, who works as a wood artist and ran a woodworking shop[^80].

Miyazaki's relationship with his eldest son Goro has been notably strained and publicly documented. When Goro was asked to direct *Tales from Earthsea* (2006) despite having no animation experience, Hayao publicly expressed disapproval, and the two reportedly did not speak during much of the production[^81]. Goro has spoken in interviews about feeling his father was absent during his childhood, consumed by work, and that even as an adult seeking his father's approval through filmmaking, he found Hayao difficult to please[^82]. In the documentary *Kingdom of Dreams and Madness* (2013), the distance between father and son is palpable, with Hayao making critical comments about Goro's work while expressing regret about their relationship[^83]. However, in recent years, they appear to have reconciled somewhat, with Goro expressing understanding of his father's dedication to his art[^84].

Miyazaki is known for his intense work ethic, often working seven days a week and immersing himself completely in his projects[^85]. He maintains a relatively modest lifestyle despite his immense success and wealth, living in the same house in Tokyo for decades[^86]. He is an avid reader, particularly of children's literature, and has cited authors like Ursula K. Le Guin, Diana Wynne Jones, and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry as influences[^87]. His love of aviation extends beyond his films; he is knowledgeable about aircraft engineering and history, and his private collection of aviation books and models is extensive[^88].

Despite creating fantastical worlds filled with magic and wonder, Miyazaki himself has stated he does not believe in the supernatural or religion, viewing his fantastical elements as metaphorical expressions of emotional and philosophical ideas rather than literal beliefs[^89]. He is a chain-smoker, a habit frequently visible in documentary footage of him working, though he has expressed guilt about the habit and concern about its health effects[^90]. He begins each day by cleaning Studio Ghibli's grounds and surrounding neighborhood, a ritual he describes as meditative and necessary for mental clarity[^91].

Miyazaki's personality is often described as contradictory: gentle and patient with children, but demanding and sometimes harsh with adults; deeply empathetic in his films, yet difficult in personal relationships; creatively inspired by pre-industrial pastoral life, yet rigorously analytical and organized in his working methods[^92]. Colleagues describe him as someone with an almost supernatural ability to visualize complex scenes and movements in his mind, sketching detailed storyboards at remarkable speed[^93]. He is also known for his dry, sometimes dark sense of humor and his willingness to make self-deprecating comments about his own work and legacy[^94].

## Legacy

Hayao Miyazaki's impact on animation and cinema extends far beyond his filmography, fundamentally reshaping how animated films are perceived and valued globally. Before Studio Ghibli's international success, animation was largely relegated to children's entertainment in the Western consciousness, but Miyazaki's films demonstrated that animation could be a medium for sophisticated storytelling that appeals to all ages[^95]. His work has been cited as influential by numerous Western directors including John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Travis Knight, and Guillermo del Toro, with Pixar's chief creative officer Pete Docter stating that *My Neighbor Totoro* "proved that you don't need conflict to tell a story"[^96].

Miyazaki's portrayal of strong, complex female protagonists has had a lasting cultural impact, particularly in an industry historically dominated by male heroes[^97]. Characters like San from *Princess Mononoke*, Chihiro from *Spirited Away*, and Nausicaä are celebrated for their agency, moral complexity, and refusal to be defined by romantic relationships alone, even as they experience connection and love[^98]. Scholar Susan Napier notes that Miyazaki's female characters "combine strength with vulnerability, determination with doubt, in ways that feel genuinely revolutionary for animation"[^99]. His influence on female character design and storytelling can be seen in animated films worldwide, from Pixar's *Brave* to Disney's *Moana*[^100].

The environmental themes in Miyazaki's work have contributed to broader cultural conversations about humanity's relationship with nature. Films like *Nausicaä*, *Princess Mononoke*, and *Ponyo* present ecological crises not as simple morality tales but as complex situations where human needs and environmental preservation exist in tension[^101]. Environmental scholars have examined Miyazaki's films as examples of Japanese animism and Shinto-influenced environmental philosophy, where nature is imbued with spirit and agency rather than being mere backdrop[^102]. His work has been used in educational contexts to teach environmental ethics and inspire environmental activism[^103].

Studio Ghibli's influence on the economics of animation cannot be overstated. The studio's success proved that hand-drawn, artistically ambitious animation could be commercially viable in the age of computer animation, inspiring studios worldwide to invest in quality over cost-cutting[^104]. The "Ghibli effect" in Japan refers to the phenomenon where television ratings plummet when Studio Ghibli films air on broadcast television, demonstrating their enduring cultural dominance[^105]. The studio's meticulous attention to detail, insistence on complete storyboarding before animation begins, and rejection of shortcuts became influential industry practices[^106].

Miyazaki's aesthetic influence is immediately recognizable: the emphasis on detailed, realistic backgrounds contrasted with more stylized characters; the use of silence and contemplative pacing; the "ma" (間) or negative space in storytelling that allows viewers room to breathe and reflect[^107]. These aesthetic choices have influenced not just animation but live-action filmmaking, with directors like Wes Anderson acknowledging Miyazaki's impact on visual composition and pacing[^108].

The Studio Ghibli Museum in Mitaka has become a pilgrimage site for animation fans worldwide, attracting international visitors who view Miyazaki's work as culturally significant art[^109]. The museum's philosophy, designed by Miyazaki himself, emphasizes the joy of discovery and hands-on understanding of animation principles, influencing how animation is taught and appreciated[^110]. Retrospectives of Miyazaki's work at major museums, including the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and Tokyo's Mori Arts Center, have treated his films as fine art worthy of scholarly analysis and preservation[^111].

Miyazaki's impact on Japanese soft power and cultural diplomacy has been substantial. Studio Ghibli films have introduced Japanese aesthetics, philosophy, and mythology to global audiences, serving as cultural ambassadors that present Japanese culture with nuance and depth[^112]. The Japanese government has recognized this contribution, awarding Miyazaki the Order of Culture and featuring Studio Ghibli imagery in cultural promotion campaigns[^113].

Perhaps most significantly, Miyazaki demonstrated that uncompromising artistic vision and commercial success are not mutually exclusive. By refusing to pander to focus groups, resisting pressure to create franchises and sequels (with rare exceptions), and insisting on creative control, Miyazaki proved that audiences worldwide would embrace challenging, thoughtful, emotionally complex animated films[^114]. This legacy has empowered independent animators and directors to pursue personal visions rather than commercial formulas[^115].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Film scholars and critics overwhelmingly regard Miyazaki as one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern era, with many placing him alongside live-action masters like Kurosawa, Bergman, and Fellini[^116]. Roger Ebert wrote that Miyazaki's films "are as significant as the great works of literature" and praised his ability to create "alternative worlds" that feel more authentic than reality[^117]. The late critic Roger Ebert placed *Spirited Away* among his "Great Movies," writing that it "is one of the best films ever made for children — or anyone"[^118].

Animation historians credit Miyazaki with elevating the medium's artistic credibility globally. Scholar Helen McCarthy, author of *The Art of Studio Ghibli*, argues that Miyazaki "single-handedly changed Western perceptions of what animation could be," transforming it from a marginalized children's medium to recognized cinema[^119]. John Lasseter, former Pixar chief creative officer, has repeatedly praised Miyazaki as his primary influence, stating, "If you ask any animator today who their heroes are, chances are Hayao Miyazaki will be at the top of the list"[^120].

Environmental philosophers and scholars have praised Miyazaki's nuanced approach to ecological themes. Environmental humanities scholar Jennifer E. Brayton argues that Miyazaki's films present "an ecological ethic that refuses simplistic dualisms," offering sophisticated meditations on human-nature relationships[^121]. Physicist and environmentalist Amory Lovins has cited *Princess Mononoke* as demonstrating complex environmental thinking that acknowledges "real conflicts between immediate human needs and long-term ecological sustainability"[^122].

Asian American cultural critics have celebrated Miyazaki for presenting Asian characters and settings without exoticization or Orientalism, creating universally relatable stories while maintaining cultural specificity[^123]. Author and cultural critic Jeff Yang notes that Miyazaki's films "allowed Asian diaspora children to see themselves as protagonists in magical stories," counteracting the whitewashing prevalent in Western animation[^124].

Feminist scholars, despite some criticisms, generally praise Miyazaki's female characters as revolutionary for animation. Rebecca Housel, editor of *Miyazaki's Mythic Imagination*, argues that his heroines "embody a feminism that is active rather than reactive, defined by what they accomplish rather than what they resist"[^125]. The lack of traditional Disney-style romance plots as primary drivers, even in films featuring romantic elements, is seen as particularly progressive[^126].

Child development experts have praised Miyazaki's films for their emotional intelligence and their trust in young viewers' ability to handle complex themes. Pediatric psychologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen notes that Miyazaki's films "respect children's capacity for nuanced emotional understanding" while not traumatizing them with excessive violence or frightening content[^127]. Educational psychologists have examined how his films can facilitate discussions of loss, change, and moral complexity with children[^128].

## Negative Views

Some critics argue that Miyazaki's work, despite its beauty, can be overly sentimental and nostalgic, romanticizing pre-industrial rural life while ignoring its harsh realities[^129]. Cultural critic Azuma Hiroki has suggested that Miyazaki's pastoral fantasies represent a form of escapism that allows Japanese audiences to avoid confronting modern social problems, creating "a beautiful lie about a past that never existed"[^130]. This critique points to the absence of the poverty, disease, and social stratification that characterized pre-modern Japanese rural life in films like *My Neighbor Totoro*[^131].

Political conservatives, particularly in Japan, have criticized Miyazaki's outspoken left-wing political views and his criticisms of Japanese nationalism[^132]. His statements against constitutional revision and his calls for Japan to acknowledge wartime atrocities have made him a target for right-wing commentators who accuse him of "self-hating" attitudes toward Japanese history[^133]. Some conservative critics argue that his films, particularly *The Wind Rises*, contain contradictory messages that undermine his stated pacifist intentions[^134].

Animation industry professionals have sometimes criticized what they perceive as Miyazaki's hypocrisy regarding working conditions. While he has spoken about the exploitation of animators, Studio Ghibli itself has been accused of demanding extremely long hours and intense pressure from its staff[^135]. When Studio Ghibli temporarily disbanded its production department in 2014, critics pointed out that even a successful studio founded on idealistic principles struggled to create sustainable working conditions for animators[^136].

Some Western animation critics have argued that Miyazaki's films, while beautiful, can be narratively loose and meandering by Western storytelling standards[^137]. Critics accustomed to three-act structure and clear protagonist goals sometimes find films like *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Ponyo* lacking in conventional dramatic tension[^138]. Animation critic Charles Solomon wrote that while Miyazaki's visual imagination is unmatched, "his plots can feel episodic and his endings sometimes feel arbitrary rather than earned"[^139].

Postcolonial critics, particularly from South Korea and China, have argued that Miyazaki's work, despite his personal progressive politics, sometimes perpetuates Japanese cultural imperialism by presenting Japanese aesthetics and mythology as universally representative of "Asia"[^140]. The international success of Studio Ghibli films, some argue, has overshadowed and marginalized animation from other Asian countries, creating a situation where "Japanese animation becomes synonymous with Asian animation in Western consciousness"[^141].

Gender studies scholars have noted that despite Miyazaki's strong female characters, his films rarely feature adult women in positions of institutional power, and powerful female characters are often supernatural beings or young girls rather than mature women navigating social structures[^142]. Critic Frenchy Lunning points out that Miyazaki's female characters, while active and brave, "often operate in domestic or service roles—bathhouse workers, cleaners, cooks—even as they have adventures"[^143].

Some disability advocates have criticized the portrayal of disability in Miyazaki's films, particularly the implication in *Howl's Moving Castle* that physical beauty correlates with moral goodness, and the magical "curing" of disabilities in films like *Princess Mononoke*[^144]. These narrative choices, critics argue, reinforce ableist assumptions about the necessity of physical ability for heroism and fulfillment[^145].

Finally, some critics within Japan have argued that the international art-house success of Miyazaki's films has created unrealistic expectations and pressure on the Japanese animation industry, creating a perception that all anime should aspire to Ghibli's model when in fact Japanese animation's diversity and range, including more commercial and genre-specific works, deserves recognition[^146].
