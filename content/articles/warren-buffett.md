## Summary

Warren Edward Buffett (born 1930), known as the "Oracle of Omaha," is an American investor, business magnate, and philanthropist who is considered one of the most successful investors of all time. As chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett built a conglomerate worth over $800 billion through value investing—buying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals and holding them long-term. His folksy wisdom, frugal lifestyle (still lives in house bought in 1958), annual shareholder letters, and commitment to giving away 99% of his fortune have made him perhaps the most admired businessperson in America.
