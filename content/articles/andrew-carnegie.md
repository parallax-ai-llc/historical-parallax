## Summary

Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) was a Scottish-American industrialist who led the enormous expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century, becoming one of the wealthiest individuals in history.[^1] Born in poverty in Dunfermline, Scotland, he immigrated to America at age 12 and rose from bobbin boy to steel magnate through innovation, ruthless business tactics, and vertical integration.[^2] After selling Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan for $480 million in 1901, he devoted the remainder of his life to philanthropy, donating over $350 million to libraries, universities, and peace initiatives.[^3] His legacy remains controversial, celebrated both as the "father of modern philanthropy" and condemned as a "robber baron" who exploited workers.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Andrew Carnegie was born on November 25, 1835, in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room.[^5] His father, William Carnegie, was a hand loom weaver, a profession the young Andrew was expected to follow.[^6] His mother, Margaret Morrison Carnegie, came from a family with a strong tradition of self-education, political activism, and liberalism.[^7] Carnegie's uncle George taught the young boy about Scottish history and introduced him to the writings of Robert Burns, having him commit many of Burns's best works to memory.[^8]

The town's once-booming linen industry fell on hard times by the 1840s as the industrial revolution destroyed the weavers' craft.[^9] When steam-powered looms came to Dunfermline in 1847, hundreds of hand loom weavers, including Carnegie's father, became expendable.[^10] Andrew's mother went to work to support the family, opening a small grocery shop and mending shoes.[^11] Carnegie's family was politically active—his father Will and uncle Tom Morrison led the Chartist movement in Dunfermline, which advocated for political reforms to improve conditions for working people.[^12]

Due to economic depression in Scotland, the Carnegie family immigrated to the United States in 1848 when Andrew was 12 years old.[^13] They joined a Scottish colony of relatives and friends in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, just outside Pittsburgh.[^14] William Carnegie secured work in a cotton factory, and Andrew took work in the same building as a bobbin boy for $1.20 a week, laboring 12-hour days.[^15] From these humble beginnings in a dark cellar, covered in coal dust, young Carnegie found solace in education and reading.[^16]

Carnegie's passion for reading received a crucial boost from Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night.[^17] Carnegie was a consistent borrower, and this access to books made "the future always bright" for the young immigrant worker.[^18] He became deeply familiar with Macaulay's essays and history, which taught him clear, powerful prose.[^19] Carnegie also discovered the magic of Shakespeare through theater, watching the celebrated tragedian Edwin Adams perform Macbeth at the old Pittsburgh Theater.[^20] Carnegie was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he "resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [to see to it] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the nobleman."[^21]

## Rise to Power

Carnegie's rise from poverty to immense wealth exemplifies the American dream narrative of the Gilded Age. In 1849, he secured work as a messenger boy in a telegraph office, earning $2.50 per week—double his previous wage.[^22] Through diligence and self-education, he became proficient in telegraphy and in 1853 became the personal telegrapher and assistant to Thomas Scott, superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad's western division, earning $35 per month.[^23]

When his father died in 1855, the young Carnegie became the family's sole breadwinner.[^24] His responsibilities and ambitions grew together. In 1856, he was appointed superintendent of the Western Division of Pennsylvania Railroad Company on a salary of $1,500 per year.[^25] During his time with the railroad, Carnegie demonstrated both his business acumen and his willingness to use forceful methods—in 1856, he put down a strike by railroad workers.[^26]

Carnegie's wealth accumulation accelerated through strategic investments. He invested early in railroad companies, oil, and eventually steel.[^27] In 1861, Carnegie organized the Freedom Iron Company to make iron rails.[^28] In 1870, he co-founded the Keystone Bridge Company.[^29] Carnegie saw great promise in new steel technology after a visit to Henry Bessemer in 1872, viewing it as a useful adjunct to his existing businesses.[^30] He hired Andrew Holley, the Bessemer process's first major U.S. proponent, to design his first plant.[^31]

The Edgar Thomson Steel Works opened in 1875, marking Carnegie's full entry into steel production.[^32] During the depression of 1873, Carnegie invested heavily in steel, raising the quality while reducing prices by using the Bessemer process.[^33] This process, patented by an English engineer in 1856, provided an inexpensive method for mass-producing steel by blowing air through molten iron to remove impurities.[^34] Using the Bessemer process, Carnegie Steel reduced the costs of steel railroad rails from $100 per ton to $50 per ton between 1873 and 1875.[^35] By the 1890s, Carnegie was selling rails for $18 per ton.[^36]

Carnegie's strategy for dominating the steel industry involved vertical integration—controlling every aspect of steel production from raw materials to distribution.[^37] He bought mining land in Minnesota's rich Mesabi Iron Range, along with a small fleet of vessels to transport ore to Pittsburgh.[^38] He acquired vast coalfields and beehive ovens that made coke when he brought Henry Clay Frick into Carnegie Steel.[^39] By 1900, his company controlled every aspect of steelmaking, from the time the ore left the ground to its appearance as a finished steel rail.[^40]

In 1883, Carnegie bought the Homestead Works, a rival mill.[^41] By 1889, Carnegie's vast holdings were consolidated into the Carnegie Steel Company, a limited partnership that henceforth dominated the American steel industry.[^42] Carnegie became the largest steel producer in the world, and by the turn of the 20th century, he was producing more steel than the entire British steel industry.[^43]

## Major Achievements

Andrew Carnegie's achievements transformed American industry and established new models for both business organization and philanthropic giving. His greatest business accomplishment was building Carnegie Steel into the world's largest and most efficient steel company through technological innovation and organizational excellence.

Carnegie revolutionized steel production by aggressively adopting and improving new technologies. At his Edgar Thomson Works, he effectively introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process to the United States, enabling mass production of steel and leading to steel replacing iron as the metal of choice in many products.[^44] Unlike competitors who were satisfied with established methods, Carnegie understood he could not rely on being the premier capitalist alone.[^45] He embraced technology as the key driver of operational and financial success, continually reinvesting profits into the mills and frequently ordering even modestly outdated equipment torn out and replaced.[^46]

When a newer and more efficient process known as open hearth was developed, Carnegie simply scrapped existing equipment and made the transition to the new system.[^47] The Open Hearth Process had the potential to triple the capacity of an average mill, and Carnegie installed the first Open Hearth furnace at the Homestead Mill.[^48] This relentless pursuit of efficiency allowed Carnegie Steel to dramatically reduce production costs and undercut competitors.

Carnegie employed a business strategy he called "hard driving"—working men and machines to their absolute limits.[^49] He relied on a merit-based promotion system that incentivized productivity and loyalty among employees, with managers often promoted from within, fostering deep understanding of company operations.[^50] This system created intense competition among his managers and drove continuous improvement.

His vertical integration strategy became a model studied by business schools for generations. By controlling railroads, iron mines, coal fields, coke ovens, barges, steel mills, and distribution networks, Carnegie achieved unprecedented cost advantages.[^51] This comprehensive control of the supply chain meant he could reduce costs and produce steel cheaper than any competitor, creating a near-monopoly in large industrial markets.[^52]

In 1901, Carnegie sold Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan's newly formed United States Steel Corporation for $480 million, with Carnegie's personal share being $225.6 million.[^53] This sale created the world's first billion-dollar corporation, capitalized at $1.4 billion.[^54] Carnegie, at age 65, became one of the richest persons in the United States—and indeed, in world history.[^55]

Carnegie's philanthropic achievements rival his business accomplishments. He articulated his philosophy in the 1889 essay "The Gospel of Wealth," originally titled simply "Wealth" and published in the North American Review.[^56] This essay is considered a foundational document in the field of philanthropy.[^57] Carnegie believed in giving wealth away during one's lifetime, famously writing, "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."[^58] He proposed that the best way of dealing with wealth inequality was for the wealthy to utilize their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner, empowering the poor to uplift themselves through education and opportunity.[^59]

Carnegie established 2,509 libraries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with 1,679 built in the United States.[^60] He spent more than $56 million to build public libraries across the United States, Canada, and other nations.[^61] Carnegie put his philosophy into practice with the idea that he was providing people with the tools to better themselves through access to knowledge.[^62]

Beyond libraries, Carnegie made transformative gifts to education. In 1900, he created a $2 million endowment for technical schools in Pittsburgh that quickly evolved into the Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving an additional endowment of more than $7 million.[^63] In 1967, this institute merged with the Mellon Institute to become Carnegie Mellon University.[^64] Carnegie's "Music Hall" opened on May 5, 1891, at the corner of 57th Street and Seventh Avenue in New York.[^65] It became known simply as Carnegie Hall and has become one of the most famous concert halls in the world.[^66]

Carnegie's largest gifts included $125 million to the Carnegie Corporation of New York, $29 million to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22 million to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, and $10 million to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.[^67] Through Carnegie Corporation of New York, the innovative philanthropic foundation he established in 1911, his fortune has supported everything from the discovery of insulin and the dismantling of nuclear weapons to the creation of Pell Grants and Sesame Street.[^68]

Before his death on August 11, 1919, Carnegie had donated $350,695,654 for various causes—approximately 90% of his personal fortune.[^69] His total benefactions amounted to $350 million, with $288 million going to the United States and $62 million to the British Empire.[^70]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his philanthropic legacy, Andrew Carnegie faced severe criticism for his treatment of workers and his business practices. The most damaging event to his reputation was the Homestead Strike of 1892, which revealed the contradictions between Carnegie's public statements supporting labor and his actual treatment of workers.

Carnegie was publicly in favor of labor unions and condemned the use of strikebreakers, telling associates that no steel mill was worth a single drop of blood.[^71] He claimed in his autobiography that he never employed strikebreakers, yet he did so repeatedly.[^72] In 1886, Carnegie published an essay defending workers' rights to organize.[^73] However, Carnegie biographer David Nasaw observed: "Carnegie's commitment to giving away his fortune did not make him a more philanthropic employer. On the contrary, he became, if anything, more ruthless in pursuit of profits once he had determined that those profits would be distributed during his lifetime."[^74]

The Homestead Strike began on July 1, 1892, at the Homestead Steel Works in the Pittsburgh-area town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and Carnegie Steel Company.[^75] Carnegie gave his operations manager, Henry Clay Frick, permission to break the union before the contract deadline.[^76] Frick began by cutting workers' wages, which the workers protested by starting the strike.[^77] Frick responded by building a fence three miles long and 12 feet high around the steelworks plant, adding peepholes for rifles and topping it with barbed wire.[^78]

The striking workers were all fired on July 2, and on July 6, private security guards from the Pinkerton agency hired by the company arrived by barge.[^79] The guards and workers exchanged gunfire in a battle that resulted in at least three guards and seven workers killed, with many more wounded.[^80] The Pinkertons fired on unarmed workers, and many were shot in the back as they ran for their lives.[^81] The final result was a major defeat for the union strikers and a setback for efforts to unionize steelworkers.[^82] For 26 long years—until the last months of World War I in 1918—union organizing among steelworkers was crushed.[^83]

Carnegie was in Scotland at Skibo Castle during the strike, but he was in constant contact with Frick throughout.[^84] With his pro-worker reputation tattered by the blood spilled at Homestead, Carnegie tried to distance himself from Frick's decision-making, though evidence shows he approved the strategy.[^85] Carnegie was described as the most contradictory of the robber barons: he supported workers' rights but destroyed unions.[^86]

Carnegie and other so-called "robber barons" were accused of exploiting workers by offering low wages and requiring long shifts in unsafe working conditions.[^87] Carnegie was known for lowering production costs by exploiting labor, paying low wages, and promoting harsh working conditions, especially in his steel mills.[^88] His wealth continued to grow as he minimized costs, including workers' wages.[^89] Though Carnegie purported to be a champion of his workers, his alleged exploitation of them through cutting pay led to him being labeled a robber baron.[^90]

The "robber baron" label was applied to industrialists like Carnegie to criticize their perceived ruthlessness.[^91] They were challenged for their monopolistic practices, seeming disregard for the rights and wellbeing of their laborers, and their accumulation of enormous personal fortunes at huge social costs.[^92] While it is somewhat unfair to say Carnegie enjoyed a monopoly on steel production, he did drive out competitors in large industrial markets and focused on achieving economies of scale that made competition nearly impossible.[^93]

## Personal Life

Andrew Carnegie met Louise Whitfield when he was 45 years old and she was 23.[^94] They married on April 22, 1887, at her family's home in New York City in a private ceremony when Louise was 30 and Carnegie was 51.[^95] Carnegie only married Louise after his mother Margaret's death in November 1886.[^96] His mother had been possessive of him and had interfered with their relationship earlier, preventing Louise from joining them on a trip to Scotland in 1881.[^97]

Louise Whitfield Carnegie (1857-1946) was an American philanthropist who became an important partner in Carnegie's charitable work.[^98] Louise signed a prenuptial agreement, renouncing any claims to Andrew's fortune.[^99] In return, Andrew gave her stocks and bonds that amounted to an independent annual income of $20,000.[^100] Despite the prenuptial agreement, Louise advised Andrew Carnegie as they jointly helped create over 2,500 libraries between 1883 and 1929.[^101]

Ten years after their marriage, in 1897, Louise gave birth to the couple's only child, Margaret Carnegie.[^102] Margaret married Roswell Miller Jr. on April 22, 1919—the couple's 32nd wedding anniversary.[^103] Margaret's marriage produced four children: Louise (born June 17, 1920), Roswell III (December 14, 1922), Barbara (April 3, 1925), and Margaret Morrison "Margot" Miller (July 15, 1926).[^104]

Carnegie never forgot his Scottish roots, though he wouldn't return to his hometown of Dunfermline for 14 years after emigrating.[^105] After achieving success, he became a frequent visitor to Scotland, particularly following his retirement from business.[^106] In 1898, the Carnegie family acquired Skibo Castle near Dornoch in the Scottish Highlands.[^107] Carnegie called it his "heaven on earth," and perhaps the happiest and most satisfying period of his life was spent there.[^108] From then on, the family split their time between their New York mansion and Skibo Castle, usually arriving in the Highlands at the end of May and departing at the end of September.[^109] Every day at Skibo was started by a resident bagpiper.[^110]

Carnegie demonstrated his affection for Dunfermline through extraordinary generosity. In 1874, Dunfermline received Carnegie's first public gift.[^111] In 1883, it became home to one of Carnegie's first storied public library buildings.[^112] Carnegie created the Dunfermline Trust in 1903 with a specifically local focus.[^113] In 1902, he purchased the 76-acre Pittencrieff Park and gifted it to Dunfermline in 1903.[^114] A painting was commissioned by Carnegie to commemorate a parade that was part of his homecoming visit to Dunfermline in 1881, when he took American friends and his mother, Margaret, who was celebrating her 71st birthday.[^115]

Carnegie's personality reflected his belief in self-improvement and hard work. He was known for sayings that emphasized action over words, concentration, and teamwork.[^116] Despite his immense wealth, he maintained connections to his working-class origins through his philanthropy and his lifelong commitment to providing opportunities for others to better themselves.[^117]

## Legacy

Andrew Carnegie's legacy encompasses both transformative contributions to American industry and philanthropy, as well as enduring controversies about wealth inequality and labor relations. He is often referred to as the "father of modern philanthropy" and is considered the most influential philanthropist in American history, with his donations, when adjusted for inflation, exceeding those of virtually everyone else in the nation's history.[^118]

Carnegie's essay "The Gospel of Wealth" became a foundational document that shaped American philanthropy for generations.[^119] By linking giving not just to traditional religious values but also to preservation of the American economic and political system, Carnegie extended the rationale for philanthropy, imbuing charitable giving with extra appeal for generations of entrepreneurs and self-made men and women who came after him.[^120] His foundation helped launch the era of modern philanthropy and embraced a technical approach to giving that applied strict management principles and often the best of science, technology, and engineering.[^121]

Carnegie's commitment to transparency in philanthropy has had lasting impact. He passed the habit of transparency on to the organizations he established, which longtime Corporation trustee Russell C. Leffingwell famously termed "glass pockets," a phrase that has caught on throughout philanthropy.[^122] The level of philanthropy displayed by Carnegie during his lifetime and beyond has been the foundation for traditions of philanthropy today, with his endeavors beginning the first efforts toward the modern-day foundation or trust.[^123]

The 2,509 Carnegie libraries he founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries remain visible monuments to his belief in self-improvement through education.[^124] Many of these libraries continue to serve communities more than a century after their construction. Carnegie put his philosophy into practice with the idea that he was providing people with the tools to better themselves—a library, he believed, "outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people. It is a never failing spring in the desert."[^125]

Carnegie's business innovations left an equally profound legacy. His vertical integration strategy became a model studied in business schools worldwide.[^126] His aggressive adoption of new technologies like the Bessemer and open hearth processes demonstrated the competitive advantages of continuous innovation.[^127] His management practices, including merit-based promotion and "hard driving" operations, influenced industrial management for decades.[^128]

In peace activism, although Carnegie's promotion of anti-imperialism and world peace did not prevent World War I, his beliefs and ideas on international relations helped build the foundation for the League of Nations after his death.[^129] The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, established in 1910 with $10 million, continues its work today.[^130] Carnegie was a major supporter of the Anti-Imperialist League during the Spanish-American War of 1898 and even offered to buy the Philippines from the United States so that the natives could have their independence.[^131]

However, Carnegie's legacy remains controversial. The Homestead Strike of 1892 permanently tarnished his reputation as a friend of labor and raised questions about whether philanthropic giving can compensate for wealth accumulated through exploitation.[^132] Modern assessments acknowledge that Carnegie's business success came at significant human cost—low wages, dangerous working conditions, violent strike suppression, and the destruction of labor unions in the steel industry for a generation.[^133]

The debate regarding Carnegie's status as a "robber baron" or "captain of industry" continues among scholars and historians. Harold Livesay argues that business moguls of the late 1800s were creative and ambitious but sometimes used ruthless and exploitative practices to achieve their success.[^134] Matthew Josephson contends that powerful tycoons of the Gilded Age may have accomplished a great deal, but they did it chiefly for personal financial gain.[^135] Allan Nevins argues that the "robber baron" title is an unfair label to place on innovative business leaders responsible for the financial growth of the American economy.[^136]

Carnegie's legacy represents both the transformative potential of strategic, large-scale philanthropy and ongoing debates about the relationship between wealth accumulation and social responsibility.[^137] His life raises enduring questions about capitalism, inequality, and the obligations of the wealthy that remain relevant in contemporary discussions about billionaire philanthropists.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters of Andrew Carnegie argue that he should be viewed as a captain of industry who played a pivotal role in the economic development of the United States.[^138] They emphasize Carnegie's transformative impact on the steel industry, which helped propel America into an era of unprecedented growth and prosperity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[^139] Carnegie's innovations in steel production, particularly his adoption of the Bessemer process and vertical integration, made steel affordable and abundant, enabling the construction of railroads, bridges, skyscrapers, and the infrastructure of modern America.[^140]

Historian Allan Nevins argues that the "robber baron" title is an unfair label to place on innovative business leaders like Carnegie who were responsible for the financial growth of the American economy.[^141] Nevins and other defenders point out that Carnegie's business practices, while aggressive, were legal within the context of Gilded Age capitalism and that his contributions to industrial development benefited the nation as a whole.[^142]

Carnegie's philanthropic legacy garners particularly strong praise from scholars. His strategic approach to giving, articulated in "The Gospel of Wealth," established principles that continue to guide major philanthropists today.[^143] Carnegie Corporation of New York and his other foundations have supported transformative initiatives in education, science, international peace, and social progress.[^144] Supporters argue that his donations—over $350 million, or 90% of his wealth—demonstrate a genuine commitment to social responsibility that distinguishes him from other industrialists of his era.[^145]

Carnegie's commitment to libraries specifically receives widespread admiration. By founding over 2,500 libraries, he democratized access to knowledge and provided tools for self-improvement to millions of people.[^146] His belief that the wealthy had an obligation to act as stewards for those less fortunate, articulated through his concept of "noblesse oblige," established an ethic of philanthropic responsibility among American elites.[^147]

Defenders also note Carnegie's progressive stances on some issues. He was a vocal anti-imperialist who opposed Philippine annexation and became vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.[^148] He invested heavily in peace initiatives, establishing the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with the charge to "hasten the abolition of international war, the foulest blot upon our civilization."[^149] His public support for workers' rights to organize, even if contradicted by his actions, showed awareness of labor concerns unusual among industrialists of his time.[^150]

Carnegie's life story as an immigrant who rose from poverty to become one of the world's richest men through hard work, innovation, and strategic thinking embodies the American dream narrative.[^151] His emphasis on education, self-improvement, and opportunity resonates with American values of individual achievement and upward mobility.[^152]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Carnegie should be classified as a "robber baron" whose wealth was built on exploitation of workers and ruthless suppression of labor rights.[^153] Historian Matthew Josephson contends that powerful tycoons of the Gilded Age like Carnegie may have accomplished a great deal, but they did it chiefly for personal financial gain, not public benefit.[^154] Harold Livesay argues that while business moguls of the late 1800s were creative and ambitious, they often used ruthless and exploitative practices to achieve their success.[^155]

The Homestead Strike of 1892 stands as the most damaging evidence against Carnegie's reputation. Critics point to the violent suppression of workers, the deaths of at least ten people, and the crushing of union organizing in the steel industry for 26 years as proof that Carnegie's public support for labor rights was hypocritical.[^156] David Nasaw, Carnegie's biographer, observed that "Carnegie's commitment to giving away his fortune did not make him a more philanthropic employer. On the contrary, he became, if anything, more ruthless in pursuit of profits once he had determined that those profits would be distributed during his lifetime."[^157]

Carnegie's labor practices are condemned for offering low wages and requiring long shifts in unsafe working conditions.[^158] Critics argue that Carnegie deliberately kept wages low to maximize profits that he would later distribute philanthropically, essentially forcing his workers to subsidize his charitable giving.[^159] His "hard driving" management philosophy, celebrated by some as efficiency, is condemned by others as inhumane exploitation that treated workers as expendable resources.[^160]

The contradiction between Carnegie's rhetoric and actions is central to negative assessments. Carnegie publicly proclaimed support for workers' rights to organize, published essays defending unions, and claimed never to use strikebreakers—yet he systematically broke unions, employed strikebreakers, and gave his manager Henry Clay Frick permission to use violence against striking workers.[^161] Critics see this hypocrisy as particularly egregious and argue that Carnegie's philanthropy cannot erase the suffering he inflicted on workers.[^162]

Some scholars question whether Carnegie's philanthropy was genuinely altruistic or primarily motivated by desire for social prestige and legacy-building.[^163] They note that Carnegie's giving only began in earnest after he had accumulated enormous wealth and that his charitable institutions often bore his name prominently.[^164] Critics also argue that private philanthropy, no matter how generous, is an inadequate substitute for fair wages, safe working conditions, and workers' rights to organize.[^165]

Carnegie's monopolistic practices are criticized for stifling competition and creating dangerous concentrations of economic power.[^166] While Carnegie did not hold a complete monopoly on steel production, his vertical integration strategy and economies of scale made it nearly impossible for competitors to survive in large industrial markets.[^167] This concentration of economic power in the hands of a few industrialists is seen by critics as harmful to democratic governance and economic fairness.[^168]

The debate regarding Carnegie's legacy remains unresolved, with the manner in which he achieved his success and treated his workers continuing to be subjects of scholarly scrutiny and disagreement.[^169]
