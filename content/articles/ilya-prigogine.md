## Summary

Ilya Prigogine was a Belgian physical chemist of Russian origin who won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures. He showed that irreversible processes can lead to the emergence of new structures and order from chaos. His work bridged physics, chemistry, and biology and influenced fields from ecology to social science.
