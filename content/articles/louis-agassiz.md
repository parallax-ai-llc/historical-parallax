## Summary

Louis Agassiz was a Swiss-American biologist and geologist who proposed the Ice Age theory, arguing that the Earth had been subjected to a past glacial epoch. His 'Études sur les glaciers' provided evidence that large ice sheets once covered much of Europe. While his glaciation theory was transformative, he controversially opposed Darwin's evolution theory and promoted polygenism and scientific racism.
