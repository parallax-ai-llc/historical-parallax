## Summary

Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) was one of the most influential and controversial philosophers of the 20th century. His groundbreaking work *Being and Time* (1927) revolutionized continental philosophy and profoundly shaped phenomenology, existentialism, and hermeneutics. However, his philosophical legacy remains inseparable from his active support of Nazism during the 1930s and his membership in the Nazi Party from 1933 to 1945. His radical rethinking of ontology—the study of being—influenced generations of thinkers including Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault, while his political affiliations and anti-Semitic statements, particularly those revealed in his posthumously published *Black Notebooks*, continue to generate intense scholarly debate about the relationship between his philosophy and politics.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Martin Heidegger was born on September 26, 1889, in Messkirch, a small town in the Baden region of south-west Germany. He was the son of Friedrich Heidegger, a sexton and cooper at the local Roman Catholic church of St. Martin, and Johanna Heidegger (née Kempf). Though he grew up in humble circumstances, his obvious intellectual gifts earned him religious scholarships to pursue his education.[^4][^5]

In 1903, Heidegger began training for the priesthood and attended the Gymnasium in Konstanz with financial support from the Catholic Church. In 1906, he transferred to the Berthold-Gymnasium in Freiburg. His interest in philosophy first awakened during his high school years when, at seventeen, he read Franz Brentano's dissertation *On the Manifold Meaning of Being according to Aristotle* (1862), which planted the seed for his lifelong preoccupation with the question of Being.[^6][^7]

In 1909, Heidegger entered the University of Freiburg, initially studying Catholic theology with the intention of becoming a priest. However, he soon shifted his focus to philosophy, mathematics, and natural sciences. In 1909, he entered a Jesuit seminary but was discharged within weeks due to heart trouble. This health issue would recur throughout his early life, ultimately preventing him from military service during World War I.[^8][^9]

Heidegger completed his doctoral dissertation in 1913 titled "The Doctrine of Judgment in Psychologism: A Critical-Positive Contribution to Logic," under the supervision of Arthur Schneider. In 1915, he completed his habilitation thesis on "The Doctrine of Categories and Meaning in Duns Scotus," written under the direction of the Neo-Kantian philosopher Heinrich Rickert, which qualified him to teach at the university level.[^10][^11]

During this period, Heidegger encountered the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl through his *Logical Investigations* (1900-1901), which profoundly influenced his philosophical development. This encounter would prove decisive for his future career and philosophical trajectory.[^12]

---

## Rise to Power

Heidegger's philosophical ascent began in earnest when Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, arrived at the University of Freiburg in 1916. Beginning in 1917, Husserl championed Heidegger's work and took him on as his assistant. This mentorship was crucial for Heidegger's early career, providing him with direct exposure to phenomenological method and establishing his credentials within the philosophical community.[^13][^14]

In 1917, Heidegger married Elfride Petri in both Catholic and Protestant ceremonies. The couple had two sons: Jörg, born in 1919, and Hermann, born in 1920. The marriage endured for almost sixty years despite being an "open marriage" in which both partners had extramarital affairs.[^15][^16]

From 1923 to 1928, Heidegger held a position as associate professor at the University of Marburg. These were extraordinarily productive years during which he developed the ideas that would become *Being and Time*. His Marburg lectures attracted brilliant students from across Germany, including Hans-Georg Gadamer, Karl Löwith, Hans Jonas, Hannah Arendt, and Leo Strauss. During this period, from 1924 to 1928, he conducted a clandestine affair with his student Hannah Arendt, who was eighteen years old when the relationship began, while he was a married thirty-five-year-old professor.[^17][^18][^19]

The publication of *Being and Time* (*Sein und Zeit*) in 1927 in Husserl's phenomenological yearbook catapulted Heidegger to philosophical prominence. The work generated a level of excitement that few other works of philosophy have matched, establishing him as one of the leading philosophers of his generation. The book was dedicated to Husserl, and Heidegger acknowledged that his investigation would not have been possible without Husserl's phenomenology.[^20][^21]

In 1928, following Husserl's retirement, Heidegger was elected to succeed his mentor as chair of philosophy at the University of Freiburg, one of the most prestigious philosophical positions in Germany. However, this succession would later become deeply problematic due to Heidegger's subsequent political choices and his treatment of his Jewish teacher.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Heidegger's philosophical contributions fundamentally transformed 20th-century thought. His magnum opus, *Being and Time* (1927), attempted to revive ontology—the study of being—through an innovative analysis of *Dasein*, Heidegger's term for human existence or "being-there." The work introduced a revolutionary approach that challenged the entire Western philosophical tradition from the pre-Socratics through Descartes and Kant.[^23][^24]

In *Being and Time*, Heidegger developed a rich conceptual vocabulary to describe human existence. Key concepts include *Dasein* (being-there), *thrownness* (*Geworfenheit*)—the idea that we are "thrown" into existence without choosing our circumstances—and *being-in-the-world* (*In-der-Welt-sein*), which challenged the traditional subject-object distinction. He distinguished between things that are "ready-to-hand" (*Zuhanden*), encountered transparently in practical engagement, and "present-at-hand" (*Vorhanden*), encountered as objects of theoretical contemplation.[^25][^26][^27]

Heidegger's treatment of *authenticity* and *inauthenticity* became particularly influential for existentialist thinkers. He argued that much of everyday existence is lived inauthentically, in conformity with the impersonal "they" (*das Man*), and that authentic existence requires confronting one's own mortality—what he called "being-toward-death" (*Sein-zum-Tode*). His famous statement that death is "the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Dasein" captures this existential dimension.[^28][^29]

Following *Being and Time*, Heidegger's 1929 works—"What is Metaphysics?," "On the Essence of Ground," and *Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics*—revealed how far he had moved from neo-Kantianism and Husserlian phenomenology toward his own phenomenological ontology. These works established fundamental concepts such as "the Nothing" (*das Nichts*) and further developed his critique of traditional metaphysics.[^30][^31]

In his later philosophy, after what is often called the "turn" (*Kehre*) in his thinking during the 1930s, Heidegger increasingly focused on language, poetry, art, and technology. His profound engagement with the poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin shaped his understanding of language as "the house of Being." He argued that "language itself is poetry in the essential sense," viewing poetic language as uniquely capable of disclosing Being.[^32][^33][^34]

Heidegger's 1950 essay "The Question Concerning Technology" became one of his most widely read works. He argued that modern technology represents a dangerous way of revealing the world, what he called *Enframing* (*Ge-stell*), which reduces everything—including nature and increasingly humans themselves—to "standing-reserve" (*Bestand*), mere resources available for exploitation. He suggested that we might escape this bondage not by rejecting technology but by perceiving its danger and cultivating a different relationship to it.[^35][^36][^37]

His later works also developed the concept of the "fourfold" (*das Geviert*)—the gathering of earth, sky, mortals, and divinities—as a way of understanding how things come to presence. This concept, first presented in 1949, brought together his poetic sensibility with structural concerns into a new figure of thought centered on "dwelling" and "building."[^38][^39][^40]

Heidegger's influence extended far beyond academic philosophy. His work profoundly shaped Hannah Arendt's political philosophy, Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialism, Simone de Beauvoir's feminist thought, Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception, Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics, Jacques Derrida's deconstruction, Michel Foucault's post-structuralism, and the Frankfurt School critical theorists including Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Jürgen Habermas. His influence extended to theology, architecture, literary criticism, psychology, and even the Kyoto School in Japan.[^41][^42][^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism constitutes the most damaging controversy of his career. On April 21, 1933, shortly after Hitler came to power, Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg. Ten days later, on May 1, 1933, he joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP), remaining a member until the party's dissolution in 1945.[^44][^45]

On May 27, 1933, Heidegger delivered his notorious Rectoral Address, "The Self-Assertion of the German University," in a hall decorated with swastikas and attended by SA members and Nazi officials. In this speech, he called for students to render three types of "service" to the state: labor service, military service, and service in knowledge. The address was widely interpreted as a philosophical endorsement of the Nazi regime.[^46][^47][^48]

During his rectorship, Heidegger implemented the *Führerprinzip* (leadership principle) at the university, wrote letters supporting Nazi policies, and participated in book burnings. He resigned the rectorship in April 1934, though he ceased active participation in Nazi Party meetings. However, he never publicly apologized for his Nazi involvement or made a clear statement condemning the Holocaust.[^49][^50]

The denazification hearings after World War II led to Heidegger's dismissal from Freiburg and a teaching ban. In 1949, after investigation, French military authorities classified him as a *Mitläufer* or "fellow traveler" rather than an active Nazi. The teaching ban was lifted in 1951, and he received emeritus status in 1953, but he was never allowed to resume his philosophy chairmanship.[^51][^52]

The publication of Heidegger's *Black Notebooks* (*Schwarze Hefte*) beginning in 2014 reignited the controversy with new intensity. These private writings from the 1930s through the 1970s revealed anti-Semitic passages that incorporated basic tropes of anti-Semitism into his philosophical thinking, assigning "the Jew" or "world Judaism" an antagonistic role in his philosophical project. This demonstrated that his anti-Semitism was not merely personal prejudice but philosophically embedded.[^53][^54][^55]

Heidegger's relationship with his Jewish teacher Edmund Husserl deteriorated after 1933. As rector, Heidegger enforced Nazi racial laws, and Husserl was barred from using university facilities. There are conflicting accounts about whether Heidegger personally intervened on Husserl's behalf, but their relationship never recovered. Husserl died in 1938, having been deeply wounded by his protégé's betrayal.[^56]

The philosopher Karl Jaspers, once Heidegger's close friend, broke with him in 1933 over his Nazi involvement. Jaspers was married to a Jewish woman and felt personally threatened by Heidegger's political choices. Their friendship never fully recovered, though they resumed correspondence after the war. During the denazification process, Jaspers sharply criticized Heidegger's conduct while acknowledging his philosophical contributions.[^57][^58][^59]

From the analytic philosophy tradition, Rudolf Carnap delivered scathing critiques of Heidegger's philosophy. In 1932, Carnap denounced Heidegger as a "musician without musical ability" and applied logical positivism's verification principle to Heidegger's statements about "the Nothing," declaring them literal nonsense. Carnap's attack epitomized the growing continental-analytic divide in Western philosophy, with Heidegger representing everything logical positivists rejected about metaphysics.[^60][^61][^62]

Emmanuel Levinas, who studied with Heidegger before the war, later developed his ethics as an explicit response to what he saw as the ethical failings of Heideggerian ontology. Levinas accused Heidegger's philosophy of being "averse to transcendence and conducive to tyranny," arguing that it failed to recognize the inherent dignity of the human person and represented a form of paganism. For Levinas, ethics must be "first philosophy," not ontology.[^63][^64][^65]

The debate continues among scholars about whether Heidegger's philosophy is intrinsically connected to his Nazism or can be separated from it. Reactions range from those who seek to exonerate him to those who argue his anti-Semitism contaminates all his work. Most contemporary scholars advocate careful reading that neither dismisses the political problems nor simply condemns the entire philosophical project.[^66][^67]

## Personal Life

Heidegger married Elfride Petri on March 21, 1917, in ceremonies officiated in both Catholic and Protestant traditions. Elfride, born July 3, 1893, in Leisnig, Saxony, was the daughter of Captain Richard Petri and Martha Friedrich. The marriage lasted almost sixty years until Heidegger's death in 1976, though it was characterized by openness regarding extramarital affairs on both sides.[^68][^69]

The couple had two sons, though the circumstances were complex. Jörg was born in 1919, and Hermann in August 1920. However, Martin was not Hermann's biological father—Elfride had become pregnant while Martin was working abroad, and her physician and childhood friend Friedel Caesar was the actual father. Both Martin and Elfride knew this, and the marriage continued despite this and other complications.[^70][^71]

Heidegger's most famous extramarital relationship was with his student Hannah Arendt, which began in 1924 when she was eighteen and he was thirty-five. They conducted a clandestine affair in Marburg, using coded notes and light signals to arrange secret meetings. The relationship ended when Arendt left Marburg, but they maintained contact for decades. Their correspondence, sealed until 1995, revealed the intensity and complexity of their connection, which survived even Heidegger's Nazi involvement and Arendt's Jewish identity and exile.[^72][^73][^74]

Beginning in 1922, Heidegger spent significant time at a small three-room cabin (*die Hütte*) that Elfride commissioned to be built in Todtnauberg in the Black Forest Mountains. This simple wooden structure, approximately six by seven meters, became central to his philosophical identity. He worked on many of his most famous writings there, from early lectures to late enigmatic texts. Heidegger claimed an intellectual and emotional intimacy with the building and its surroundings, suggesting the landscape expressed itself through him. His preferred metaphorical register drew heavily from this environment: forests and paths, peaks and valleys, dwellings and clearings.[^75][^76][^77]

Heidegger's personality was complex and often contradictory. He could be a charismatic teacher who inspired profound devotion in his students, yet he was also capable of coldness and betrayal, particularly in his treatment of Jewish colleagues and friends. His letters reveal a man deeply attached to his rural origins and Black Forest environment, yet also driven by philosophical ambition and academic recognition.[^78]

In his later years, Heidegger lived a relatively secluded life, though he continued to lecture occasionally and receive visitors at his hut. Shortly before his death, he met with Bernhard Welte, a Catholic priest and Freiburg professor, and their conversation addressed his relationship to the Catholic Church. Heidegger died on May 26, 1976, in Freiburg and was buried in Messkirch on May 28, 1976, with a Christian ceremony officiated by Welte.[^79][^80]

## Legacy

Martin Heidegger is widely acknowledged as one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century, despite remaining one of the most controversial. His influence on contemporary philosophy is nearly impossible to overstate. Contemporary continental philosophy is indelibly marked by Heideggerian thought, which has had far-reaching implications for phenomenology, hermeneutics, existentialism, deconstruction, aesthetics, the history of philosophy, philosophy of technology, literature, the arts, theology, architecture, and psychoanalytic theory.[^81][^82]

*Being and Time* generated a level of excitement in 1927 that few philosophical works have matched, and it continues to be studied intensively in philosophy departments worldwide. The work's innovative analysis of *Dasein*, authenticity, temporality, and being-toward-death became foundational texts for existentialist philosophy, even though Heidegger himself rejected the "existentialist" label.[^83][^84]

His phenomenological method transformed how philosophers approach questions of human existence and meaning. By insisting that we are always already "being-in-the-world" rather than detached subjects confronting objects, Heidegger fundamentally challenged the Cartesian framework that had dominated Western philosophy since the 17th century. This insight resonates across multiple disciplines beyond philosophy.[^85][^86]

Heidegger's later philosophy of language and poetry profoundly influenced literary theory and criticism. His claim that "language is the house of Being" and his extensive interpretations of poets like Hölderlin, Rilke, and Trakl established new approaches to understanding the relationship between language, truth, and existence. His work became central to hermeneutic philosophy through his student Hans-Georg Gadamer.[^87][^88]

His critique of technology in "The Question Concerning Technology" has become increasingly relevant in our digital age. His warning that modern technology's "enframing" reduces everything to "standing-reserve"—mere resources for exploitation—resonates with contemporary concerns about environmental destruction, commodification, and the dehumanizing effects of technological rationality.[^89][^90]

However, Heidegger's legacy remains irreparably tarnished by his Nazi involvement and anti-Semitism. The publication of the *Black Notebooks* has intensified debates about whether his philosophy can or should be separated from his politics. Many philosophers argue that his thought must be approached critically, with full awareness of its dangerous political implications and connections to his anti-Semitism.[^91][^92]

The question of how to engage with Heidegger's philosophy given his moral failings has no consensus answer. Some argue for complete rejection; others for critical appropriation that turns Heideggerian thought against itself; still others believe his philosophical contributions can be evaluated independently of his biographical failings. This debate shows no signs of resolution.[^93][^94]

Despite the controversies, Heidegger's influence persists in unexpected places. Environmental philosophy, care ethics, Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and even management theory have drawn on Heideggerian concepts. His impact on French philosophy—from Sartre and Merleau-Ponty through Levinas, Derrida, and Foucault—shaped the entire trajectory of post-war continental thought.[^95][^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders and admirers of Heidegger emphasize the revolutionary nature of his philosophical contributions. Hans-Georg Gadamer, his student and the founder of philosophical hermeneutics, viewed Heidegger as the most important philosopher since Plato and Aristotle, arguing that his questioning of Being opened entirely new philosophical horizons.[^97]

Many scholars argue that Heidegger successfully challenged the metaphysical tradition that had dominated Western philosophy for two millennia. By asking about the "meaning of Being" rather than merely cataloging types of beings, he revitalized fundamental ontology and demonstrated that the most basic philosophical questions had been forgotten or covered over by the tradition.[^98][^99]

Philosophers like Hubert Dreyfus argued that Heidegger's analysis of everyday "being-in-the-world" provides insights into human existence that neither scientific naturalism nor traditional phenomenology can match. His account of how we encounter tools "ready-to-hand" in transparent absorption has influenced cognitive science, artificial intelligence research, and embodied cognition theories.[^100][^101]

His later philosophy of technology is praised for providing resources to critique instrumental rationality without falling into simple technophobia or romanticism. Thinkers concerned with environmental ethics and the ecological crisis have found his concepts of "dwelling," "building," and the "fourfold" helpful for reimagining humanity's relationship with nature.[^102][^103]

Even scholars critical of Heidegger's politics often acknowledge his philosophical brilliance. Richard Rorty, though skeptical of Heidegger's grand ontological project, recognized him as one of the three most important philosophers of the 20th century alongside Wittgenstein and Dewey. Jacques Derrida, despite developing deconstruction partially as a response to Heidegger's limitations, considered engagement with Heidegger essential for contemporary philosophy.[^104][^105]

### Negative Views

Critics of Heidegger argue that his philosophy is inseparable from his politics and contains inherent authoritarian and anti-democratic tendencies. Theodor Adorno's *The Jargon of Authenticity* (1964) attacked Heidegger's conceptual vocabulary as obscurantist ideology that disguises reactionary politics in philosophical language.[^106]

Karl Löwith, Heidegger's former student, argued that there was an intrinsic connection between Heidegger's philosophy and his political decision for National Socialism. Löwith contended that Heidegger's emphasis on decisiveness, destiny, and the authentic confrontation with death created a philosophical framework amenable to fascist politics.[^107]

Emmanuel Levinas's ethical philosophy developed explicitly in opposition to what he saw as Heidegger's dangerous prioritization of ontology over ethics. Levinas argued that Heidegger's focus on Being neglects the ethical primacy of the Other and fails to provide resources for resisting totalitarianism. For Levinas, this was not an accidental failing but reflected fundamental problems in prioritizing ontology over ethics.[^108][^109]

Analytic philosophers like Rudolf Carnap and the logical positivists dismissed much of Heidegger's work as literal nonsense—grammatically well-formed sentences that violate logical syntax and therefore lack meaning. Carnap's devastating 1932 critique of Heidegger's statements about "the Nothing" exemplified this rejection, characterizing Heidegger as someone trying to make music without musical ability.[^110][^111]

Feminist philosophers have criticized Heidegger's analysis of *Dasein* as implicitly gendered masculine, failing to account for how gender shapes fundamental structures of existence. His concept of authenticity has been criticized as individualistic and neglecting social dimensions of identity and care relations.[^112]

The publication of the *Black Notebooks* led many scholars to reassess the entire Heideggerian project. Peter Gordon argues that the anti-Semitism revealed in these texts is not peripheral but touches core elements of Heidegger's philosophy, particularly his critique of modernity and technology. This suggests the political problems penetrate deeper than previously acknowledged.[^113][^114]

Tom Rockmore and others argue that the philosophical community has been too willing to excuse or minimize Heidegger's Nazism because of his philosophical stature. They contend that intellectual history would benefit from more honest acknowledgment of how philosophy can serve authoritarian politics, using Heidegger as a cautionary example.[^115]
