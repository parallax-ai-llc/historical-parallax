## Overview

The Corps of Discovery (1804–1806), commanded by **Meriwether Lewis** and **William Clark**, was the first official American expedition to cross the western portion of the continent. Commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson shortly after the **Louisiana Purchase**, the mission was scientific, commercial, and diplomatic. Their primary goal was to find the fabled "Northwest Passage"—a commercially practical water route across the continent. While they failed in this (finding the Rocky Mountains instead), their 8,000-mile odyssey mapped the geography of the West, documented 300 new species of plants and animals, and established the United States' claim to the Pacific Northwest.

## The Commanders & Crew

**Meriwether Lewis (29):** Jefferson's personal secretary. Moody, intellectual, brilliant naturalist, but prone to "melancholy" (depression).
**William Clark (33):** Former army officer. Extroverted, practical, expert mapmaker and boatman. The steady hand to Lewis's brilliance.
**The Relationship:** They shared command *equally*—unheard of in military history. They never quarreled during the 2-year journey.

**Key Members:**
- **York:** Clark's enslaved servant. He was crucial to diplomacy; Native Americans had never seen a black man and believed he possessed "Big Medicine" (power). He was treated as an equal member of the Corps during the trip (voting on decisions), but tragically denied freedom upon return.
- **Sacagawea:** 16-year-old Shoshone girl, kidnapped by Hidatsa, sold to French trapper Charbonneau. She carried her infant son (Jean Baptiste, "Pomp") the entire way.
- **Seaman:** Lewis's 150lb Newfoundland dog. Valuable hunter and guard.

## The Journey Highlights

### The Missouri River (1804)
They rowed a 55-foot Keelboat upstream against the powerful Missouri current. "The hardest work I ever saw."
**First Winter (Fort Mandan, ND):**
Temps dropped to -45°F.
They hired Charbonneau and Sacagawea here.

### The Great Falls & The Divide (1805)
**The Portgage:** The Great Falls of the Missouri were five magnificent waterfalls. But it took them a month to drag their heavy dugouts/gear 18 miles around them over prickly pear cactus.
**The Continental Divide (Lemhi Pass):**
Lewis hiked ahead, expecting to see a river flowing to the Pacific (the Columbia).
Instead, he saw snow-capped mountains stretching to the horizon (The Bitterroots).
**The Shock:** There was no Northwest Passage. Just "immense ranges of high mountains."
**The Shoshone Miracle:**
They needed horses to cross the mountains before winter. They met a Shoshone band. The Chief, **Cameahwait**, began to negotiate. Suddenly, Sacagawea jumped up and wept—it was her brother. The reunion secured the horses.

### The Pacific (Nov 1805)
After starving in the mountains (eating candles and colts), they floated down the Columbia River.
Clark wrote: *"Ocian in view! O! the joy!"*
**Fort Clatsop:**
They built a fort on the Oregon coast.
It rained for 94 of their 106 days there. Clothes rotted off their backs.

## Scientific Discovery

Jefferson (a scientist himself) gave strict instructions.
They described **178 plants** and **122 animals** previously unknown to science, including:
- Grizzly Bear (Lewis chased by one; rifle balls bounced off its skull).
- Prairie Dog ("Barking Squirrel").
- Pronghorn Antelope.
- Coyote.
- Mountain Goat.
They sent a live Prairie Dog and a Magpie back to Jefferson in Washington DC (they survived the trip).

## The Return (1806)

They split up to explore more ground.
**The Only Violence:**
Lewis explored the Marias River and encountered the Blackfeet. It ended in a skirmish; two Blackfeet warriors were killed.
**The Accident:**
Lewis was shot in the buttocks by one of his own men (Peter Cruzatte, who was blind in one eye and thought Lewis was an elk). He spent the rest of the trip lying on his face in a canoe.

## Fate of Lewis

While Clark lived a long, successful life as Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Lewis struggled.
Appointed Governor of Louisiana Territory, he faced political enemies, debt, and severe depression.
In 1809, traveling towards Washington to clear his name, he died of gunshot wounds at a tavern on the Natchez Trace. It is generally ruled a suicide.
