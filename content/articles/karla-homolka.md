## Summary
Karla Homolka, with husband Paul Bernardo, raped and murdered three young women in Ontario, Canada between 1990-1992, including her own sister. She received a controversial 12-year plea deal. Evidence later showed she was an active participant, not merely a victim.

## Early Life
Born May 4, 1970, in Port Credit, Ontario. She worked as a veterinary assistant. She met Paul Bernardo in 1987, beginning a relationship marked by sexual violence. [^1]

## Criminal Career
On December 23, 1990, Homolka drugged her 15-year-old sister Tammy and offered her to Bernardo; Tammy died from aspiration. They kidnapped and murdered Leslie Mahaffy (14) and Kristen French (15) in 1991-1992. Both crimes were videotaped. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
In 1993, she left Bernardo and cooperated with police, portraying herself as an abused accomplice. She received 12 years for manslaughter. Videotapes later showed active participation. Released in 2005; moved to Quebec, then Guadeloupe. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

- Prompted legislative changes

## Negative Perspectives
- Participated in rape and murder of three women including her sister [^5]

- Plea deal widely seen as miscarriage of justice
- Videotape showed willing participation
- Lives freely under new identity
