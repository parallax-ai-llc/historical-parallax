## Summary

Mariano Fortunato Jhocson (October 14, 1877 – March 17, 1928) was a pioneering Filipino educator and entrepreneur who founded what would become National University, one of the Philippines' most significant educational institutions.[^1] At age 23, he established Colegio Filipino in 1900, creating the first private, non-sectarian, and co-educational institution in the Philippines.[^2] His institution was revolutionary for using English as its medium of instruction during a period when Spanish dominated Philippine education.[^3] Jhocson's vision, guided by the philosophy of "Dynamic Filipinism," emphasized developing Filipino leaders with competence, moral values, and nationalist spirit during the critical transition from Spanish to American colonial rule.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Mariano Fortunato Jhocson, affectionately nicknamed "Atoy," was born on October 14, 1877, in Santa Cruz, Manila, as the third child of Crispulo Jhocson and Marcela Alegrado de la Cruz.[^5] His family heritage traced back four generations to Tomas Jocson, with oral tradition suggesting their progenitor was Hoc-Sung from Amoy, China.[^6] Mariano's father, Crispulo, born on June 9, 1850, achieved recognition as a sculptor and woodcarver in Manila, credited with carving the image of La Inmaculada Concepcion (The Immaculate Conception) and creating the pulpit alongside Manuel Flores.[^7]

Growing up in modest circumstances, young Mariano's education began at home, where his mother Marcela taught him to read and write.[^8] From his father's workshop, he learned the value of honest labor and developed an entrepreneurial spirit early. As a student, Mariano displayed remarkable resourcefulness, selling toys like yo-yos carved in his father's shop to earn money for school books and paper.[^9] This early experience with self-reliance would shape his future educational philosophy emphasizing practical skills and self-sufficiency.

The Jhocson household was deeply connected to Philippine revolutionary politics. Mariano's cousin, Feliciano Jocson, was a prominent Katipunero who became Secretary of Welfare in the Departmental Government of Central Luzon under Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary government.[^10] Another cousin, Fortunato, joined the guerrillas during the Filipino-American War.[^11] Given these dangerous revolutionary connections, Mariano and his siblings changed the spelling of their surname to "Jhocson" to avoid harassment from Spanish colonial authorities, though his siblings later reverted to the original "Jocson" spelling while Mariano retained the unique "Jhocson" spelling throughout his life.[^12]

In 1903, Crispulo presented his son with a meaningful woodcarving featuring the Philippine flag, a globe symbolizing arts, books representing letters, a caduceus as symbol of science, and Mother Philippines—a father's blessing for Mariano's educational mission.[^13]

## Education and Early Career

Mariano Jhocson completed his secondary education at the prestigious Ateneo Municipal de Manila in Intramuros, studying during a tumultuous period in Philippine history.[^14] At that time, Ateneo operated under the supervision of the University of Santo Tomas through the Royal Educational decree of 1865 issued by Queen Isabella II, which designated UST as the ex-officio supervisor of all secondary and higher educational institutions.[^15] Despite his father's modest means as a woodcarver, Mariano secured his education by working for the Jesuits in exchange for tuition—an arrangement that demonstrated both his determination and the practical mindset that would later characterize his educational philosophy.[^16]

In 1897, Jhocson received his degree of Bachiller en Artes (equivalent to today's high school diploma) and a certificate as Perito Mercantil (Expert in Business, comparable to contemporary business administration courses) with a grade of Aprobado (passed).[^17] This business education proved instrumental in his later success as both an educator and institutional administrator.

Following his graduation, Jhocson made a significant decision that would distinguish him from his contemporaries: he traveled to Hong Kong to study English and learn Western ways of life.[^18] This journey occurred during the late 1890s, a period of intense political upheaval following the Philippine Revolution of 1896 and the Spanish-American War of 1898. His foresight in acquiring English proficiency positioned him perfectly for the incoming American colonial administration, which would soon introduce English as the language of government and education in the Philippines.

During the revolutionary period, while not directly participating in armed struggle, Jhocson served as a schoolteacher in Mariquina (now Marikina).[^19] This early teaching experience, combined with his business training and English fluency, provided the foundation for his ambitious educational project. Unlike many of his peers who joined the armed resistance, Jhocson chose education as his method of nation-building—a decision that would prove equally transformative for Philippine society.

## Founding of Colegio Filipino and National University

On August 1, 1900, at just 23 years old, Mariano Fortunato Jhocson founded Colegio Filipino in Quiapo, Manila, during one of the most turbulent periods in Philippine history.[^20] The Philippines had just transitioned from Spanish to American colonial rule, and the Philippine-American War raged across the archipelago. In this context, Jhocson's establishment of a private, non-sectarian, co-educational institution represented a revolutionary departure from the educational landscape dominated by Catholic religious orders for over three centuries.[^21]

Colegio Filipino pioneered several groundbreaking features in Philippine education. It was the first private non-sectarian institution, breaking the monopoly of church-controlled schools that had characterized Philippine education under Spanish rule.[^22] The school was co-educational from its inception, allowing both male and female students to study together—a radical concept in conservative early 20th-century Philippine society.[^23] Most significantly, Jhocson made English the primary medium of instruction, replacing Spanish at a time when this transition was still new and controversial.[^24]

The school began humbly with only a handful of students enrolled at the elementary and secondary levels.[^25] However, Jhocson's vision extended far beyond a small neighborhood school. As the institution grew and business courses in bookkeeping and accounting were introduced, the name changed to Colegio Mercantil, awarding the diploma of Perito Mercantil.[^26] This emphasis on commercial education reflected Jhocson's practical orientation and recognition that the Philippines needed trained business professionals for economic development.

Intensely nationalistic and conscious of the country's need to train leaders for eventual self-government, Don Mariano collaborated with the Lacson brothers in 1915 to establish the Philippine Law School, which later became the College of Law.[^27] Jhocson firmly believed that the discipline of Law would produce men and women who would eventually become advocates for Philippine self-government.[^28] This forward-thinking vision demonstrated his understanding that political independence required not just military struggle but also the development of Filipino professionals capable of governance.

In 1916, due to continuous growth and the addition of liberal arts courses, the Board of Trustees changed the institution's name to National Academy.[^29] After 21 years of educational service, on January 17, 1921, the Board of Trustees applied for and secured permission from the Department of Public Instruction to officially change the name to National University.[^30] On that same historic day, the university installed Senator Camilo Osias, one of the Philippines' most respected educators, as the first President of the University.[^31] Under this new structure, the Colleges of Education and Commerce opened in 1921, marking the institution's full transformation into a comprehensive university.[^32]

The choice of Camilo Osias was particularly significant. Osias brought with him the philosophy of "Dynamic Filipinism," which he had articulated in his inaugural speech.[^33] This philosophy, which emphasized nationalism, democracy, and internationalism, perfectly aligned with Jhocson's vision of internalizing all that was best in the Filipino people—warmth, hospitality, innovativeness, and a high emotional quotient that made Filipinos renowned in service-oriented industries.[^34] Jhocson adopted this philosophy as the guiding principle for National University, seeking to instill in students the qualities of competence and leadership, high moral and spiritual values, and the development of each individual into a complete person.[^35]

## Major Achievements and Educational Philosophy

Mariano Fortunato Jhocson's greatest achievement lay in transforming Philippine education during a critical transitional period. His institution pioneered English-language instruction in private higher education, anticipating and adapting to the American colonial education system while maintaining a distinctly Filipino nationalist orientation.[^36] This delicate balance—embracing Western educational methods while preserving Filipino identity—became a hallmark of his approach.

Under Jhocson's leadership, National University became a founding member of the Philippine National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1924, demonstrating his belief in holistic education that developed both mind and body.[^37] When three schools left the NCAA in 1932, National University joined in forming a new athletic association that would eventually become the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) in 1938, one of the most prestigious collegiate sports leagues in the Philippines.[^38]

Jhocson's educational philosophy centered on "Dynamic Filipinism," which he adopted from Camilo Osias. This philosophy was built on three pillars: nationalism, democracy, and internationalism.[^39] It represented an act of patriotism—operating in love for one's country and countrymen—while remaining open to international collaboration and universal culture.[^40] Jhocson emphasized that the nationalization of education should be neither exclusivist nor anti-foreign, but rather should incorporate subject matter and methods that served Filipino development regardless of their origin.[^41]

The curriculum Jhocson developed reflected practical nationalism. He understood that the Philippines needed professionals equipped with both technical competence and civic consciousness. His establishment of business programs, law school, and education college addressed specific national needs during the early American colonial period when Filipinos were gradually assuming more administrative and professional roles.[^42] By 1921, National University offered comprehensive programs across multiple colleges, positioning graduates to become leaders in business, law, education, and public service.[^43]

Jhocson's vision proved remarkably successful. Since its founding in 1900, National University has produced two Philippine Presidents, one National Artist of the Philippines, numerous legislators, politicians, business tycoons, engineers, architects, health professionals, educators, television personalities, and athletes.[^44] This impressive record of alumni achievement validated Jhocson's belief that education focused on leadership, competence, and moral values could transform individuals and, by extension, Philippine society.

His achievement was particularly remarkable given the context. In 1900, Philippine education was in flux. Schools under the Spanish regime had been "strictly sectarian, ungraded school[s], with no prescribed course of study and no definite standards for each year."[^45] The American colonial government was just beginning to establish a free, secular school system with English as the language of instruction.[^46] Into this uncertain environment, Jhocson introduced a private institution that complemented public education while maintaining independence from both government and church control—a model that would inspire numerous other private secular universities in the Philippines.

By the late 1920s, National University had grown significantly, offering programs at all levels from elementary through professional graduate education. It had weathered the disruptions of the Philippine-American War, adapted to changing colonial administrations, survived World War I's economic impacts, and established itself as a permanent fixture in Manila's educational landscape.[^47] This institutional stability represented Jhocson's skill not just as an educator but as an administrator and entrepreneur capable of sustaining a complex organization through turbulent times.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite Mariano Jhocson's significant contributions to Philippine education, his legacy is not without complexities and areas that warrant critical examination. His decision to fully embrace English as the medium of instruction, while pragmatic and forward-thinking, represented a form of cultural accommodation to American colonialism that some nationalist critics viewed as too eager an acceptance of imperial language policy.[^48] While Jhocson framed this as preparing Filipinos for the modern world, critics might argue it contributed to the marginalization of Filipino languages and Spanish literary tradition in favor of the colonizer's tongue.

The establishment of National University as a private, tuition-based institution, while pioneering in its non-sectarian approach, inevitably limited access to those families who could afford fees. Unlike the free public schools established by the American colonial government, Jhocson's institution served primarily middle-class families who could pay for education.[^49] This economic barrier meant that despite his nationalist rhetoric about developing Filipino leaders, his direct impact was concentrated among Manila's emerging middle class rather than the broader population, particularly rural Filipinos who constituted the majority.

Jhocson's close collaboration with American colonial educational authorities and his adoption of their curriculum models could be viewed as complicity with the colonial project. The American colonial education system, which emphasized English and American values, has been critiqued by scholars as a form of cultural imperialism designed to create Filipinos who would accept American rule.[^50] By aligning his institution so closely with this system, Jhocson arguably participated in what some historians have called the "miseducation" of Filipinos—preparing them to serve colonial administration rather than to challenge it.

His hiring of Senator Camilo Osias as university president in 1921, while bringing prestige to the institution, also aligned National University closely with the pro-American political establishment. Osias was known for his moderate, collaborative approach to Philippine-American relations, favoring gradual transition to independence rather than immediate separation.[^51] This political orientation may have influenced the university's culture, potentially discouraging more radical nationalist or independence-oriented perspectives among faculty and students.

The rapid expansion and commercialization of education under Jhocson's leadership, while demonstrating entrepreneurial success, raised questions about whether education was being treated primarily as a business venture. The multiple name changes—from Colegio Filipino to Colegio Mercantil to National Academy to National University—reflected strategic positioning to attract different student markets and offer more profitable programs.[^52] Critics might question whether educational mission or financial considerations drove these transformations.

There is limited historical documentation about Jhocson's position on major political controversies of his era, including the Philippine-American War, labor movements, or peasant uprisings. His apparent political silence on these contentious issues, while perhaps prudent for an institution builder, suggests a preference for accommodation over confrontation with colonial authorities.[^53] This contrasts with the more militant stance taken by his revolutionary relatives, particularly his cousin Feliciano Jocson, who actively resisted colonial rule.[^54]

## Personal Life and Character

Mariano Fortunato Jhocson's personal life reflected the values he promoted in his educational philosophy—family devotion, hard work, and commitment to building institutions that would outlast him. In 1901, shortly after founding Colegio Filipino, Mariano married Consuelo Luciano from Cavite. Together they had two sons: Domingo and Ramon.[^55] Tragically, Consuelo died in 1908, leaving Mariano a widower with two young children at age 31.[^56]

A year after Consuelo's death, Mariano married Miguela Martin, with whom he built a large family. Together they had eight children: Florencia, Recaredo, Remedios, Leticia, Teodoro, Jesus, Mariano, and Pacita.[^57] In total, Jhocson fathered ten children from his two marriages, creating a family legacy that would continue his educational mission for generations. The large household on modest means required the same resourcefulness and entrepreneurial spirit that Mariano had demonstrated since his youth.

Jhocson was described by contemporaries as an untiring worker with ambitious plans for the future of education.[^58] Rafael Palma, who served as President of the University of the Philippines and had been Jhocson's friend since their Colegio Mercantil days, delivered the eulogy at his funeral and praised this tireless dedication.[^59] Those who knew Jhocson remarked on his practical nature, entrepreneurial mindset, and ability to balance visionary thinking with concrete action—qualities essential for building an institution from nothing during turbulent times.

His personality combined the traditional Filipino values instilled by his mother with the progressive, Western-oriented outlook he developed through his English studies in Hong Kong and interaction with American educators. He was intensely nationalistic, as evidenced by his adoption of Dynamic Filipinism and his stated goal of training leaders for Philippine self-government, yet pragmatic enough to work within the colonial system to achieve his educational objectives.[^60]

Family was central to Jhocson's life and legacy. He instilled in his children and grandchildren the importance of continuing his educational mission.[^61] His eldest son Domingo taught accounting at National University and was appointed acting dean of the College of Commerce before becoming university registrar from 1928 until 1936.[^62] Domingo would later become the first alumnus of National University to graduate from Columbia University, fulfilling his father's vision of Filipinos accessing world-class education.[^63]

## Death and Succession

Mariano Fortunato Jhocson's life was cut tragically short when he succumbed to illness on March 17, 1928, at just fifty years old and at the pinnacle of his success as an educator and entrepreneur.[^64] His death came during a period of remarkable growth for National University, and for the first time in the institution's history, commencement exercises did not take place that year, reflecting the depth of mourning and disruption caused by the founder's passing.[^65]

In his final days, fully aware of his approaching death, Mariano called for his wife Miguela and eldest son Domingo. He charged them with continuing the task to which he had dedicated his life—educating the young men and women of his country.[^66] This deathbed commission reflected Jhocson's understanding that institutions outlive individuals, and that leadership succession was essential for preserving his educational legacy.

The funeral brought together prominent figures from Philippine education and politics. Rafael Palma, then President of the University of the Philippines and Jhocson's friend from their earlier years, delivered a moving eulogy describing Mariano as an untiring worker who always had ambitious plans for advancing education.[^67] The presence of such distinguished mourners testified to Jhocson's stature in Philippine educational circles and the respect he commanded across institutional boundaries.

Jhocson died leaving ten children, one of whom had predeceased him.[^68] His widow, Doña Miguela Martin Vda de Jhocson, assumed leadership as National University's comptroller, demonstrating the family's commitment to preserving his legacy.[^69] She faced the enormous challenge of maintaining the institution through the Great Depression and, eventually, the Japanese occupation during World War II. Remarkably, she closed the university during the occupation to avoid Japanese control, then reopened it in 1945 after liberation.[^70]

Domingo L. Jhocson, following his father's deathbed charge, eventually assumed the presidency of National University. After World War II, in 1945, he was formally appointed University President, a position he would hold for 42 years until his death in 1987.[^71] Under Domingo's leadership, National University experienced a "second golden age" in the 1950s, expanding programs and facilities while maintaining the founder's philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism.[^72] Domingo also served as President of the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU) and brought numerous scholars to National University, elevating its academic reputation.[^73]

The successful transition from founder to family leadership ensured institutional continuity, though it also established a dynastic pattern that would characterize National University's governance for decades. The Jhocson family's stewardship preserved Mariano's vision while adapting the institution to changing educational needs and political circumstances through the Commonwealth period, Japanese occupation, post-war reconstruction, and eventual Philippine independence.

## Legacy and Historical Impact

Mariano Fortunato Jhocson's legacy extends far beyond the institution he founded. He pioneered a model of private, non-sectarian, co-educational higher education in the Philippines that numerous other institutions would later emulate.[^74] At a time when Philippine education remained dominated by Catholic religious orders and the emerging American colonial public school system, Jhocson demonstrated that a third path was viable—private institutions that were neither church-controlled nor government-operated, yet served important national development goals.

National University's continued existence and growth more than 125 years after its founding represents Jhocson's most tangible legacy. The institution has evolved from a small colegio with a handful of students to a major university with thousands of students across multiple campuses offering programs from basic education through doctoral degrees.[^75] Its alumni have included two Philippine Presidents and have made significant contributions across all sectors of Philippine society, validating Jhocson's belief that education focused on leadership and competence could transform the nation.[^76]

The philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism that Jhocson embraced and institutionalized continues to influence Philippine educational thought. Its emphasis on internalizing what is best in Filipino culture while remaining open to global knowledge and collaboration represents a balanced approach to nationalism that avoids both xenophobic isolationism and uncritical acceptance of foreign models.[^77] This philosophy has particular relevance for post-colonial societies navigating between preserving cultural identity and participating in globalization.

Jhocson's decision to make English the primary medium of instruction, controversial in his time, positioned his institution and its graduates advantageously as English became the dominant language of commerce, science, and international relations throughout the 20th century. National University's reputation as the first university to use English instruction gave it a distinctive identity and competitive advantage that attracted students seeking preparation for professional careers in an increasingly English-dominated world.[^78]

His entrepreneurial approach to education—treating the university as a self-sustaining enterprise that must attract students, manage finances, and respond to market demands—established a model that many private educational institutions in the Philippines would follow. This approach had both positive and negative implications: it encouraged innovation and responsiveness to societal needs, but also sometimes subordinated educational mission to financial considerations.[^79]

The succession pattern Jhocson established, passing leadership to family members, created a mixed legacy. On one hand, it ensured continuity of vision and institutional stability during turbulent periods, particularly through World War II and the immediate post-war years. On the other hand, it established a dynastic model that limited leadership opportunities for non-family members and potentially insulated the institution from fresh perspectives and necessary reforms.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Educational historians and National University advocates celebrate Mariano Jhocson as a visionary pioneer who democratized access to higher education by breaking the sectarian monopoly that had characterized Philippine education for centuries.[^80] His establishment of the first private non-sectarian, co-educational institution represented a fundamental transformation in Philippine educational access, particularly for middle-class families who could not afford elite religious schools but wanted alternatives to public education.

Scholars of Philippine nationalism recognize Jhocson's contribution to nation-building through education. His emphasis on training Filipino leaders for eventual self-government, particularly through establishing the College of Law, demonstrated a strategic understanding that political independence required developing Filipino professionals capable of governance.[^81] Unlike more militant nationalists who focused exclusively on political or armed struggle, Jhocson pursued institutional development as a form of nationalism—creating enduring structures that would serve an independent Philippines.

Proponents of his legacy emphasize his practical wisdom in adopting English as the medium of instruction. While critics saw this as cultural capitulation, supporters argue it was prescient recognition that English would become the global language of commerce, science, and diplomacy.[^82] His graduates' success in professional fields both domestically and internationally vindicated this decision, they contend, and National University's English-language instruction gave it lasting competitive advantages.

Educational administrators and entrepreneurs view Jhocson as a model of successful institution-building. Starting with virtually nothing—no endowment, no physical plant, no established reputation—he built an institution that survived economic depressions, wars, regime changes, and over a century of educational competition.[^83] His combination of educational vision and business acumen created a sustainable model that balanced mission and financial viability.

Alumni and institutional historians celebrate the concrete achievements of National University graduates as validation of Jhocson's vision. The university's production of two Philippine Presidents, a National Artist, numerous legislators, business leaders, and professionals across all fields demonstrates, in their view, that his educational philosophy successfully developed competent, ethical leaders who contributed significantly to Philippine development.[^84]

### Negative Views and Critical Perspectives

Critics from the political left and anti-colonial perspectives view Jhocson's educational project as fundamentally collaborationist with American imperialism. His rapid adoption of English, embrace of American educational models, and appointment of pro-American figures like Camilo Osias to leadership positions suggest, they argue, that he prioritized accommodation to colonial power over resistance or genuine Filipino independence.[^85] His institution, in this view, helped legitimize American colonial rule by producing Filipinos equipped to serve the colonial administration.

Educational equity advocates point out that Jhocson's model, however innovative, remained accessible primarily to Manila's middle and upper classes who could afford private tuition. His institution did little to address educational inequality or reach the vast majority of Filipinos—rural poor and agricultural workers—who most needed educational opportunities.[^86] The rhetoric of "educating Filipino youth" thus masked a reality of serving primarily privileged urban families.

Linguistic nationalists and cultural critics argue that Jhocson's choice to make English the primary instructional medium contributed significantly to the decline of Filipino languages and the Spanish literary tradition that had flourished in the 19th century.[^87] While pragmatic for his students' career prospects, this decision participated in broader patterns of linguistic imperialism that left the Philippines today with confused language policies and weakened mother tongue education.

Some historians question whether Jhocson's political caution and silence on contentious issues represented genuine neutrality or opportunistic avoidance of positions that might jeopardize his institution. His apparent lack of public stance on the Philippine-American War, labor movements, peasant uprisings, or other major controversies of his era suggests, these critics contend, that institutional preservation took priority over moral leadership on difficult questions.[^88]

Feminist scholars and gender analysts note that while Jhocson pioneered co-education, making National University open to women students, there is limited evidence that he actively promoted women's leadership or challenged patriarchal structures within Philippine society.[^89] Co-education represented practical necessity and market expansion rather than feminist commitment, these critics suggest, and the institution's leadership remained firmly male-dominated throughout his tenure and for decades afterward.

Critics of educational commercialization point to the rapid name changes and program expansions under Jhocson's leadership as evidence that financial considerations often drove decisions rather than purely educational mission. The transformation from Colegio Filipino to Colegio Mercantil to National Academy to National University within just 21 years suggests, they argue, a primarily market-driven approach that treated education as a business commodity rather than a public good or national service.[^90]
