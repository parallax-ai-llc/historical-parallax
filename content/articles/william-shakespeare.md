## Summary

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's preeminent dramatist. His works include 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and several narrative poems. Shakespeare's plays—tragedies (*Hamlet*, *Macbeth*, *Romeo and Juliet*), comedies (*A Midsummer Night's Dream*, *Much Ado About Nothing*), and histories (*Henry V*, *Richard III*)—have been translated into every major language and performed more than any other playwright's. He invented thousands of words still used today, explored universal themes of love, power, jealousy, betrayal, and mortality, and created unforgettable characters. Despite enormous fame, much of Shakespeare's life remains mysterious, fueling debates and conspiracy theories about his authorship.

## Authorship Controversy

Some doubt Shakespeare wrote the plays, citing:
- Limited education
- Few personal documents
- No manuscripts in his hand

**Candidates:**
- Francis Bacon
- Christopher Marlowe
- Earl of Oxford (Edward de Vere)

**Scholarly Consensus:**
Overwhelming evidence supports Shakespeare's authorship. Contemporary references, published works, no credible alternative candidates. Doubt reflects class prejudice (couldn't believe common man wrote such works).
