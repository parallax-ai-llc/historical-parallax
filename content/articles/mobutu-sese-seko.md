## Summary

Mobutu Sese Seko was a Congolese military officer and politician who ruled Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) for 32 years from 1965 to 1997.[^1] Born Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, he seized power in a CIA-backed coup and established one of Africa's most notorious kleptocratic regimes, amassing personal wealth estimated between $50 million and $5 billion while his country descended into poverty.[^2] His rule was characterized by a curious blend of pan-African nationalism through his "authenticity" campaign, strong anti-communist alignment with Western powers, and brutal authoritarian control marked by systematic corruption and human rights abuses.[^3] Mobutu died in exile in Morocco in 1997, just months after being overthrown by rebel forces led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Joseph-Désiré Mobutu was born on October 14, 1930, in Lisala, Belgian Congo, into the Ngbandi ethnic group.[^5] His early life was marked by instability and hardship. His mother, Marie Madeleine Yemo, worked as a hotel maid who had fled to Lisala to escape the harem of a local village chief, where she met and married Albéric Gbemani, a cook for a Belgian judge.[^6] Shortly after their marriage, she gave birth to Mobutu. Tragedy struck when Mobutu was only eight years old—his father died, leaving him to be raised by an uncle and grandfather.[^7]

Despite these challenges, Mobutu received an education that was exceptional for colonial Africans of his era. The Belgian judge's wife took a particular interest in the young Mobutu, teaching him to speak, read, and write fluently in French, the official language of the Belgian Congo.[^8] His mother used her modest earnings to send him to Christian Brothers Catholic boarding schools, demonstrating a commitment to education despite financial constraints.[^9] Mobutu attended primary school at Léopoldville Mission School and secondary school at Coquilhatville Mission School in the provincial capital.[^10] He finished fourth grade when his father died, then spent ten years moving in and out of school as his mother relocated the family to different villages.[^11]

After completing secondary school in Coquilhatville, Mobutu's academic excellence caught the attention of Belgian colonial authorities. In 1948, he was selected to attend the Institut d'Études Sociales de l'État in Brussels, chosen specifically because of his superior intellect and outstanding grades.[^12] This opportunity was rare for Congolese subjects and would prove formative in shaping his worldview. His education in Belgium exposed him to European political thought and administrative systems that he would later adapt to his own purposes.

Upon returning to the Congo, Mobutu began his career in 1949 by joining the Belgian Congolese army, the Force Publique.[^13] Starting as a clerk, he rose through the ranks to become a sergeant major—the highest position then available to Africans in the colonial military structure.[^14] This experience provided him with invaluable military training and connections that would prove crucial to his later political career. After his discharge from the army in 1956, Mobutu transitioned into journalism, becoming a reporter for the daily newspaper L'Avenir and later serving as editor of the weekly publication Actualités Africaines.[^15] Through his work in the press, Mobutu developed relationships with key figures in the emerging Congolese independence movement. It was during this period that he met Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic nationalist leader whose Congolese National Movement (MNC) Mobutu joined soon after its launch in 1958.[^16] This connection would prove to be one of the most consequential relationships in modern African history, though ultimately it would end in betrayal and tragedy.

## Rise to Power

Mobutu's path to absolute power was paved through two military coups, both executed during the chaotic early years of Congolese independence. When the Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960, the young nation immediately descended into what became known as the Congo Crisis—a period of political upheaval, provincial secessions, and Cold War intervention.[^17] Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Congolese Army, found himself at the center of this tumultuous period. His military position and Western connections made him a pivotal figure as various factions competed for control of the resource-rich nation.

In September 1960, just months after independence, Mobutu executed his first coup with the backing of the United States and Belgium.[^18] The CIA had identified Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba as a potential communist sympathizer and viewed him as a threat to Western interests in central Africa.[^19] The CIA "arranged and supported and indeed, managed" Mobutu's coup, providing funding and strategic support.[^20] Mobutu deposed Lumumba's democratically elected government and installed a transitional administration that would ultimately arrange for Lumumba's execution in January 1961—a political assassination that shocked the world and remains one of the most controversial events in African history.[^21] Following this first coup, Mobutu continued to lead the country's armed forces while nominally ceding political authority to civilian leaders, biding his time until conditions allowed him to seize complete control.

The opportunity came in November 1965, when political paralysis gripped the Congolese government. Prime Minister Moise Tshombe's Congolese National Convention had won a large majority in the March 1965 elections, but President Joseph Kasa-Vubu appointed Évariste Kimba, an anti-Tshombe figure, as prime minister-designate.[^22] Parliament twice refused to confirm Kimba's appointment, creating a constitutional deadlock.[^23] On November 24, 1965, General Joseph-Désiré Mobutu led a bloodless military coup, seizing absolute power just one month after his 35th birthday.[^24] In his first speech at Léopoldville's main stadium, Mobutu told the assembled crowd that since politicians had brought the Congo to ruin in five years, it would take him at least that long to set things right—and therefore there would be no political party activity for five years.[^25]

Under the framework of a "regime d'exception" (state of exception), Mobutu assumed sweeping, nearly absolute powers initially intended to last five years.[^26] However, what began as a temporary military intervention would become a 32-year dictatorship. To consolidate his control, Mobutu systematically dismantled democratic institutions and created a one-party state. In 1967, he established the Popular Movement of the Revolution (Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution, MPR) as the sole legal political party, making it the only permissible vehicle for political participation.[^27] This party-state fusion meant that every Congolese citizen was automatically considered a member of the MPR from birth—a totalitarian concept that eliminated any space for political opposition.[^28]

Mobutu received sustained support from Western powers throughout his rise and consolidation of power. The United States, France, and Belgium provided military, diplomatic, and economic assistance, viewing him as a crucial bulwark against communist expansion in Africa during the Cold War.[^29] The CIA paid Mobutu millions of dollars personally and facilitated arms shipments and military interventions to support his rule.[^30] This Western backing allowed Mobutu to eliminate rivals and construct an authoritarian apparatus that would prove remarkably durable, surviving multiple challenges over three decades.

## Major Achievements

Despite the ultimate failure and corruption of his regime, Mobutu implemented several significant initiatives during his 32-year rule, most notably his ambitious "Authenticité" campaign designed to purge colonial influence and forge a distinctly African national identity. Launched in the early 1970s, this cultural revolution sought to rid Zaire of what Mobutu viewed as the lingering vestiges of colonialism and the continuing dominance of Western cultural norms.[^31] The authenticity campaign represented an effort to create a more centralized and singular national identity rooted in pre-colonial African traditions.[^32]

The most visible manifestations of Authenticité were the systematic renaming programs that transformed the country's geography and personal nomenclature. In October 1971, Mobutu renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo as the Republic of Zaire, drawing on the Portuguese corruption of the Kikongo word "nzere" or "nzadi" (meaning "the river that swallows all rivers").[^33] Major cities underwent similar transformations: Léopoldville became Kinshasa, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Stanleyville became Kisangani—beginning June 1, 1966.[^34] These changes symbolically erased the legacy of Belgian King Leopold II and British explorer Henry Morton Stanley, whose names had been monuments to colonial exploitation.

Mobutu extended the authenticity campaign to personal names as well. In January 1972, he changed his own name from Joseph-Désiré Mobutu to Mobutu Sese Seko Koko Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, which translates roughly as "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake."[^35] He ordered all Congolese citizens to abandon their Christian names in favor of African ones, and warned priests that they would face five years' imprisonment if caught baptizing a child with a European name.[^36] In another demonstration of cultural independence, Christmas was officially moved from December to June, which Mobutu declared to be a more "authentic" date.[^37]

The authenticity campaign also included dress codes that rejected Western fashion. Mobutu banned the wearing of Western suits and ties, requiring men to wear a Mao-style tunic known as an "abacost" (a French abbreviation of "à bas le costume," meaning "down with the suit").[^38] Women were forbidden from wearing wigs and pants, and were encouraged to wear traditional African clothing. Mobutu himself became known for his distinctive leopard-skin hat and abacost, creating a powerful visual symbol of his regime.

These cultural initiatives earned Mobutu considerable prestige in Africa and the developing world during the early 1970s.[^39] His advocacy for African cultural pride resonated across the continent during an era when newly independent nations were seeking to establish post-colonial identities. Mobutu positioned himself as a pan-African leader, hosting major international events including the famous "Rumble in the Jungle" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa in 1974, which brought unprecedented global attention to Zaire.

Mobutu also succeeded in maintaining the territorial integrity of Zaire throughout his rule—no small achievement given the country's vast size, ethnic diversity, and resource wealth that attracted various separatist movements and foreign interventions.[^40] During the 1970s, Mobutu's government repelled two invasions of the mineral-rich Shaba Province (formerly Katanga) by Katangese rebels based in Angola, with the assistance of French and Belgian military forces.[^41] As one scholar noted, "the most striking feature" of Mobutu's regime was "a certain genius for survival against all the odds," managing to persist despite record indebtedness, opposition from the Catholic Church, and military threats.[^42]

On the international stage, Mobutu cultivated relationships with multiple U.S. presidents including John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.[^43] He skillfully leveraged his anti-communist stance to secure substantial foreign aid and military support. The United States became the third-largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), providing hundreds of millions of dollars over the decades.[^44] Mobutu's foreign policy also included hosting the Organization of African Unity summit and mediating in various African conflicts, enhancing his stature as a regional powerbroker.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Mobutu Sese Seko's regime became synonymous with kleptocracy—a form of government characterized by rampant corruption where leaders systematically loot state resources for personal enrichment. His systematic plundering of the Congolese national treasury and major industries was so extreme that it helped popularize the term "kleptocracy" in political discourse.[^45] Estimates of Mobutu's personal wealth vary widely, ranging from $50 million to $5 billion, amassed through economic exploitation and corruption during his presidency.[^46] In some years, Mobutu and his cronies siphoned off up to 50% of Zaire's capital budget, along with hundreds of millions in mineral export revenues, foreign aid, loans, and private investment.[^47]

The economic devastation wrought by this corruption was catastrophic for ordinary Congolese citizens. Despite vast mineral wealth including diamonds, cobalt, and copper, extensive oil deposits, and immense hydroelectric and agricultural potential, Zaire's per capita income dropped almost two-thirds from independence in 1960 to the mid-1990s.[^48] By 1996, Zaire was listed as the lowest of all 174 countries in the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report.[^49] The country's economy suffered from uncontrolled inflation, massive debt, and repeated currency devaluations as Mobutu's mismanagement and theft destroyed productive capacity.[^50] Extensive corruption crippled essential public services—roads fell into disrepair, schools lacked basic supplies, and hospitals became dysfunctional.[^51]

Mobutu's quote about corruption revealed his cynical philosophy: "If you want to steal, steal a little cleverly, in a nice way. Only if you steal so much as to become rich overnight, you will be caught."[^52] Yet Mobutu himself violated even this principle, stealing on such a massive scale that his wealth became legendary. He owned palaces across Europe, a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, a private jet, and maintained lavish residences throughout Zaire, including the infamous palace complex at Gbadolite, his ancestral village, which he transformed into a "Versailles in the jungle" complete with an airport capable of landing the Concorde.[^53]

Beyond economic crimes, Mobutu's regime was characterized by pervasive human rights abuses and brutal repression of dissent. His security forces were responsible for extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, rape, and numerous other violations.[^54] Political opponents faced arrest, torture, or execution in a climate of fear that Mobutu carefully cultivated to maintain control.[^55] In 1966, four cabinet ministers accused of plotting a coup were publicly executed in front of 50,000 spectators in a grotesque display meant to intimidate potential challengers.[^56] Earlier, in 1964, rebel leader Pierre Mulele was lured out of exile under the false promise of amnesty. Upon his return, Mulele was subjected to horrific torture while still alive—his eyes were gouged out, his genitals removed, and his limbs amputated.[^57]

Mobutu controlled the media completely, suppressing opposition voices and creating an elaborate cult of personality.[^58] State television and radio broadcast constant propaganda glorifying "the Guide," as Mobutu styled himself. His image appeared on currency, and citizens were required to wear lapel pins bearing his portrait. Party members sang hymns of praise to Mobutu at MPR rallies, and schoolchildren learned songs celebrating his leadership. This totalitarian control of information and systematic personality cult made meaningful political opposition nearly impossible.

The international community's complicity in Mobutu's abuses represents another layer of controversy. Despite overwhelming evidence of corruption and human rights violations, the United States and other Western powers continued supporting Mobutu for decades because of his strategic value during the Cold War.[^59] He was vital to U.S.-backed UNITA rebels' efforts to overthrow the leftist MPLA government in neighboring Angola.[^60] Western governments essentially enabled Mobutu's kleptocracy by providing aid that was routinely diverted to his personal accounts while turning a blind eye to his regime's brutality. This support continued even as Zaire descended into poverty and institutional collapse, raising serious questions about Western priorities and moral responsibility during the Cold War era.

## Personal Life

Mobutu Sese Seko's personal life reflected the excess and complexity of his political career, marked by multiple marriages, numerous children, and a lifestyle of extraordinary luxury financed by state plunder. He was married twice during his lifetime, with both marriages producing large families that became intertwined with his political power structure.[^61]

His first wife, Marie-Antoinette Mobutu, whom he married in 1955, bore him nine children before her tragic death from heart failure on October 22, 1977, in Genolier, Switzerland, at age 36.[^62] Her death deeply affected Mobutu, who had maintained a long relationship with her despite his subsequent affairs. Even before Marie-Antoinette's death, Mobutu had been involved with Bobi Ladawa, who became his mistress and bore him four children: Nzanga, Giala, Toku, and Ndokula.[^63] On May 1, 1980, Mobutu married Bobi Ladawa on the eve of a visit by Pope John Paul II, thereby legitimizing their relationship in the eyes of the Catholic Church and Congolese society.[^64]

Altogether, Mobutu fathered at least fourteen children, though some sources suggest the number may have been as high as 21.[^65] Tragedy struck the family multiple times—four of his sons from his first marriage died: Nyiwa (September 16, 1994), Konga (1995), Kongulu (September 24, 1998), and Manda (November 27, 2004).[^66] One of his sons from his second marriage, François Joseph Nzanga Mobutu Ngbangawe, pursued a political career, running as a candidate in the 2006 presidential elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and later serving as Minister of State for Agriculture in the government.[^67] A daughter, Yakpwa (nicknamed Yaki), was briefly married to Belgian Pierre Janssen, who later wrote a revealing book describing Mobutu's extravagant lifestyle in vivid detail.[^68]

Mobutu's personality was characterized by charm, intelligence, and ruthless ambition. Observers described him as keenly intelligent and diversely educated, capable of charming Western leaders while simultaneously ordering brutal repression of domestic opponents.[^69] He possessed what scholars called "a certain genius for survival," demonstrating remarkable political acumen in navigating complex international relationships and domestic challenges.[^70] His critics described him in terms of his insatiable drive for power, his compulsion to personalize every aspect of the state, and his hunger for adulation.[^71]

His lifestyle was one of spectacular opulence that stood in grotesque contrast to the poverty of ordinary Congolese citizens. Beyond his palaces in Europe and elaborate residences throughout Zaire, Mobutu maintained a personal fleet of luxury vehicles, private aircraft including a Concorde that he occasionally chartered, and accumulated vast collections of art and luxury goods.[^72] His palace at Gbadolite became legendary for its excess, featuring imported marble, elaborate gardens, and infrastructure that far exceeded anything available to the general population. The airport built there could accommodate supersonic jets, allowing Mobutu to travel to Europe for shopping trips while his citizens lacked basic services.

## Legacy

Mobutu Sese Seko's legacy remains profoundly contested, representing one of the most complex and troubling chapters in post-colonial African history. He died on September 7, 1997, in Rabat, Morocco, from prostate cancer, just months after being overthrown and forced into exile by rebel forces led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila in May 1997.[^73] His death came as a seven-month civil war concluded with rebel forces marching into Kinshasa to claim victory.[^74] Mobutu's flight from power marked the end of an era that had profoundly shaped not only the Congo but central Africa as a whole.

The immediate legacy of Mobutu's 32-year rule was a country in ruins. He left Zaire deeply impoverished, politically unstable, and institutionally devastated.[^75] The infrastructure that had existed at independence in 1960 had largely collapsed—roads had become impassable, the education system had deteriorated dramatically, healthcare was virtually non-existent outside major cities, and the economy was in shambles. The systematic corruption and mismanagement that characterized his regime had destroyed the state's capacity to provide basic services or maintain order. His use of state resources for personal gain set a precedent for kleptocratic governance in Africa, and his regime became one of the prime examples of the "Big Man" style of leadership that has plagued the continent.[^76]

Historians characterize Mobutu's rule as marked by authoritarianism, economic failure, and widespread corruption, despite his initial efforts to nationalize resources and promote African identity through his authenticity campaign.[^77] The historical consensus portrays him as one of Africa's most notorious kleptocrats whose authoritarian rule devastated the Democratic Republic of Congo's economy and institutions.[^78] His regime created what scholars call a totalitarian system built on terrorism and institutionalized corruption, sustained only through Western support necessary for his survival.[^79]

However, Mobutu's legacy is not entirely unidimensional. He is also remembered for maintaining the territorial integrity of Zaire throughout his rule—a significant achievement given the country's vast size, ethnic diversity, and the resource wealth that attracted separatist movements and foreign interventions.[^80] During his three decades in power, Zaire did not fracture into smaller states, as happened in several other African countries. His government provided a form of stability, however oppressive, that prevented the complete state collapse that would occur after his departure.

The Congo that emerged after Mobutu's fall descended into what became known as Africa's "World War," with multiple neighboring countries intervening and millions dying in conflict and associated humanitarian crises from 1997 through the early 2000s.[^81] This catastrophic aftermath has led some to argue that while Mobutu's rule was deeply flawed, it at least prevented the total disintegration that followed. This perspective remains highly controversial, as it potentially excuses decades of corruption and abuse by pointing to subsequent chaos that Mobutu's own misrule helped create.

Mobutu's international legacy includes his role as a cautionary tale about Cold War realpolitik. His regime demonstrated how superpower competition led Western democracies to support brutal dictators who aligned with their strategic interests, with devastating consequences for local populations.[^82] The sustained U.S. and European backing of Mobutu despite clear evidence of massive corruption and human rights abuses remains a source of historical controversy and continues to influence discussions about foreign aid, intervention, and the responsibilities of powerful nations toward developing countries.

Within the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mobutu's legacy remains deeply divisive. Some remember the early years of his rule with a degree of nostalgia, recalling a time when Kinshasa had functioning infrastructure and the country had a higher international profile. Others view him as an unmitigated disaster whose theft and mismanagement robbed generations of Congolese of opportunities for development and prosperity. His authenticity campaign's emphasis on African identity and cultural pride continues to resonate with some, even as others see it as hollow propaganda used to mask corruption and oppression.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite the overwhelming criticism of Mobutu's regime, some scholars and observers have identified certain aspects of his rule that merit recognition or have defended particular elements of his legacy. Supporters and some academic analysts have argued that Mobutu's early years in power brought a degree of stability to a country that had been wracked by chaos since independence in 1960.[^83] After the tumultuous Congo Crisis of the early 1960s, which saw secession attempts, foreign interventions, and the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, Mobutu's authoritarian control did establish order, however brutal the methods.

His authenticity campaign, despite its contradictions and use as propaganda, represented a genuine attempt to forge a post-colonial identity and instill pride in African culture at a time when such initiatives were relatively rare.[^84] The cultural nationalism he promoted through the renaming of the country, cities, and people resonated with pan-African ideals that were influential across the continent in the 1970s. His 1972 authenticity campaign gained him wide respect in both Africa and the developing world, positioning Zaire as a leader in African cultural renaissance.[^85] Mobutu's hosting of the "Rumble in the Jungle" boxing match in 1974 brought unprecedented positive international attention to an African nation and demonstrated that Africa could host world-class events.

Some scholars have noted Mobutu's political acumen and survival skills. His ability to maintain power for over three decades in a country as large, diverse, and resource-rich as Zaire—where numerous internal and external actors had strong incentives to overthrow him—demonstrates considerable political intelligence.[^86] Scholar J.B. Wright described the "most striking feature" of Mobutu's regime as "a certain genius for survival against all the odds," noting its persistence despite record indebtedness, opposition from the Catholic Church, and two invasions.[^87]

From a geopolitical perspective, Western supporters argued that Mobutu served as an essential bulwark against communist expansion in central Africa during the Cold War. His firm anti-communist stance and willingness to support Western-backed forces in neighboring countries, particularly in Angola, made him a valued ally.[^88] This strategic value, his defenders argue, justified support for his regime despite its flaws, as the alternative might have been a communist-aligned government that could have destabilized the entire region.

Additionally, some analysts have pointed out that Mobutu's ability to prevent the territorial disintegration of such a vast and diverse country should not be dismissed lightly.[^89] The Democratic Republic of the Congo encompasses hundreds of ethnic groups speaking hundreds of languages across a territory the size of Western Europe. Maintaining national unity in such circumstances, even through authoritarian means, represented a significant achievement that became more apparent after his fall when the country descended into fragmentation and prolonged civil war.

### Negative Views

The scholarly consensus overwhelmingly condemns Mobutu's rule as one of the most destructive regimes in post-colonial African history. Historians and political analysts characterize his legacy as one of corruption, repression, and economic mismanagement on a scale that devastated one of Africa's most resource-rich countries.[^90] His regime became the archetypal example of kleptocracy, where the systematic looting of state resources by the ruler and his associates took precedence over any concern for national development or citizen welfare.[^91]

Critics emphasize that Mobutu's rule represented a betrayal of the promises of independence and self-determination that had animated the Congolese independence movement. He had once been associated with Patrice Lumumba's nationalist movement, but his CIA-backed coup and subsequent arrangement of Lumumba's execution marked him as a collaborator with the very colonial forces that Lumumba had fought against.[^92] This original sin at the birth of his regime colored everything that followed, establishing a pattern of prioritizing personal power and Western interests over Congolese welfare.

The economic devastation Mobutu inflicted remains his most damning legacy. Scholars point out that Zaire possessed extraordinary natural wealth—vast mineral deposits, agricultural potential, and hydroelectric capacity—yet under Mobutu's rule, the country's per capita income fell by nearly two-thirds, making it one of the poorest countries in the world by the 1990s.[^93] This economic collapse was not the result of natural disasters or external shocks, but of systematic corruption and mismanagement. The fact that Mobutu personally accumulated billions while his citizens descended into poverty represents, in the view of most historians, an unforgivable moral crime.[^94]

Human rights scholars and activists have documented the extensive brutality of Mobutu's security apparatus. The 1997 U.S. State Department Human Rights Report on the Democratic Republic of the Congo documented that the Mobutu regime tolerated and committed numerous serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and rape.[^95] The public executions, political assassinations, and systematic use of terror to maintain control marked Mobutu's Zaire as one of the most repressive states in Africa. Critics argue that no claimed achievements in stability or territorial integrity can justify or offset these abuses.

Political scientists have characterized Mobutu's governance as intensely totalitarian, built on exercising terrorism and institutionalized corruption.[^96] His creation of a one-party state where every citizen was automatically a member of the MPR from birth, his pervasive cult of personality, and his control of all media and institutions represented an attempt at total domination that crushed civil society and eliminated space for political development. This totalitarian structure, scholars argue, prevented the emergence of democratic institutions and civil society organizations that might have provided a foundation for better governance after his departure.

Scholars of African politics cite Mobutu's regime as a prime example of neopatrimonial rule and the "Big Man" phenomenon that has hindered African development.[^97] His governance model, based on personal loyalty networks, patronage distribution, and the conflation of state and personal resources, created a system that was fundamentally incompatible with rational-legal administration or economic development. This model influenced other African leaders and became emblematic of the failures of post-colonial governance on the continent.

Finally, historians condemn the international community's complicity in sustaining Mobutu's rule. Western governments, particularly the United States, France, and Belgium, provided billions in aid, military support, and diplomatic backing despite full knowledge of the corruption and human rights abuses.[^98] This sustained support allowed Mobutu to entrench his power and loot his country with impunity. Critics argue that this Cold War realpolitik represented a profound moral failure that sacrificed the welfare of millions of Congolese people for narrow strategic interests, and that this legacy of Western support for dictators continues to undermine development and democracy in Africa.
