## Overview

The Battle of Midway (June 4–7, 1942) was the pivotal naval engagement of World War II in the Pacific Theater. Six months after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), led by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, sought to lure the remaining U.S. aircraft carriers into a trap at Midway Atoll to destroy them decisively. However, thanks to the cryptographic brilliance of U.S. naval intelligence, Admiral Chester Nimitz ambushed the ambushers. In a single day of furious air-to-sea combat, U.S. dive bombers sank four Japanese fleet carriers—the core of Japan's striking power—shifting the strategic initiative permanently to the Allies.

## Preliminaries

### Strategic Context
Japan had swept across the Pacific (Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, Dutch East Indies) with unbroken victories. Admiral Yamamoto believed America's industrial might would eventually crush Japan, so he needed a quick "knockout blow" to force a negotiated peace.
**Objective:** Seize Midway Atoll (1,300 miles from Hawaii) to extend Japan's defensive perimeter and draw out the U.S. carriers (*Enterprise, Hornet, Yorktown*) for destruction.

### Intelligence Coup (Station HYPO)
U.S. Navy cryptanalysts, led by Commander **Joseph Rochefort**, broke the Japanese naval code (JN-25b). They intercepted messages referring to an attack on "target AF."
**The Ruse:** Rochefort suspected AF was Midway. He ordered the base to broadcast an unencrypted message: "Midway water distillation plant breakdown."
**Confirmation:** days later, a decoded Japanese intercept reported: "AF is short of water."
**Result:** Nimitz knew the *where* (Midway), *when* (early June), and *who* (4 carriers).

## Order of Battle

### United States (Admiral Chester Nimitz)
**Carrier Strike Force (Task Forces 16 & 17):**
- **Commanders:** Rear Admirals Frank Jack Fletcher and Raymond Spruance (replacing the sick Halsey).
- **Ships:** 3 Carriers (*USS Enterprise, USS Hornet, USS Yorktown*), 7 heavy cruisers, 15 destroyers.
- **Aircraft:** 233 carrier-based planes + 127 land-based on Midway.
- **Key Weapon:** SBD Dauntless Dive Bomber (the "carrier killer").

### Imperial Japan (Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto)
**Mobile Force (Kido Butai):**
- **Commander:** Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo.
- **Ships:** 4 Fleet Carriers (*Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū*), 2 battleships, 2 heavy cruisers, 12 destroyers.
- **Aircraft:** 248 carrier-based planes.
- **Key Weapon:** A6M Zero Fighter (superior dogfighter), Type 97 Torpedo Bomber.

## The Battle (June 4, 1942)

### 04:30 – 07:00: The First Blow
Nagumo launched 108 planes to bomb Midway Island. They caused damage but failed to neutralize the airfield.
**Dilemma:** Nagumo's scout plane "Tone 4" was delayed. He didn't know U.S. carriers were nearby. He ordered his reserve planes (armed with anti-ship torpedoes) to rearm with land-attack bombs for a second strike on Midway.

### 07:28: The Discovery
Scout plane finally spots U.S. fleet. Nagumo reverses order: "Rearm with torpedoes!"
**Chaos on Decks:** Mechanics frantically swapped munitions. Bombs were left piled unsecured on hangar decks (a fatal mistake).

### 09:20 – 10:20: The Slaughter of Torpedo Squadrons
U.S. TBD Devastator torpedo bombers attacked first. They were old, slow, and had defective torpedoes.
**Carnage:** Japanese Zeros swarmed them.
- *VT-8 (Hornet):* All 15 planes shot down. 29 men died; 1 survivor (Ensign George Gay).
- *VT-6 (Enterprise):* 10 of 14 lost.
**Strategic Impact:** Their sacrifice dragged the Japanese fighter cover (CAP) down to sea level, leaving the skies above the carriers empty.

### 10:22 – 10:30: The "Fatal Five Minutes"
Three squadrons of SBD Dauntless dive bombers arrived at 14,000 feet, unnoticed.
- **USS Enterprise (VS-6, VB-6):** Dove on *Akagi* and *Kaga*.
- **USS Yorktown (VB-3):** Dove on *Sōryū*.

**The Impact:**
1.  **Akagi:** Hit by 1 bomb. Ignited fueled planes and pile of ordnance in hangar. Floating inferno.
2.  **Kaga:** Hit by 4 bombs. Superstructure destroyed.
3.  **Sōryū:** Hit by 3 bombs. Exploded.

**In 5 minutes, 3/4 of Japan's carrier fleet was destroyed.**

### 12:00 – 17:00: The Counter-Punch
The surviving carrier, *Hiryū*, launched strikes.
- **Attack 1:** Zeroes and Val dive bombers hit *Yorktown*.
- **Attack 2:** Kate torpedo bombers hit *Yorktown* again.
The *Yorktown* crew abandoned ship (she sank days later).

### 17:00: The End of Hiryū
U.S. scouts found *Hiryū*. *Enterprise* launched 24 Dauntlesses.
She was hit by 4 bombs. The bow collapsed. Scuttled the next morning.

## Casualties & Losses

| Category | United States | Imperial Japan |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Human Cost** | 307 killed | 3,057 killed |
| **Carriers** | 1 sunk (*Yorktown*) | 4 sunk (*Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū*) |
| **Cruisers** | 0 | 1 sunk (*Mikuma*) |
| **Destroyers** | 1 sunk (*Hammann*) | 0 |
| **Aircraft** | 150 destroyed | 248 destroyed |
| **Pilots/Crew** | Relatively light pilot loss | Irreplaceable loss of elite veteran aircrews |

## Historical Assessment

### Why America Won
1.  **Intelligence:** Knowing the plan allowed Nimitz to gamble.
2.  **Decision Making:** Spruance launched planes early ("calculated risk"), catching Japanese rearming.
3.  **Luck:** The arrival of dive bombers at the *exact second* the Zero cover was at sea level.
4.  **Damage Control:** U.S. crews saved *Yorktown* twice; Japanese crews struggled with fires due to poor ship design (enclosed hangars) and unsafe ordnance handling.

### Significance
Midway was the **turning point**.
- Stopped Japanese expansion.
- Restored naval parity.
- Japan began a defensive war it could not win against U.S. industrial output (Essex-class carriers were coming).
