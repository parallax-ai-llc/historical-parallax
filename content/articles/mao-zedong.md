## Summary
Mao Zedong was a Chinese communist revolutionary who became the founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which he led from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. As Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), he transformed China from a semi-colonial, agrarian society into a major world power, implementing sweeping land reforms and industrialization campaigns. His political theories, known as Maoism, became a guiding ideology for revolutionary movements worldwide. However, his rule was marked by catastrophic policies including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people.

## Early Life
Mao Zedong was born on December 26, 1893, in Shaoshan village, Hunan Province, during the Qing dynasty [^1]. His father, Mao Yichang, was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan through grain trading [^2]. From age eight, Mao attended his village's primary school, where he received a basic education in the Confucian Classics, though he was forced to begin working full-time on his family's farm at thirteen [^1].

Rebelling against paternal authority, including an arranged marriage he never acknowledged, Mao left home to study at a higher primary school and later at a secondary school in the provincial capital, Changsha [^2]. In 1911, he was influenced by Sun Yat-sen's republican ideals and briefly served as a private soldier in the revolutionary army during the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty [^3]. After six months of military service, he resigned in 1912 and enrolled at the First Normal School of Changsha, where he studied until 1918 [^3].

At the First Normal School, Mao received instruction in Chinese history, literature, philosophy, and Western ideas. He was mentored by Professor Yang Changji, who encouraged him to read the radical magazine *New Youth* [^3]. Mao published his first article, "A Study of Physical Culture," in *New Youth* in April 1917 [^3]. After graduation in 1918, he moved to Beijing, where he worked as a library assistant at Peking University under Li Dazhao, one of China's earliest Marxists [^4].

## Middle Years
In July 1921, Mao became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at its First National Congress in Shanghai [^4]. He established a CCP branch in Changsha and worked as a labor organizer throughout the early 1920s [^5]. In 1920, he married Yang Kaihui, the daughter of his former professor, with whom he had three sons [^6].

Following the collapse of the CCP-Kuomintang (KMT) alliance in 1927, Mao led the unsuccessful Autumn Harvest Uprising and retreated to the mountains of Jiangxi Province [^7]. There, with military commander Zhu De, he established the Jiangxi Soviet in 1931—the first territorial base of the Chinese Soviet Republic [^8]. After the KMT's Fifth Encirclement Campaign forced the communists to abandon Jiangxi in October 1934, the Red Army embarked on the legendary Long March [^8].

The 6,000-mile Long March proved transformative for Mao's career. At the Zunyi Conference in January 1935, he emerged as the de facto leader of both the Party and the Red Army [^8]. Of the approximately 86,000 who began the march, only about 8,000 survived to reach the new base in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, in October 1935 [^8]. From Yan'an, Mao directed communist resistance against Japan during the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and built the political and military foundation for eventual victory in the Chinese Civil War [^9].

On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China from Tiananmen Gate in Beijing [^10]. As Chairman, he immediately implemented land reform that redistributed property from landlords to peasants, nationalized industry, and launched campaigns to improve literacy and public health [^11]. In 1958, he initiated the Great Leap Forward, an ambitious but disastrous campaign to rapidly industrialize China through agricultural collectivization and backyard steel production [^12]. The resulting famine between 1959 and 1961 killed an estimated 15 to 55 million people [^12].

## Later Life
Following the catastrophic failure of the Great Leap Forward, Mao withdrew from active economic decision-making, ceding power to pragmatists like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping [^13]. However, in 1966, he launched the Cultural Revolution to reassert his authority and purge those he deemed insufficiently revolutionary [^14]. For the next decade, Red Guards—young radical supporters of Mao—attacked perceived enemies of the revolution, destroyed cultural artifacts, and persecuted intellectuals, causing widespread chaos and an estimated one to two million additional deaths [^14].

In 1972, despite his ideological opposition to capitalism, Mao welcomed U.S. President Richard Nixon to Beijing, beginning the normalization of Sino-American relations [^15]. His health declined significantly in his final years due to Parkinson's disease, congestive heart failure, and Lou Gehrig's disease [^1]. Mao Zedong died on September 9, 1976, at age 82 in Beijing [^1]. His body was embalmed and placed in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square, where it remains on public display.

After his death, Deng Xiaoping emerged as China's paramount leader and initiated market-oriented economic reforms while maintaining CCP political control. The Party's official verdict, delivered in 1981, declared Mao's contributions "primary" and his mistakes "secondary," famously assessing him as "70 percent right and 30 percent wrong" [^16].

## Positive Perspectives
- Unified China after a century of foreign invasions, warlordism, and civil war, establishing the first strong central government since the fall of the Qing dynasty [^17]
- Oversaw dramatic improvements in public health: life expectancy increased from approximately 35-40 years in 1949 to 65.5 years by 1980, one of the most rapid sustained increases in documented global history [^18]
- Launched mass literacy campaigns that reduced illiteracy from over 80% in 1949 to approximately 34% by 1979, described as "perhaps the single greatest educational effort in human history" [^19]
- Built the foundation for China's industrial base, establishing relatively complete and independent industrial and national economic systems by the mid-1970s [^20]
- Improved women's rights through the 1950 Marriage Law, which banned arranged marriages, concubinage, and child marriages while granting women the right to divorce and own property [^21]
- Restored Chinese national sovereignty and international standing, including securing China's permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 1971 [^22]

## Negative Perspectives
- The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) caused the deadliest famine in human history, with scholarly estimates ranging from 15 to 55 million deaths due to starvation, with official Chinese sources acknowledging 16.5 million deaths [^12]
- The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) resulted in widespread political persecution, destruction of cultural heritage, educational collapse, and an estimated 1-2 million deaths, with some estimates significantly higher [^14]
- Established a cult of personality and authoritarian one-party state that suppressed political dissent, freedom of speech, and religious practice [^23]
- The Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957-1959) persecuted an estimated 550,000 intellectuals and political critics, many of whom were sent to labor camps or executed [^24]
- Land reform campaigns in the early 1950s involved mass violence against landlords and wealthy peasants, with death toll estimates ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million [^25]
- Refused to accept responsibility for the Great Leap Forward's failures, instead blaming "rightists" and poor implementation, and launched the Cultural Revolution partly to purge those who criticized his policies [^13]

## Recent News
In December 2023, the CCP held a symposium commemorating the 130th anniversary of Mao's birth at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, where Xi Jinping declared that Mao's thoughts are a "spiritual treasure" that would "guide our actions in the long term" [^26].

In January 2025, China commemorated the 90th anniversary of the Zunyi Meeting, which established Mao's leadership during the Long March. A holographic stage play depicting this historical moment has attracted over 280,000 spectators since its premiere [^27].

Analysts continue to note parallels between Xi Jinping's governance style and Mao's approach, including having his "thoughts" written into the Chinese constitution, emphasizing absolute CCP leadership, and tightening control over the private sector [^28].
