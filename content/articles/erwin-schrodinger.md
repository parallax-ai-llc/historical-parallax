## Summary

Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (1887-1961) was an Austrian-Irish theoretical physicist who developed fundamental results in quantum theory and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.[^1] He is best known for formulating the Schrödinger equation in 1926, which provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time.[^2] His famous thought experiment, Schrödinger's cat, remains one of the most debated paradoxes in physics and philosophy.[^3] Beyond quantum mechanics, Schrödinger made significant contributions to statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, color theory, and molecular biology through his influential book "What is Life?"[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Erwin Schrödinger was born on August 12, 1887, in Vienna, Austria, the only child of Rudolf Schrödinger, a botanist and oilcloth manufacturer, and Georgine Emilia Brenda Bauer, the daughter of Alexander Bauer, a Professor of Chemistry at the Technical College of Vienna.[^5] The family placed great importance on education, creating an intellectually rich environment that would profoundly shape young Erwin's development. His father was described as "his friend, teacher and tireless partner in conversation" who maintained a large personal library.[^6]

Schrödinger's early education was unconventional for the time. He did not attend elementary school but instead received private lessons at home from tutors and his father until the age of ten.[^7] This early home education allowed him to develop a broad intellectual foundation. He learned English and German almost simultaneously, as both languages were spoken in the household, with his maternal grandmother being British.[^8] This bilingual upbringing would later enable him to engage with scientific literature and philosophical traditions from multiple cultures.

At age eleven in autumn 1898, Schrödinger entered the Akademisches Gymnasium, a prestigious grammar school that emphasized classical education, including Latin and Greek.[^9] Despite his primary interest in mathematics and physics, he developed a deep love for classical languages, German and foreign poetry, and became an avid patron of the famous Burgtheater in Vienna.[^10] This classical education cultivated his lifelong appreciation for literature and philosophy, distinguishing him from many of his scientific contemporaries.

In fall 1906, Schrödinger entered the University of Vienna, where he studied under Franz S. Exner and Friedrich Hasenöhrl, who was Ludwig Boltzmann's successor.[^11] During these formative years, Schrödinger came under the strong influence of Hasenöhrl, whose approach to physics emphasized theoretical rigor and mathematical elegance.[^12] He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich "Fritz" Kohlrausch, gaining practical laboratory experience that complemented his theoretical studies.[^13] In 1910, he received his doctorate under Hasenöhrl's supervision, marking the completion of his formal education and the beginning of his scientific career.[^14]

## Rise to Prominence

Following his doctorate, Schrödinger returned to the Second Physical Institute of the University of Vienna in October 1911 as an assistant to Franz Exner.[^15] His academic progress was temporarily interrupted by World War I, during which he served in the Austrian military. Despite the disruption, he completed his habilitation (venia legendi) on September 1, 1914, which granted him the right to teach at universities.[^16]

After the war, in 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie Bertel and took up an academic position as assistant to Max Wien, followed by positions at Stuttgart and Breslau.[^17] In the early 1920s, he accepted a position at the University of Zurich, replacing Max von Laue, where he would settle for six years in what became the most fruitful period of his career.[^18] During his time in Zurich, Schrödinger focused intensely on theoretical physics while also pursuing diverse interests including color theory and statistical mechanics.

The pivotal moment in Schrödinger's career came during the first half of 1926 when he made his greatest discovery: the wave equation that now bears his name.[^19] This breakthrough emerged from his dissatisfaction with the quantum condition in Niels Bohr's orbit theory and his conviction that atomic spectra should be determined by some kind of eigenvalue problem.[^20] Adopting a proposal made by Louis de Broglie in 1924 that particles of matter have a dual nature and sometimes behave like waves, Schrödinger introduced a mathematical framework describing the behavior of such systems.[^21]

In January 1926, Schrödinger published his groundbreaking paper "Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem" (Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem) in Annalen der Physik, presenting what is now known as the Schrödinger equation.[^22] He demonstrated that this equation gave the correct energy eigenvalues for hydrogen-like atoms, solving a fundamental problem in atomic physics.[^23] This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century, creating a revolution in quantum mechanics and transforming physics and chemistry.[^24]

The significance of Schrödinger's wave mechanics was immediately recognized by the scientific community. In 1927, he accepted an invitation to succeed Max Planck at the University of Berlin, where he joined a distinguished faculty that included Albert Einstein.[^25] This appointment placed him at the center of the quantum revolution, surrounded by the leading physicists of his generation. At age 39, he had produced papers that gave the foundations of quantum wave mechanics, establishing himself as one of the foremost theoretical physicists in the world.[^26]

## Major Achievements

### The Schrödinger Equation

Schrödinger's most significant contribution to physics was his wave equation, which provides a fundamental description of how quantum systems evolve over time. Assuming that matter (such as electrons) could be regarded as both particles and waves, Schrödinger formulated a wave equation that accurately calculated the energy levels of electrons in atoms.[^27] This equation became the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding atomic and subatomic phenomena.

The Schrödinger equation is now recognized as the foundation of all atomic physics and chemistry.[^28] It allows physicists to calculate the wave function of a system—a mathematical description that contains all the information about a quantum system—and determine how it changes dynamically in time.[^29] The equation's predictive power and mathematical elegance made it an indispensable tool for theoretical physicists, and it remains central to quantum mechanics nearly a century after its formulation.

### Nobel Prize in Physics

The profound importance of Schrödinger's work was recognized when the Nobel Prize in Physics 1933 was awarded jointly to Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory."[^30] This honor came the same year that Schrödinger left Germany due to his opposition to Nazism, adding a bittersweet dimension to his recognition.[^31] The Nobel Prize cemented his status as one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, placing him alongside Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Dirac as architects of the quantum revolution.[^32]

### Quantum Entanglement

In 1935, Schrödinger coined the term "quantum entanglement" (Verschränkung) to describe a phenomenon in which quantum particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle instantaneously affects the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them.[^33] This concept, which Schrödinger himself found deeply troubling, has become central to quantum information theory and quantum computing. His recognition of entanglement's significance preceded its experimental verification and technological applications by decades.

### Schrödinger's Cat Paradox

Perhaps Schrödinger's most famous contribution to physics and philosophy is his 1935 thought experiment known as Schrödinger's cat.[^34] Designed as an objection to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics championed by Bohr and Heisenberg, the thought experiment illustrates what Schrödinger saw as the absurdity of applying quantum superposition to macroscopic objects.[^35]

In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison. When the radioactive substance decays, the Geiger counter detects it and triggers the hammer to release the poison, killing the cat.[^36] According to the Copenhagen interpretation, until an observer opens the box, the cat exists in a superposition of being both alive and dead simultaneously—a conclusion Schrödinger found "quite ridiculous."[^37]

The paradox addresses the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes, but only one outcome is ever observed.[^38] Far from dismissing quantum mechanics, the thought experiment became part of the foundation of quantum theory itself.[^39] Nearly a century after its formulation, the paradox remains hotly debated among researchers and represents Schrödinger's most enduring legacy in popular science.[^40]

### Contributions Beyond Quantum Mechanics

Schrödinger's scientific interests extended far beyond quantum mechanics. From 1920 to 1926, he wrote extensively on color theory, following in the footsteps of Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, and Hermann von Helmholtz.[^41] He established color metrics in three extended papers submitted in 1920 to the Annalen der Physik, developing both lower and higher color metrics based on the psychology of color perception.[^42]

He also made significant contributions to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, with a particular interest in Ludwig Boltzmann's probability theory.[^43] His papers dealt with specific heats of solids, gas and reaction kinetics, oscillation problems, and the thermodynamics of lattice vibrations.[^44] He gave a comprehensive account of statistical thermodynamics in a monograph and made several attempts to construct a unified field theory.[^45] Additionally, he contributed to the physics of dielectrics, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology.[^46]

### "What is Life?" and Molecular Biology

In 1943, while at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Schrödinger delivered a series of lectures at Trinity College Dublin that would profoundly influence the emerging field of molecular biology.[^47] These lectures were published in 1944 as the book "What is Life?", which sold more than 100,000 copies and ranks among the most influential scientific writings of the twentieth century.[^48]

In the book, Schrödinger proposed that genetic material is an "aperiodic crystal"—a structure with a specific but non-repeating arrangement of atoms that encodes information guiding organism development.[^49] This brilliant intuition anticipated the discovery of DNA's structure. The lectures focused on two main topics: the nature of heredity and the thermodynamics of living systems, introducing the concept of negentropy (negative entropy) in biological contexts.[^50]

The book had a profound and direct impact on the discoverers of DNA's structure. James Watson wrote: "From the moment I read Schrödinger's What is Life I became polarized toward finding out the secret of the gene."[^51] Francis Crick similarly recalled: "Watson and I were once discussing how we came to enter the field of molecular biology, and we discovered that we had both been influenced by your little book What is Life?"[^52] After reading the book, Crick believed a physicist could contribute to solving the secrets of life and joined the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.[^53] Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins—all influenced by Schrödinger's lectures—were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids.[^54]

### Other Honors and Recognition

Beyond the Nobel Prize, Schrödinger received numerous honors throughout his career. He was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1937.[^55] In 1957, he received the Austrian Medal for Arts and Science, and on May 27, 1957, he was accepted into the prestigious German order Pour le Mérite.[^56] He was granted honorary doctorates from numerous universities and became a member of many scientific associations, including the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of London, and the Prussian (later German) Academy of Sciences.[^57]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Opposition to the Copenhagen Interpretation

Despite creating the mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, Schrödinger became one of its most vocal critics. He strongly opposed the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics championed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, famously stating: "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it."[^58] His philosophical convictions, particularly his commitment to space-time continuity and classical physics principles, made him deeply uncomfortable with the indeterministic nature of quantum theory.[^59]

Schrödinger's resistance to the Copenhagen interpretation led him to develop the cat paradox explicitly to ridicule the viewpoints of Bohr and Heisenberg.[^60] His correspondence with Albert Einstein through the summer of 1935 inspired the development of this thought experiment, as both physicists shared concerns about quantum mechanics' implications.[^61] However, Schrödinger's strong philosophical stance also made him a keen and incisive critic, even if his alternative interpretations ultimately failed to gain widespread acceptance.[^62]

Scholars note that Schrödinger apparently changed his mind four times about the interpretation of his wave function.[^63] His own initial interpretation, which he had to abandon after a short time, provides an example of how tentative the meaning of central theoretical terms in revolutionary theories can be.[^64] While none of Schrödinger's positive suggestions appear to have had lasting influence on quantum theory's interpretation, his criticisms forced the physics community to think more deeply about the foundations of quantum mechanics.[^65]

### Flight from Nazi Germany and Political Challenges

In 1933, Schrödinger reached the decision that he could no longer live in Germany after the Nazi Party came to power and persecution of Jews became national policy.[^66] His departure from Berlin marked the beginning of a seven-year odyssey that took him to Austria, Great Britain, Belgium, and the Pontifical Academy of Science in Rome.[^67]

After the 1938 Anschluss (Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria), Schrödinger faced serious problems in Graz due to his 1933 flight from Germany and his known opposition to Nazism.[^68] The University of Graz dismissed him from his post for "political unreliability."[^69] He suffered harassment and was instructed not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to Italy, escaping potential persecution.[^70]

### Personal Life Controversies

The most serious controversies surrounding Schrödinger involve his personal relationships and sexual conduct. Schrödinger maintained an unconventional marriage with Annemarie Bertel, whom he married in 1920.[^71] Despite an unusually open marriage arrangement, she remained with him for the rest of his life.[^72] His affairs with women were seldom casual relationships, and he lived with both his wife and his mistress in what was described as a ménage à trois, which may have caused problems leading to his departure from Oxford.[^73]

Schrödinger had no children with his wife but fathered three daughters with other women.[^74] In 1934, he fathered a daughter, Ruth Georgie Erica, with Hilde March, the wife of his Austrian colleague Arthur March.[^75] When he arrived in Dublin in 1939, he set up home at 26 Kincora Road, Clontarf, with an unconventional family arrangement including his wife Anny, Hilde March, and their daughter Ruth.[^76] While in Dublin, Schrödinger fathered two more daughters by two different women in 1944 and 1946.[^77] His wife Anny tolerated Erwin's numerous affairs throughout their marriage and helped raise his illegitimate daughter Ruth.[^78]

### Allegations of Sexual Misconduct with Minors

The most disturbing controversies involve allegations of sexual relationships with underage girls. Around 1926, at age 39, Schrödinger tutored a 14-year-old girl named Itha Junger, and the lessons reportedly "included 'a fair amount of petting and cuddling.'"[^79] They became lovers after her seventeenth birthday, and in 1932 she became pregnant at age 20.[^80]

Physicist Carlo Rovelli noted that Schrödinger "always kept a number of relationships going at once—and made no secret of his fascination with preadolescent girls."[^81] Walter Moore's biography described an episode in Ireland where Schrödinger was "infatuated" with a twelve-year-old girl, Barbara MacEntee, but desisted from his attentions after receiving "a serious word" from someone.[^82]

An Irish Times article published in December 2021 brought greater public attention to Schrödinger's grooming and abuse of underage girls.[^83] In response, Trinity College Dublin removed a statue of him from public view and renamed the Schrödinger lecture theatre, acknowledging that his scientific contributions cannot excuse his personal misconduct.[^84]

## Personal Life

Erwin Schrödinger married Annemarie ("Anny") Bertel on March 24, 1920, in a Catholic ceremony in Anny's local parish, and again two weeks later on April 6, 1920, in an Evangelical church.[^85] Despite their unconventional open marriage arrangement, Anny remained his faithful companion until his death.[^86] She tolerated his numerous extramarital affairs and even helped raise Ruth, his illegitimate daughter with Hilde March.[^87]

Schrödinger described his personality as having "a good deal of the character of a woman or a child," being easily influenced, changeable, and tending to go to extremes.[^88] Those who knew him described extraordinary intellectual versatility—he was at home in the philosophy and literature of all Western languages.[^89] Beyond physics, he loved classical German and foreign poetry and was an avid patron of Vienna's famous Burgtheater.[^90]

His deep interest in philosophy profoundly shaped his worldview. He was influenced by the works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Baruch Spinoza, and his own metaphysical outlook, as expressed in his last book "Meine Weltansicht" (1961; My View of the World), closely paralleled the mysticism of the Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophy.[^91] This engagement with Eastern philosophy distinguished him from most Western scientists of his era and informed his thinking about consciousness and the nature of reality.

Schrödinger's most productive years were spent at the University of Zurich from 1920 to 1927, but he later described his time in Ireland from 1940 to 1956 as "the happiest of my life."[^92] He acquired Irish citizenship in 1948, demonstrating his commitment to his adopted home.[^93] During his Dublin years, he lived at 26 Kincora Road in Clontarf with his unconventional extended family.[^94]

In 1955, Schrödinger retired from the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, and in 1956 he returned to Vienna, the city of his birth.[^95] He spent his final years in Austria, where he died on January 4, 1961, after a long illness, survived by his wife Annemarie.[^96] Anny died on October 3, 1965, and was buried with Erwin in Alpbach, Austria.[^97]

## Legacy

Erwin Schrödinger's legacy in physics is profound and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of several individuals who can legitimately be called "the father of quantum mechanics."[^98] The Schrödinger equation remains the very foundation of all atomic physics and chemistry, continuing to be used daily by physicists and chemists worldwide nearly a century after its formulation.[^99] His work continues to influence modern research in quantum theory, quantum computing, and quantum information science.[^100]

At a technical level, the Schrödinger equation represents his most enduring legacy, providing the mathematical framework for understanding quantum phenomena.[^101] The equation's elegance and power have made it indispensable to modern physics, from the design of semiconductors and lasers to the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals. Every application of quantum mechanics in technology—from transistors to MRI machines to quantum computers—relies on the foundation Schrödinger established.

In popular science and philosophy, Schrödinger's cat remains his most recognizable contribution. The philosophical issues raised by this thought experiment are still debated today, ensuring that Schrödinger's legacy extends beyond physics into philosophy of science and epistemology.[^102] The paradox has become a cultural touchstone, referenced in popular media, literature, and discussions about the nature of reality and observation.

Schrödinger's influence on molecular biology through "What is Life?" represents an unexpected but significant part of his legacy. The book inspired an entire generation of physicists to enter biology, including Watson and Crick, whose discovery of DNA's structure transformed our understanding of life itself.[^103] This cross-pollination between physics and biology exemplifies Schrödinger's belief that fundamental questions transcend disciplinary boundaries.

His work on quantum entanglement, a concept he coined in 1935, has become central to modern quantum information theory.[^104] What Schrödinger initially viewed as a problematic feature of quantum mechanics is now recognized as a resource for quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. Research into entanglement has led to new technologies and continues to drive cutting-edge physics research.

Schrödinger's intellectual legacy also includes his philosophical contributions. He had a unique knack for blending science and philosophy, urging reflection on the philosophical implications of scientific theories.[^105] His metaphysical writings, particularly his engagement with Eastern philosophy and his ideas about consciousness, have influenced discussions in philosophy of mind and consciousness studies. His famous assertion that "the total number of minds in the universe is one" reflects his engagement with Vedantic philosophy and continues to provoke philosophical debate.[^106]

However, Schrödinger's legacy is increasingly complicated by revelations about his personal misconduct, particularly his relationships with underage girls. The removal of his statue from Trinity College Dublin and the renaming of the Schrödinger lecture theatre there reflect growing recognition that scientific achievement cannot excuse predatory behavior.[^107] This aspect of his legacy presents ongoing challenges for how institutions commemorate historical figures and forces difficult conversations about separating scientific contributions from personal failings.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Schrödinger is universally recognized among physicists as one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics. His 1926 wave equation paper has been celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century, creating a revolution not only in quantum mechanics but in all of physics and chemistry.[^108] Scholars acknowledge that this single contribution fundamentally transformed our understanding of the atomic and subatomic world.

His extraordinary intellectual versatility sets him apart from most scientists. He stands out among physicists of his generation for being at home in the philosophy and literature of all Western languages, demonstrating a breadth of learning rare among scientists.[^109] This interdisciplinary approach enriched both science and philosophy, and his ability to communicate complex ideas to broader audiences—exemplified by "What is Life?"—inspired new fields of research.

The Nobel Committee's recognition of Schrödinger and Dirac "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory" underscores the fundamental importance of his contributions.[^110] His work provided a complete, mathematically rigorous alternative to Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, and the equivalence of the two formulations demonstrated the robustness of quantum theory.

Biographers and historians of science have praised Schrödinger's courage in leaving Nazi Germany and his principled opposition to fascism.[^111] His willingness to abandon prestigious positions on moral grounds, at considerable personal cost, demonstrates integrity that complements his scientific achievements. His time in Dublin proved remarkably productive, showing his resilience and ability to thrive despite political upheaval.

Schrödinger's influence on molecular biology is recognized as transformative. James Watson's and Francis Crick's acknowledgments of his influence demonstrate how his insights crossed disciplinary boundaries and seeded entirely new fields of research.[^112] His concept of the "aperiodic crystal" encoding genetic information was a brilliant intuition that anticipated the structure of DNA, showing his ability to identify fundamental questions beyond his own field.

### Negative Views

Despite his mathematical genius, Schrödinger's interpretations of quantum mechanics are often viewed critically. He apparently changed his mind four times about the interpretation of his wave function, and his own initial interpretation had to be abandoned after a short time.[^113] Scholars note that none of Schrödinger's positive suggestions about quantum theory's interpretation appear to have had lasting influence, even though his criticisms were valuable.[^114]

Some physicists view Schrödinger's philosophical objections to quantum mechanics as stemming from an inability to fully break with classical physics notions. While his strong philosophical convictions made him an incisive critic, they also prevented him from accepting the revolutionary implications of the theory he helped create.[^115] His famous complaint—"I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it"—is sometimes seen as a failure to embrace the full significance of his own work.[^116]

The controversy between Schrödinger and the Göttingen-Copenhagen physicists in the 1950s highlighted fundamental disagreements about quantum theory's foundations. While Bohr's view was drawn from careful assessment of experimental results, Schrödinger's positions were determined by theoretical considerations and commitment to space-time continuity—a difference that some view as dogmatic adherence to classical principles.[^117]

Most seriously, modern historical assessment must grapple with Schrödinger's sexual misconduct and relationships with underage girls. His pattern of pursuing and grooming adolescent girls, documented in biographies and historical records, represents predatory behavior that cannot be dismissed as merely a product of different social norms.[^118] Carlo Rovelli's observation that Schrödinger "made no secret of his fascination with preadolescent girls" indicates behavior that was problematic even by the standards of his own time.[^119]

The decision by Trinity College Dublin to remove his statue and rename facilities bearing his name reflects a reassessment of how we honor historical figures.[^120] While his scientific contributions remain important, institutions are increasingly unwilling to celebrate individuals whose personal conduct violated fundamental ethical standards, particularly regarding the exploitation of minors. This reassessment acknowledges that scientific genius does not grant immunity from moral judgment.

Educational institutions and physics departments face ongoing challenges in how to teach Schrödinger's contributions while acknowledging his misconduct. Some argue that separating the science from the scientist is possible and necessary, while others contend that uncritical celebration of such figures perpetuates harmful patterns and ignores victims' experiences. This tension reflects broader debates about historical memory, accountability, and the relationship between personal character and intellectual legacy.

## Famous Quotes

> "Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else."[^121]

This quote reflects Schrödinger's deep engagement with philosophy of mind and his conviction that consciousness represents a fundamental aspect of reality that cannot be reduced to physical processes.

> "The task is not to see what has never been seen before, but to think what has never been thought before about what you see everyday."[^122]

This saying captures Schrödinger's approach to scientific discovery—recognizing that revolutionary insights often come not from new observations but from reconceptualizing familiar phenomena.

> "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it."[^123]

Schrödinger's famous expression of regret about quantum mechanics reveals his profound discomfort with the probabilistic interpretation of the theory he helped create, showing the conflict between his classical intuitions and the revolutionary implications of his own work.

> "The total number of minds in the universe is one."[^124]

This statement reflects Schrödinger's engagement with Vedantic philosophy and his monistic view of consciousness, suggesting that individual minds are manifestations of a single universal consciousness.

> "The scientist only imposes two things, namely truth and sincerity, imposes them upon himself and upon other scientists."[^125]

This quote expresses Schrödinger's conception of scientific integrity and the ethical foundation of scientific practice.

> "The barrier between [subject and object] cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist."[^126]

This philosophical observation connects to Schrödinger's views on the observer problem in quantum mechanics and his broader metaphysical beliefs about the relationship between mind and world.
