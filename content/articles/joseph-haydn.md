## Summary

Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) was an Austrian composer who became one of the most influential figures in the development of Classical music during the 18th century.[^1] Known as the "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet," Haydn composed 104 symphonies, 68 string quartets, numerous operas, masses, and oratorios that established the structural foundations for these genres.[^2] During his nearly thirty-year service to the wealthy Esterházy family, he produced an extraordinary body of work that influenced Mozart, taught Beethoven, and shaped the course of Western classical music.[^3] His innovative use of sonata form, development of thematic material, and integration of folk music elements into sophisticated compositions made him the most celebrated composer in Europe during his lifetime.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Joseph Haydn was born on March 31, 1732, in Rohrau, a small village on the border between Austria and Hungary.[^5] He was the second son of Mathias Haydn, a wheelwright who also served as the village sexton, and Maria Haydn (née Koller), who had worked as a cook in the palace of Count Harrach before her marriage.[^6] Both parents loved music, and Mathias was a folk musician who had taught himself to play the harp, regularly gathering the family for musical evenings.[^7]

Haydn revealed unusual musical gifts from an early age, displaying both a beautiful singing voice and natural musical aptitude.[^8] When Joseph was not yet six years old, a cousin named Johann Matthias Frankh, who served as a school principal and choirmaster in the nearby city of Hainburg, offered to take him into his home and train him.[^9] The young Haydn left his parental home, never to return except for rare brief visits.[^10]

Life in the Frankh household proved difficult. Haydn frequently went hungry and was beaten regularly.[^11] Later in life, he recalled being embarrassed at the dirty clothing the Frankhs forced him to wear.[^12] Nevertheless, during these formative years he learned the basics of music: how to play the violin and harpsichord, and most importantly for his immediate future, how to sing.[^13]

In 1739, Georg von Reutter, the director of music at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, came to Hainburg on a scouting tour for new talent for his cathedral choirs.[^14] Reutter heard the young Haydn and was deeply impressed, offering him a position as a chorister.[^15] At age eight, Joseph joined the choir school at St. Stephen's, where he received what he later described as a "very deficient education" in general subjects, though he was taught to sing and learned to play the harpsichord and violin.[^16] Haydn himself later admitted that during this period, he "listened more than I studied."[^17]

Haydn did not receive systematic training in musical theory; instead, he educated himself by studying the works of prominent composers like Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, whom he later acknowledged as an important influence.[^18] When his voice changed during adolescence, he was dismissed from the choir and left to fend for himself in Vienna as a struggling freelance musician.[^19]

## Rise to Prominence

After leaving St. Stephen's Cathedral, Haydn spent nearly a decade as a struggling freelance musician in Vienna, teaching, playing in street serenades, and serving as an accompanist.[^20] During this period of hardship, he continued his self-education in musical composition, studying treatises and analyzing the works of masters.[^21] This autodidactic approach, combined with practical experience, shaped his distinctive compositional style.[^22]

Around 1756, Baron Carl Josef Fürnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets.[^23] This early work caught the attention of musical connoisseurs, and through Fürnberg's recommendation, Haydn was engaged in 1758 as musical director and chamber composer for Count Ferdinand Maximilian von Morzin.[^24] For Morzin, Haydn composed his first symphonies, demonstrating his emerging mastery of orchestral writing.[^25]

In 1760, Haydn married Maria Anna Keller, the daughter of a wigmaker.[^26] The marriage proved disastrous from the outset. Haydn had originally been in love with Maria Anna's younger sister Therese, who entered a convent, and only married the elder sister after five years of prompting from her father.[^27] Maria Anna had no sympathy for music and didn't care whether her husband was "a cobbler or an artist," as Haydn later recalled.[^28] The childless marriage eventually dissolved into complete estrangement, though it legally endured until Maria Anna's death in 1800.[^29]

The turning point in Haydn's career came in 1761 when he entered the service of the immensely wealthy Esterházy family, one of the most powerful noble houses in the Habsburg Empire.[^30] Prince Paul Anton Esterházy appointed the relatively unknown Haydn as assistant conductor, and in 1766, following the death of the previous Kapellmeister, Haydn became musical director at the Esterházy court.[^31] This position would define his professional life for nearly three decades.[^32]

As a "house officer" in the Esterházy establishment, Haydn wore livery and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the ancestral seat Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt and later Esterháza, a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s.[^33] While this subordinate position might seem limiting, it provided Haydn with unparalleled resources: a skilled orchestra at his daily disposal, an appreciative and musically sophisticated patron, and the freedom to experiment without the commercial pressures facing composers in major cities.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Haydn's achievements in musical composition are staggering in both quantity and quality. His total output includes 104 symphonies, 68 string quartets, 45 piano trios, over 60 piano sonatas, 14 masses, 26 operas, and numerous other works.[^35] More importantly, his innovations fundamentally shaped the development of Classical music and established forms that would dominate Western art music for generations.[^36]

### Symphonic Innovation

Haydn's symphonies chart the evolution of the genre from simple entertainment pieces to sophisticated dramatic works.[^37] His early symphonies, composed for Count Morzin and the early Esterházy period, were relatively brief works in the prevailing style.[^38] However, over the decades, Haydn continuously expanded the symphony's scope, developing techniques of thematic development, harmonic adventure, and structural sophistication that transformed the genre.[^39]

The period from 1768 to 1774 saw Haydn's maturity as a symphonist, with works inspired by the "Sturm und Drang" (storm and stress) movement, featuring dramatic minor-key works with unprecedented emotional intensity.[^40] His symphonies became more distinctive and boldly individual, establishing him as the preeminent symphonic composer of his age.[^41]

In 1779, Haydn's contract was renegotiated in a watershed moment: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterházy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers.[^42] This change prompted Haydn to shift his compositional emphasis, writing fewer operas and more symphonies and quartets for the international market.[^43] He composed the Paris Symphonies (Nos. 82-87) in 1785-1786 on commission from France, demonstrating his growing international reputation.[^44]

The pinnacle of Haydn's symphonic achievement came with the twelve London Symphonies (Nos. 93-104), composed during his two triumphant visits to England in 1791-1792 and 1794-1795.[^45] These works represent the culmination of the Classical symphony, featuring masterful orchestration, sophisticated development sections, and the perfect balance between learned counterpoint and popular appeal.[^46] Several acquired famous nicknames: the "Surprise" Symphony (No. 94) with its famous fortissimo chord in the quiet slow movement, the "Military" Symphony (No. 100) with its martial second movement featuring trumpets and kettledrums, the "Clock" Symphony (No. 101) with its tick-tocking winds, and the "Drumroll" Symphony (No. 103) with its opening timpani roll.[^47]

### The String Quartet

If Haydn transformed the symphony, he essentially invented the string quartet as we know it.[^48] His 68 string quartets span his entire career and document his continuous innovation in the genre.[^49] Early quartets were relatively simple divertimenti, but Haydn gradually elevated the form into the most sophisticated medium of chamber music, with all four instruments participating as equals in an integrated musical conversation.[^50]

Haydn's mature quartets, particularly the six quartets of Opus 20 (1772), the six quartets of Opus 33 (1781), and the late quartets of Opus 76 (1797) and Opus 77 (1799), represent some of the finest chamber music ever composed.[^51] The "Emperor" Quartet (Op. 76, No. 3) contains as its slow movement variations on the hymn "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" (God Save Emperor Francis), which Haydn had composed in 1797 as an Austrian anthem in response to the French revolutionary threat.[^52] This melody later became the German national anthem.[^53]

Mozart acknowledged that he had learned from Haydn how to write quartets and dedicated a superb set of six such works to his "beloved friend."[^54] The influence flowed both ways, as Mozart's reciprocal influence on Haydn's later work is evident in their imaginative instrumentation.[^55]

### Oratorios and Sacred Music

In his later years, Haydn turned increasingly to sacred music, composing his two monumental oratorios and a series of magnificent masses.[^56] During his visits to England, Haydn was profoundly moved by performances of Handel's oratorios, particularly "Messiah," which inspired him to attempt similar works.[^57]

In collaboration with his librettist and mentor Gottfried van Swieten, and with funding from van Swieten's Gesellschaft der Associierten, Haydn composed "The Creation" (1798), based on John Milton's "Paradise Lost."[^58] For three years, Haydn labored over this work.[^59] When the premiere performance was given in 1798 to selected guests in Vienna, twelve policemen and eighteen mounted guards were necessary to contain the excited crowds of music lovers who thronged outside.[^60] The Creation was a triumph, and Haydn himself declared: "Never was I so devout as when I composed The Creation."[^61]

Haydn followed this success with "The Seasons" (1801), another monumental oratorio.[^62] These works address weighty topics such as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind, representing attempts to render the sublime in music.[^63]

Upon his return from London in 1795, Haydn also began composing his "Six Great Masses" in the service of Prince Nicolaus II.[^64] These masses are pillars of symphonic strength and grandeur, ranging from the brightness of the Missa in tempore belli (1796) to the terse drama of the Nelson Mass in D minor (1798).[^65]

### Contributions to Musical Form

Haydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called sonata form, the structural principle that governed most instrumental music of the Classical and Romantic periods.[^66] He can be thought of as the father of sonata form as a means of structuring works, with his string quartets and symphonies displaying not merely the range of applications of the form, but also how to exploit its dramatic potential.[^67]

It is predominantly Haydn who created the transition to the development section and the transition to the recapitulation as moments of supreme tension and dramatic interest.[^68] His new technique of working with small motifs to tighten the fabric of the sonata form turned the first movement of the sonata, quartet, and symphony into a little musical drama.[^69] Haydn was particularly fond of the monothematic exposition, in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme.[^70]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his universal acclaim during his lifetime and enduring reputation, Haydn has not been without his critics and controversies, both during his life and in subsequent musical historiography.[^71]

### Musical Style Criticisms

Haydn's works are generally joyous and forthright in mood, seldom delving into the complex emotional conflicts favored by Romantic composers, who often despised what they perceived as Haydn's "singleness of style and purpose."[^72] More specifically, Haydn has been rebuffed by some musicians and critics for his style and for the supposed lack of seriousness in his adaptation of folk music to his symphonies.[^73] Romantic-era critics who valued emotional depth and subjective expression sometimes found Haydn's music too cheerful, too conventional, or insufficiently profound compared to Beethoven's dramatic struggles or Mozart's tragic depths.[^74]

### Performance Practice Issues

W. Dean Sutcliffe, a noted Haydn scholar, criticized contemporary Haydn performance practice, noting that "Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music."[^75] This suggests that the apparent simplicity of Haydn's music masks considerable interpretive challenges that many performers fail to address adequately.[^76]

### Relationship with Beethoven

Haydn's teacher-student relationship with Beethoven was not particularly fruitful, as Haydn was very busy with commissions during their time together.[^77] Beethoven was stung by Haydn's criticism of his Piano Trio No. 3, and after this point, Beethoven tended to criticize Haydn's teaching, once commenting, "I never learned anything from Haydn."[^78] This remark, though influenced by Beethoven's prickly temperament, contributed to a perception that Haydn was not an effective pedagogue.[^79]

### Operatic Neglect

While Haydn composed about 20 operas, most have fallen into obscurity, overshadowed by the operatic works of Mozart and later composers.[^80] Haydn himself acknowledged that his operas were too closely tied to the specific circumstances and performers at Esterháza, saying they would not work well elsewhere.[^81] Critics have suggested that Haydn lacked Mozart's dramatic instinct for the stage, though recent scholarship has attempted to rehabilitate some of these neglected works.[^82]

### Attribution Problems

A major scholarly controversy surrounded the enormous number of works wrongly attributed to Haydn.[^83] It was not until the 1950s that musicological research began to pare this staggering amount of spurious attributions from Haydn's recognized output.[^84] It was a major task for scholars of the 20th century to locate and publish all of the works that Haydn composed and to screen out the great number of compositions by other composers that had circulated under Haydn's name.[^85] These studies culminated in Anthony van Hoboken's great catalog of Haydn's compositions, completed in 1978.[^86]

### Marital Troubles and Moral Judgments

Haydn's unhappy marriage and extramarital relationships have been the subject of moral judgments by biographers.[^87] His long relationship with the singer Luigia Polzelli, which began in 1779 when she was nineteen and married, raised eyebrows.[^88] Haydn was probably the father of her son Antonio, and he considered himself committed to a future marriage with Luigia should his wife die.[^89] Some Victorian-era biographers portrayed these relationships as moral failings, though modern scholars tend to view them more sympathetically given the impossible circumstances of his marriage.[^90]

## Personal Life

Joseph Haydn's personal life was marked by the stark contrast between his unhappy domestic situation and his warm, convivial relationships with colleagues, patrons, and friends.[^91]

### Marriage and Relationships

Haydn's marriage to Maria Anna Keller on November 26, 1760, at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna proved to be one of the great disappointments of his life.[^92] Virtually from the outset, the couple proved drastically incompatible.[^93] Maria Anna had a "domineering, unfriendly character," was a spendthrift, and was described as a religious bigot.[^94] It was even rumored that she used her husband's music manuscripts to line pastry tins or curl her hair.[^95] The marriage was childless, and Haydn admitted some responsibility, remarking: "My wife was incapable of having children, and thus I was less indifferent to the charms of other women."[^96]

By the 1770s, Haydn and his wife were completely estranged, and by the 1780s, their marriage had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist.[^97] Maria Anna suffered from severe rheumatism and lived in the spa town of Baden, where she died on March 20, 1800.[^98]

Haydn had a long relationship with the Italian mezzo-soprano Luigia Polzelli, who sang at the Esterházy court starting in 1779.[^99] Though not a particularly able singer, she was kept on staff likely due to her relationship with Haydn.[^100] However, the relationship cooled in 1792 when reports reached Haydn that Luigia had been speaking ill of him and had even sold the piano he had given her.[^101]

A particularly important friendship was with Maria Anna von Genzinger, the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789.[^102] The Genzinger home offered a comfortable, pleasant atmosphere with a woman of high culture who took interest in his compositions.[^103] Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterháza and his happiness for the occasions he was able to visit her in Vienna.[^104] Biographers have debated whether Haydn was in love with Genzinger, with the most likely answer being that he was, but was very aware of how catastrophic the consequences would be if they pursued a romantic connection, and exercised restraint.[^105] Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his F minor variations for piano may have been written in response.[^106]

### Personality and Character

Haydn was known among his contemporaries for his kindly, optimistic, and congenial personality.[^107] His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged.[^108] A modest and unassuming man with a pithy sense of humor, Haydn shaped and consolidated the emerging Classical musical forms.[^109] He seemed incapable of self-pity, and although he exhibited immense confidence rooted in genuine self-respect, there are hardly any reports of him ever being arrogant, cruel, or selfish.[^110]

For much of his life he benefited from a "happy and naturally cheerful temperament," though in his later life there is evidence for periods of depression.[^111] He was given the nickname "Papa Haydn," initially a term of affection bestowed by the musicians who worked for him.[^112] Haydn was especially respected by the Esterházy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer.[^113]

### Humor and Musical Jokes

Haydn had a robust sense of humor, evident in his love of practical jokes and often apparent in his music.[^114] He had high social intelligence and knew exactly how his audience would react to his musical surprises, playing with their expectations for effect.[^115]

The "Surprise" Symphony derives its nickname from Haydn's famous musical joke: a sudden fortissimo chord in an otherwise quiet passage. The composer reportedly said about the abrupt loud chord: "That will make the ladies scream."[^116] In the "Farewell" Symphony (No. 45), the musicians depart the stage one by one until only two are left—a musical protest Haydn used to let his rich, powerful boss know that the court musicians wanted to return home to Vienna from the remote Esterháza palace.[^117] The finale of Symphony No. 60 "Il Distratto" features another famous joke: the energetic opening grinds to a sudden halt followed by a spectacularly discordant orchestral flourish as the violins discover they seemingly need to retune their strings, which they noisily do for 10-15 seconds before resuming.[^118]

### Religious Faith

Haydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his rosary when he got stuck in composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective.[^119] When he finished a composition, he would write "Laus Deo" (praise be to God) or some similar expression at the end of the manuscript.[^120] He once said, "Since God has given me a cheerful heart, He will forgive me for serving Him cheerfully."[^121] About composing "The Creation," he remarked that he felt "impregnated with Divine certainty."[^122]

## Legacy

Joseph Haydn's legacy is immeasurable, touching virtually every aspect of Western classical music and influencing countless composers who followed him.[^123]

### "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet"

Haydn's most enduring legacy lies in his role as the "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet."[^124] He composed 104 symphonies over his long career, establishing the symphony as the preeminent genre of orchestral music.[^125] His innovations in symphonic form—the expansion of the development section, the integration of all movements into a coherent whole, the sophisticated use of orchestral color, and the elevation of the genre from entertainment music to high art—provided the foundation upon which Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, and all subsequent symphonists would build.[^126]

Similarly, Haydn essentially invented the string quartet as a serious artistic medium.[^127] His 68 string quartets established the genre's conventions: the equality of four instruments in conversation, the integration of learned counterpoint with accessible melody, and the quartet as the ideal vehicle for a composer's most intimate and sophisticated thoughts.[^128] Every subsequent quartet composer, from Mozart through Beethoven to Bartók and beyond, worked within the framework Haydn established.[^129]

### Influence on Mozart

Haydn and Mozart shared a remarkable mutual friendship and professional respect characterized by reciprocal influence.[^130] Mozart declared that he had learned from Haydn how to write quartets and dedicated a superb set of six such works to his "beloved friend."[^131] However, the influence flowed both ways: Mozart's reciprocal influence on Haydn's later work, especially the London symphonies, is evident in their imaginative instrumentation, particularly the enhanced role given to woodwind instruments.[^132]

The two composers admired each other genuinely. Haydn told Mozart's father: "I tell you before God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition."[^133] This friendship between two of history's greatest composers stands as one of the most beautiful examples of mutual artistic respect.[^134]

### Influence on Beethoven

Haydn was a teacher of Beethoven, and their relationship significantly shaped Beethoven's early development.[^135] When traveling to London in 1790, Haydn met the young Ludwig van Beethoven in his native city of Bonn.[^136] On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and was Haydn's pupil until the second London journey.[^137]

Haydn's symphonies greatly influenced the musical style of both Mozart and Beethoven; indeed, these two composers learned how to develop motives from Haydn's earlier symphonies.[^138] Haydn's seminal work in the fields of symphony, string quartet, piano trio, and piano sonata had a profound and long-lasting influence on his successors, especially Beethoven (who briefly studied with Haydn in the early 1790s) and Schubert.[^139]

While Beethoven later claimed he learned nothing from Haydn, the influence is undeniable in Beethoven's early works, which clearly show Haydn's structural principles, thematic development techniques, and approach to form.[^140] Beethoven's revolutionary innovations built upon the solid foundation Haydn had established.[^141]

### Development of Sonata Form

Haydn's contributions to sonata form fundamentally shaped how Western music would be structured for over a century.[^142] The development of sonata form into a subtle and flexible mode of musical expression, which became the dominant force in Classical musical thought, owed much to Haydn and those who followed his ideas.[^143] His technique of motivic development—taking small musical ideas and developing them through variation, fragmentation, and recombination—became the standard method of musical composition.[^144]

### International Fame and the Professional Musician

Haydn's career charts radical and foundational changes in how modern music was produced, reproduced, preserved, distributed, and consumed amid the new and disruptive urban capitalism of the late eighteenth century.[^145] His success in negotiating publishing contracts, his profitable London visits, and his ability to gain financial independence through his art helped establish the model of the professional composer as an independent artist rather than merely a noble servant.[^146]

During his lifetime, Haydn became the most famous and celebrated composer in Europe, a status he held from sometime in the 1780s until his death.[^147] His music was performed throughout Europe and even reached the Americas, establishing him as one of the first truly international musical figures.[^148]

### Twentieth-Century Revival

While Haydn's greatness was universally accepted in 1945, his music was popular only in the broadest sense, with few conductors programming even his best-known symphonies with regularity.[^149] However, the twentieth century saw a rebirth of Haydn's reputation and a new appreciation of his greatness.[^150] The historically informed performance movement, beginning in the 1960s and accelerating through the end of the century, brought renewed attention to Haydn's music performed on period instruments with historically appropriate techniques.[^151]

The completion of the Hoboken catalog in 1978 and subsequent critical editions of Haydn's works enabled scholars and performers to explore his vast output more systematically.[^152] The exclusively focused interest in Haydn's instrumental compositions has recently yielded to a more balanced assessment of the oeuvre, with renewed attention to his operas, masses, and other vocal works.[^153]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Haydn's historical reputation has remained remarkably consistent, with scholars and musicians across generations recognizing his fundamental importance to Western music.[^154] The characterization of Haydn's preeminence is made widely in scholarly writing, though different scholars give different estimates for when he held this status.[^155]

Modern musicologists have increasingly emphasized Haydn's originality and innovation. His own famous quote—"There was no one near to confuse me, so I was forced to become original"—captures the unique circumstances that allowed him to develop his distinctive voice.[^156] The relative isolation at Esterháza, rather than limiting him, provided the freedom to experiment and the immediate feedback of a skilled orchestra to test his ideas.[^157]

Scholars praise Haydn's perfect balance between learned and popular styles, his ability to incorporate folk elements into sophisticated compositions, and his inexhaustible inventiveness.[^158] Each of his mature works, whether symphonies, quartets, or masses, displays freshness and originality even within the conventions of Classical form.[^159] The conductor and scholar H.C. Robbins Landon, who devoted his career to Haydn research, emphasized the composer's dramatic instinct, his sophisticated humor, and his profound musical architecture.[^160]

Recent scholarship has highlighted Haydn's role in establishing the modern music business, his shrewd negotiations with publishers, and his understanding of how to cultivate an international reputation.[^161] Rather than being merely a transitional figure between Baroque and Romantic music, Haydn is now recognized as a revolutionary who fundamentally transformed how music was composed, performed, and understood.[^162]

Haydn's optimism and life-affirming spirit have also received scholarly praise. His music reflects Enlightenment ideals: reason, order, wit, and the belief in music's power to elevate and delight.[^163] Even in minor-key works or dramatic passages, Haydn's music ultimately affirms life and joy, reflecting his own declaration: "When I think of my God, my heart dances within me for joy, and then my music has to dance, too."[^164]

### Negative Views

Despite overwhelming scholarly consensus on Haydn's importance, some criticisms have persisted across the centuries.[^165] Romantic-era critics, in particular, found Haydn's music insufficiently emotional or subjective compared to Beethoven's heroic struggles or the passionate outpourings of Romantic composers.[^166] The writer E.T.A. Hoffmann, while praising Haydn, characterized his music as "expressive of childlike serene happiness" in contrast to the "infinite longing" of later Romanticism.[^167]

Some twentieth-century critics argued that Haydn's extreme originality is not always obvious to listeners who come to his music without a clear understanding of its historical context, precisely because Haydn played such a large role in defining what is "normal" in classical music.[^168] This paradox—that Haydn's innovations became so thoroughly absorbed into musical language that they ceased to seem innovative—has sometimes led to his music being taken for granted.[^169]

Performance practice scholars have noted that Haydn's music is often poorly served by performers who treat it as simple or straightforward.[^170] W. Dean Sutcliffe's criticism that most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing physiognomy of Haydn's music suggests that the apparent simplicity masks considerable depth that superficial performances miss.[^171]

Some musicologists have criticized what they perceive as formulaic elements in Haydn's vast output, suggesting that not all 104 symphonies are equally inspired.[^172] The sheer quantity of works he produced, often under commission with tight deadlines, inevitably led to some pieces being more routine than others.[^173] However, even critics who make this argument acknowledge that Haydn's "routine" works display more craftsmanship and invention than most composers' best efforts.[^174]

The neglect of Haydn's operas, while partly due to their circumstantial composition for specific performers at Esterháza, also reflects genuine dramatic limitations compared to Mozart's operatic masterpieces.[^175] Recent attempts to revive these works have had mixed success, suggesting that scholarly reevaluation cannot entirely overturn the judgment that Haydn's greatest achievements lie in instrumental rather than dramatic music.[^176]
