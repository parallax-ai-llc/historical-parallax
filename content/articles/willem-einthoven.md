## Summary

Willem Einthoven was a Dutch doctor and physiologist who won the 1924 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for inventing the first practical electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG). His string galvanometer could precisely measure the electrical activity of the heart. Einthoven's triangle, a system for understanding ECG leads, is still used in clinical practice today. His invention became one of the most important diagnostic tools in medicine.
