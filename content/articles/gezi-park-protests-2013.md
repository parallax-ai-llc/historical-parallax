## Summary

The Gezi Park protests of May-June 2013 began as a small local campaign to save a few trees in Istanbul and exploded into the largest civil uprising in Turkey's modern history. What started on May 28, 2013, as a sit-in to prevent bulldozers from destroying Gezi Park—one of the last green spaces in central Istanbul—rapidly escalated into a nationwide movement involving an estimated 3.5 million people in nearly 5,000 protests across 79 of Turkey's 81 provinces.[^1]

The dramatic escalation was triggered by the brutal police response: tear gas, water cannons, and beatings unleashed on peaceful environmental activists generated waves of solidarity across the country. Taksim Square became a symbol of resistance to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's increasingly authoritarian governance. What had begun as an environmental protest transformed into a broad movement challenging restrictions on press freedom, secular liberties, urban commercialization, and top-down government decision-making.[^2]

Over the course of the protests, at least 22 people were killed and more than 8,000 injured, many severely. The government's response—dismissing protesters as "looters" and "terrorists," suppressing media coverage, and prosecuting thousands—marked a turning point in Turkish politics. Gezi represents both the emergence of a new generation of Turkish civil society and the beginning of the accelerated authoritarianism that would define the following decade under Erdoğan's rule.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Turkey Under the AKP

The Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, came to power in 2002. Initially celebrated for economic growth and democratic reforms (particularly regarding EU accession), by 2013 the government was increasingly criticized for:

- Restrictions on press freedom
- Erosion of judicial independence
- Top-down urban development projects
- Islamization of public life (alcohol restrictions, moral policing)
- Erdoğan's confrontational, polarizing style[^4]

### Urban Transformation

The AKP pursued aggressive urban development, particularly in Istanbul:

- Large-scale construction projects
- Displacement of communities
- Commercialization of public spaces
- Limited public consultation
- Green spaces sacrificed to shopping malls and luxury housing

Gezi Park—adjacent to the historic Taksim Square—was slated for demolition to build a replica of Ottoman-era barracks housing a shopping mall.[^5]

### Taksim Square

Taksim Square holds deep symbolic significance:

- Site of Republic Monument honoring Atatürk
- Historically important for Labor Day celebrations (often banned)
- Heart of secular, modern Istanbul
- Government plans to pedestrianize the square while removing the park enraged urbanists and secularists alike[^6]

## The Protests

### Phase 1: Environmental Sit-In (May 28 - 30)

**May 28, 2013:**
A small group of environmental activists began a peaceful sit-in to prevent bulldozers from uprooting trees in Gezi Park. Their tents were set up to block construction.

**May 30:**
Early morning police raid on the camp:

- Tents burned
- Protesters tear-gassed
- Brutal treatment of peaceful activists

Images of police violence spread rapidly on social media, generating outrage.[^7]

### Phase 2: Solidarity Protests (May 31 - June 1)

Thousands flooded to Taksim Square in solidarity:

- Police responded with massive force: tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets
- Pitched battles in Istanbul streets
- Protests spread to Ankara, İzmir, and dozens of other cities
- "Occupy Gezi" communities formed in the park

By June 1, Gezi Park had become a self-governing community with libraries, kitchens, medical stations, and nightly assemblies.[^8]

### Phase 3: Nationwide Uprising (June 2-15)

The movement expanded dramatically:

**Scale:**

- 3.5 million participants (estimated)

**Composition:**

- Environmentalists
- Secular Kemalists

- Youth previously apolitical

**Demands evolved to include:**

- Protection of Gezi Park
- End to police violence
- Freedom of assembly and press
- Resignation of responsible officials
- End to government overreach in personal life[^9]

### Phase 4: Police Crackdown (June 15-16)

On June 15, police launched a massive operation to clear Gezi Park and Taksim Square:

- Hours of tear gas and water cannon attacks
- Protesters driven out of the park
- Thousands injured

## Government Response

### During Protests

Erdoğan's rhetoric:

- Called protesters "çapulcular" (looters)—reclaimed as badge of pride
- Blamed "interest rate lobby" and foreign conspiracies
- Dismissed concerns as marginal extremism
- Threatened strong response[^14]

### Media Suppression

Turkish mainstream media barely covered the protests:

- CNN Türk famously broadcast a documentary about penguins while Istanbul burned
- Social media (especially Twitter) became primary information source
- Government later targeted Twitter users for prosecution[^15]

### Aftermath Prosecutions

Thousands faced prosecution:

- Over 5,500 prosecuted
- Charges included "membership in a terrorist organization" and "attempting to overthrow the government"
- Osman Kavala arrested in 2017, convicted in 2022, sentenced to life imprisonment
- Doctors who treated protesters, journalists who covered events also targeted[^16]

## Historical Assessment

### Pro-Democracy Perspective

**Defense of Public Space:** Gezi represented citizens demanding a voice in decisions affecting their cities and lives. The movement showed that a diverse, dynamic civil society existed in Turkey, capable of spontaneous self-organization and nonviolent resistance.[^17]

**Turning Point:** The brutal crackdown and subsequent prosecutions marked the beginning of accelerated authoritarianism under Erdoğan, culminating in the post-2016 coup attempt purges and constitutional changes centralizing power in the presidency.[^18]

### Government Perspective

**Official Narrative:** Protesters were manipulated by foreign powers and domestic enemies seeking to destabilize Turkey. The government was defending public order against extremists and provocateurs. Development projects were legitimate and popular.[^19]

---

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Immediate Aftermath

- Gezi Park was saved (temporarily)
- Government made no major concessions
- Prosecutions and repression continued for years
- 2016 coup attempt used to justify further crackdown

### Long-term Impact

**Authoritarian Consolidation:**

- 2017: Constitutional referendum centralizing power
- 2018: Erdoğan becomes executive president
- Press freedom further restricted
- Civil society under systematic attack

**Memory:**

- Gezi remains a symbol of resistance
- Annual commemorations (often suppressed)
- Kavala case became international cause célèbre
- European Court of Human Rights condemned Turkey for Gezi-related violations[^20]

### International Connections

Gezi was part of a global wave of urban protests:

- Occupy Wall Street (2011)
- Indignados in Spain
- Brazilian protests (2013)
- Hong Kong Umbrella Movement (2014)

Shared characteristics: social media coordination, occupation of public space, diverse participation, confrontation with neoliberal urbanism.[^21]
