Marguerite Porete was a French mystic and Beguine who wrote The Mirror of Simple Souls, one of the most remarkable and radical mystical texts of the Middle Ages. The book describes the soul's journey through seven stages of annihilation into union with God. She was condemned as a relapsed heretic by the Inquisition and burned at the stake in Paris. Her book survived anonymously and was attributed to various male authors for centuries.
