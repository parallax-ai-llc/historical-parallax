## Summary

George Pullman invented the Pullman sleeping car and built the Pullman Palace Car Company, which became the largest manufacturer of railroad cars in the world.

The 1894 Pullman Strike, one of the most significant labor conflicts in American history, resulted when he cut wages without reducing rents.
