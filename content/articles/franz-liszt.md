## Summary

Franz Liszt (1811-1886) was a Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, and teacher who became one of the most influential figures of the Romantic period.[^1] He achieved unprecedented fame as a concert pianist during the 1830s and 1840s, inspiring a phenomenon known as "Lisztomania."[^2] Liszt invented the symphonic poem, pioneered thematic transformation, and revolutionized piano technique beyond what had previously been thought possible.[^3] His diverse body of work spanning more than six decades included groundbreaking compositions, transcriptions, and late experimental works that anticipated twentieth-century modernism.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Franz Liszt was born on October 22, 1811, in the village of Doborján (German: Raiding) in Sopron County, in the Kingdom of Hungary, which is now part of Austria.[^5] His father, Ádám Liszt, was an official in the service of Prince Nicolas Eszterházy and played the cello in the court concerts.[^6] Franz began to improvise at the piano from before the age of five, demonstrating extraordinary natural talent.[^7] His father diligently encouraged his progress, and Franz found additional exposure to music through attending Mass as well as travelling Romani bands that toured the Hungarian countryside.[^8]

Franz began to compose at the age of eight, displaying remarkable precocity.[^9] His first public concert was in Sopron in 1820 at the age of nine, and its success led to further appearances in Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia) and for Prince Nikolaus' court in Eisenstadt.[^10] The publicity from these performances led to a group of wealthy sponsors offering to finance Franz's musical education in Vienna.[^11]

In Vienna, Liszt received piano lessons from Carl Czerny, who in his own youth had been a student of Beethoven and Hummel.[^12] For a year and a half, he studied under Czerny and Antonio Salieri, Mozart's one-time rival.[^13] Liszt and his family moved to Paris in 1823, where the young prodigy hoped to attend the Conservatoire de Paris, but director Luigi Cherubini refused his entry as the Conservatoire did not accept foreigners.[^14] Nevertheless, Liszt studied under Anton Reicha and Ferdinando Paer.[^15]

His Paris debut on March 7, 1824, was sensational, cementing his reputation at just the age of thirteen as Europe's virtuosic pianist.[^16] Other concerts quickly followed, as well as a visit to London in June 1824.[^17] He toured England again the following year, playing for George IV at Windsor Castle and also visiting Manchester.[^18] His one-act opera Don Sanche was performed at the Paris Opéra on October 17, 1825.[^19] In 1826 he toured France and Switzerland, returning to England again in the following year.[^20]

## Rise to Power

Liszt's transformation into the greatest piano virtuoso of his generation occurred after attending a concert featuring Niccolò Paganini in April 1832.[^21] Profoundly shaken by Paganini's dazzling display on the violin, Liszt reportedly declared that this performance awakened in him the ambition to become the Paganini of the piano.[^22] He dramatically increased his practice, sometimes practising for up to fourteen hours a day, and in 1838 published the six Études d'exécution transcendante d'après Paganini (later revised as Grandes études de Paganini), aiming to represent Paganini's virtuosity on the keyboard.[^23]

In 1839, Liszt began an extensive tour of Europe, which he continued for the next eight years.[^24] It is estimated that Liszt appeared in public well over one thousand times during this eight-year period, crisscrossing Europe from England to Russia, receiving unprecedented accolades and rewards.[^25] The Lisztomania frenzy first occurred in Berlin in 1841, and the term was later coined by Heinrich Heine in a feuilleton he wrote on April 25, 1844.[^26]

Lisztomania was characterized by intense levels of hysteria demonstrated by fans, akin to the treatment of some celebrity musicians starting in the second half of the twentieth century—but in a time not known for such musical excitement.[^27] In a fashion described as similar to "the mass hysteria associated with revivalist meetings or 20th-century rock stars," women fought over his cigar stubs and coffee dregs, and his silk handkerchiefs and velvet gloves, which they ripped to shreds as souvenirs.[^28] This atmosphere was fueled in great part by the artist's mesmeric personality and stage presence: he was regarded as handsome, and Heine noted his powerful physical appearance during concerts.[^29]

Liszt is credited as the first pianist to give solo recitals in the modern sense of the word; the term was first applied to Liszt's concert at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on June 9, 1840.[^30] During his years as a travelling virtuoso, Liszt performed an enormous amount of music, usually from memory.[^31] He was the first to include the full range of repertoire, from J.S. Bach to Chopin.[^32] By retiring from the concert platform at the age of 35, while still at the height of his powers, Liszt succeeded in keeping the legend of his playing untarnished.[^33]

In July 1848, Liszt settled in Weimar, where he had been appointed the honorary title of "Kapellmeister Extraordinaire" six years previously.[^34] He acted as the official court kapellmeister at the expense of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia until 1859, jointly with Hippolyte André Jean Baptiste Chélard until his retirement in 1852.[^35]

## Major Achievements

### Revolutionary Piano Technique

Liszt's contributions to piano technique were transformative and enduring. His Paganini Études and Transcendental Études extended piano technique beyond what had previously been thought possible.[^36] Robert Schumann described them as "playable at the most, by ten or twelve players in the world."[^37] It was in the Paganini and the Transcendental Études that the technical foundation for modern pianism was laid.[^38] Saint-Saëns declared, without exaggeration, that Liszt's influence on the piano was so great that he knew of nothing comparable to it except the revolution in the mechanism of the French language brought about by Victor Hugo.[^39]

### Invention of the Symphonic Poem

During his Weimar years, Liszt invented the symphonic poem, an extended programmatic work for orchestra.[^40] This was one of Liszt's most significant contributions to music, pioneering single-movement orchestral works based on extra-musical ideas, like poetry or literature (e.g., Les Préludes).[^41] Liszt's invention of the symphonic poem had an impact across Europe from the last years of his life through to the 1920s.[^42] His friend Saint-Saëns wrote Le Rouet d'Omphale in 1869 and La jeunesse d'Hercule in 1877; Smetana wrote Má vlast in the 1870s.[^43] Franck, d'Indy, Dvořák and Debussy all wrote symphonic poems in the 1880s and 1890s.[^44]

Famous premieres at Weimar include Lohengrin, Alfonso und Estrella and Der Barbier von Baghdad, and famous revivals include Der fliegende Holländer, Tannhäuser, Fidelio, La favorite, Ernani and Benvenuto Cellini.[^45] Liszt's work during this period made Weimar a nexus for modern music.[^46]

### Major Compositions

Among his many notable compositions are his twelve symphonic poems, two (completed) piano concerti, several sacred choral works, and a great variety of solo piano pieces.[^47] His renowned piano cycles Années de pèlerinage (Years of Pilgrimage) are widely considered as the masterwork and summation of Liszt's musical style.[^48] The works were inspired by Liszt's travels with Marie d'Agoult during 1835-1839 through Switzerland and Italy.[^49]

The Piano Sonata in B minor (S.178), completed in 1853, is regarded by many as his ultimate masterpiece and ranks alongside other "greats" in the pantheon of piano repertoire.[^50] Although greeted at first with doubt and hostility, it is now widely accepted as the summit of the entire Romantic piano repertory.[^51] Liszt departed from Classical sonata form and achieved the most significant formal advancement in the solo piano sonata since Beethoven's late period, combining the traditional four-movement sonata into one single-movement work.[^52]

The Hungarian Rhapsodies, S.244, are a set of nineteen piano pieces based on Hungarian folk themes, composed by Liszt during 1846–1853, and later in 1882 and 1885.[^53] During the Weimar period he composed the first fifteen Hungarian Rhapsodies, themselves revisions of his earlier Magyar Dalok/Rhapsódiák, which were influenced by the Romani bands he heard while visiting Hungary.[^54]

The Dante and Faust symphonies are the only symphonies Liszt ever composed, and they are often recorded together.[^55] The Faust Symphony has long been recognised as Liszt's greatest orchestral work, and it ranks with the B minor Piano Sonata and the oratorio Christus as the noblest of his musical achievements.[^56] The Dante Symphony was based on Dante Alighieri's journey through Hell and Purgatory, as depicted in The Divine Comedy.[^57]

Liszt composed two grandiose oratorios: Die Legende von der heiligen Elisabeth (The Legend of St. Elisabeth) and Christus, both of which are long works.[^58] Most commentators agree that Christus as a whole contains, along with the Piano Sonata and the Faust-Symphonie, the best of Liszt's music.[^59]

### Transcriptions and Arrangements

Franz Liszt probably did more than any other composer for the genre of the piano transcription, with their technical challenges, innovative notation, and complex pianistic and dramatic effects.[^60] He transcribed the complete Beethoven symphonies for piano over a quarter of a century, reflecting his spiritual, well-nigh religious admiration for the older composer.[^61] His transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies allowed the home player to enjoy these great works from the comfort of the parlour or salon.[^62]

Liszt transcribed some sixty of Schubert's songs for solo piano and in doing so helped popularise the then obscure works of Schubert.[^63] The song transcriptions show remarkable inventiveness in preserving both the vocal line and the full richness of the accompaniment.[^64] In his transcriptions of Bach's organ works, Liszt used rapid passage work and cascading double octaves to create deep resonance in the bass, akin to the rich sound of a mighty church organ.[^65]

### Musical Innovations

Liszt pioneered the technique of thematic transformation, a method of development which was related to both the existing variation technique and to the new use of the Leitmotif by Richard Wagner.[^66] While the technique had precedents, Liszt perfected the creation of significantly longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation, not only in the symphonic poems but in other works such as his Second Piano Concerto and his Piano Sonata in B minor.[^67]

Among Liszt's musical contributions were the concept of the symphonic poem, innovations in thematic transformation and Impressionism in music, and the invention of the masterclass as a method of teaching performance.[^68] Many of Liszt's later works also feature experiments in atonality, foreshadowing developments in twentieth-century classical music.[^69]

### Conducting Innovations

Liszt, along with Berlioz and Wagner, invented the modern art of interpretive conducting, originating many of the body gestures that are used by today's conductors and championing the use of modified tempo, called tempo rubato.[^70] Liszt developed a system of highly demonstrative gestures to communicate more clearly his expressive intent to the orchestra members during his work with the Weimar orchestra.[^71] His economical conducting style was captured in his philosophy: "We are helmsmen, not oarsmen!"[^72]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Franz Liszt was a lightning rod for controversy throughout his long life, and this extended even to his death.[^73] Many of the complaints routinely leveled against Liszt's music today—that it's self-indulgent, incoherent or downright vulgar—seem little more than variations on the criticism he faced from contemporaries.[^74] Critics pointed disapprovingly to the Svengali-like effect Liszt was said to exert over swooning groupies (the "Lisztomania" triggered by his virtuoso persona at the keyboard) or to the contradictions of his lifestyle: "Mephistopheles disguised as an Abbé."[^75]

His symphonic poems were poorly received by critics, especially in Weimar, where they criticised Liszt's compositional style as well as the whole idea of program music as the future of music.[^76] Chopin is reputed to have disliked Liszt's alleged theatricality, highlighting tensions even among fellow composers.[^77]

Liszt became embroiled in what became known as the "War of the Romantics," a term used by some music historians to describe the schism among prominent musicians in the second half of the nineteenth century.[^78] Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention.[^79] The radical progressives mainly from Weimar were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School, and by Richard Wagner.[^80]

Eduard Hanslick rejected the accomplishments of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt while advocating the music of Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms.[^81] Hanslick was a conservative critic and championed absolute music over programmatic music, siding with Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms in the "War of the Romantics," often deriding the works of composers such as Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner.[^82] In his 1854 book, Vom Musikalisch-Schönen, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything specific other than itself.[^83]

Robert Schumann initially maintained a cordial relationship to Franz Liszt, and he publicly praised Liszt's performance skills.[^84] However, once Lisztomania swept through Europe after 1842, Robert and Clara believed that Liszt had become self-deluded, and they became openly hostile towards him.[^85] Notably, Liszt was a lifelong supporter of the works of Robert Schumann.[^86] A particularly tense incident occurred when Liszt arrived two hours late with Wagner to a performance in the Schumanns' home, derided the piece, and spoke ill of the recently deceased Mendelssohn. This upset the Schumanns, and Robert physically assaulted Liszt.[^87]

## Personal Life

Liszt's personal life was dramatic and unconventional for his era. In 1835 he eloped to Switzerland with a married woman, Marie d'Agoult, with whom he lived for four years and had three children.[^88] Franz Liszt and Marie d'Agoult had three children together: Blandine (born in 1835), Cosima (1837), and Daniel (1839), though they did not marry.[^89] Remarkably for those times, he lived openly with women regardless of his patrons' and societies' feelings.[^90]

After Liszt and the Countess separated permanently in 1844, the children did not live with either parent, but rather spent most of their time in the care of Liszt's mother or at boarding schools.[^91] Blandine was born in Geneva on December 18, 1835, and died on September 11, 1862, at the age of twenty-six, having contracted sepsis after surgery on a breast growth which developed shortly after giving birth to a son.[^92] Cosima was born in Como on December 24, 1837, and became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, with whom she founded the Bayreuth Festival.[^93] In 1857, she first married the conductor Hans von Bülow, before her later marriage to Wagner in 1870.[^94] Daniel was born on May 9, 1839, in Rome, and was a promising pianist and gifted scholar when he died of tuberculosis at age twenty on December 13, 1859.[^95]

The 1860s were a period of great sadness in Liszt's private life due to these losses of his son Daniel in 1859 and daughter Blandine in 1862.[^96] In 1847, Liszt met Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, the estranged wife of a German prince who lived in Russia.[^97] By the autumn of 1848 she and Liszt had become lovers, and their relationship lasted for the remainder of his life.[^98] The Roman Catholic Princess and Liszt began living together at Weimar from 1848.[^99]

Eventually, Carolyne wished to regularise their situation and marry Liszt, and after an intricate process that involved moving to Rome and making two direct papal audiences, she temporarily was successful in September 1860.[^100] The couple planned to marry in Rome on October 22, 1861, Liszt's fiftieth birthday.[^101] However, Liszt arrived in Rome the previous day, only to find the princess unable to marry him.[^102] It is possible that both her husband and the tsar of Russia managed to quash permission for the marriage at the Vatican.[^103] A Vatican official arrived to stop their planned marriage in Rome in 1861.[^104] Carolyne subsequently gave up all attempts to marry Liszt, even after her husband's death in 1864.[^105]

Though a ladies' man and fabled lover, he was always attracted to the Church and ultimately took holy orders.[^106] Liszt received the tonsure on April 25, 1865, at the hands of Cardinal Hohenlohe, and on July 31, 1865, he received the four minor orders of porter, lector, exorcist and acolyte.[^107] After this ordination he was often called "Abbé Liszt."[^108] Upon his investiture as abbot in 1865, he took to wearing the habit of the Franciscan order for the rest of his life.[^109] On August 14, 1879, he was made an honorary canon of Albano.[^110]

Liszt became Wagner's father-in-law in 1870 when Wagner married Liszt's daughter Cosima.[^111] Notably, Liszt was not informed in advance of the wedding, and learned of it first through the newspapers.[^112] Wagner was reliant on Liszt, the superstar pianist and composer, for public endorsement and financial support throughout much of his career.[^113] Liszt contributed financially to the building of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1871, and he began to correspond with Wagner and Cosima again, frequently visiting their home Wahnfried.[^114]

In his later years, Liszt divided his time between Rome, Weimar, and Budapest.[^115] Liszt travelled to Bayreuth in the summer of 1886 to support his daughter Cosima, who was running the festival.[^116] He died during the festival, near midnight on July 31, 1886, at the age of seventy-four—officially as a result of pneumonia, which he had contracted prior to arriving in Bayreuth, although the true cause of death may have been a heart attack.[^117] On his way to Bayreuth by night train, Liszt caught pneumonia.[^118] In his final week of life Liszt's health deteriorated further, as he experienced a fever, cough and delirium.[^119] He was buried on August 3, 1886, in the Municipal Cemetery of Bayreuth, according to Cosima's wishes.[^120]

## Legacy

Franz Liszt left behind an extensive and diverse body of work that influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated twentieth-century ideas and trends.[^121] Liszt revolutionized the art of piano playing and established the vogue of the recitalist.[^122] Liszt's immense keyboard skills and flamboyance established new stylistic and technical standards in piano performance, ushering in the era of the modern piano-virtuoso-as-showman, and securing for him a fame unprecedented for his time.[^123]

He influenced virtually every composer of the second half of the nineteenth century and anticipated many of the devices and techniques of the twentieth.[^124] Renowned composers such as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel drew inspiration from his innovative harmonies and imaginative forms.[^125] His symphonic poems were hugely influential, not least on Wagner and, later, on Richard Strauss.[^126]

If one had to choose a single composer whose works sum up the nineteenth century's achievements, innovations, and also weaknesses, Liszt would be the most likely candidate.[^127] The innovations had lasting impact: Liszt made what some critics consider a lasting contribution to the history of musical form since thematic transformation became a regular part of later nineteenth-century music, and "the serial methods of Schönberg, for instance, use precisely the methods of Liszt's thematic transformation within the framework of an entirely different [musical] language."[^128]

The radical change Franz Liszt's compositional style underwent in the last twenty years of his life was unprecedented in Western classical music.[^129] His late compositions, including the stark Via Crucis and experimental pieces like Nuages gris, pointed toward musical modernism with their harmonic innovations and spiritual introspection.[^130] The harmonies of Nuages gris give a very dark and almost morbid feel to the piece, and one of its more intriguing features is its ending, which drifts off into keylessness and progresses to that point in a manner foretelling impressionism in music.[^131] The piece's shockingly progressive harmony anticipates the music of Debussy and composers of the twentieth century.[^132]

It was only in the second half of the twentieth century that the significance of Liszt's late experimental works began to be appreciated.[^133] Liszt wrote Nuages gris and similar late works as a private exercise, and this forward-looking music remained unperformed until the twentieth century.[^134]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Liszt's pupils and their pupils dominated the musical landscape for generations.[^135] He defined the personality of the concert pianist.[^136] In Weimar, Liszt pioneered the concept of the masterclass, which became an influential pedagogical model.[^137] Liszt never taught technique, only interpretation, invented the masterclass, and refused to take money for lessons.[^138] His pupils included Hans von Bülow (later his son-in-law), Carl Tausig and Alexander Siloti—all of whom became influential pianists and teachers in their own right.[^139] Through them, Liszt's methods and musical ideals disseminated across Europe, seeding a lineage of pianistic tradition that endures to this day.[^140]

One could be an up-to-date violinist without knowing anything about Paganini's achievements, but no one could be a first-class pianist without knowing of Liszt's innovations, which influenced even Chopin, and which have helped all pianists and composers for the piano since that time.[^141] Liszt was a composer of enormous originality, extending harmonic language and anticipating the atonal music of the twentieth century.[^142]

Liszt was remarkably generous and philanthropic throughout his career. He made private donations to public services such as hospitals and schools, as well as charitable organisations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund.[^143] More specifically, his beneficiaries included the Hungarian National School of Music, Cologne Cathedral, Leopold Church in Pest, and other smaller donations to charity, hospitals, and schools.[^144] Liszt made so much money during his mid-forties that nearly all his performing fees after 1857 had gone to charity.[^145] In fact, his concert fees were habitually donated to charitable causes, despite his often precarious financial situation.[^146]

After the Great Fire of Hamburg in May 1842, he gave concerts in aid of those left homeless.[^147] Liszt never charged a fee for providing instruction to his students, nor did he accept any remuneration (except living quarters) even from the Hungarian Royal Academy of Music.[^148] In 1824 the twelve-year-old Franz Liszt made his English debut at a fundraising dinner hosted by The Royal Society of Musicians, set up as a 'Fund for Decay'd Musicians.'[^149]

### Negative Views

Despite his achievements, Liszt faced significant criticism throughout his career and beyond. Many of the complaints routinely leveled against Liszt's music today—that it's self-indulgent, incoherent or downright vulgar—originated with his contemporaries.[^150] Eduard Hanslick was an outspoken opponent of the music of Liszt and Wagner, which broke down traditional musical forms as a means of communicating something extra-musical.[^151]

The "War of the Romantics" created a lasting division in musical circles, with Liszt and Wagner on one side and Brahms and the conservative establishment on the other.[^152] Brahms and Clara Schumann detested the music of Liszt, viewing his programmatic and virtuosic approach as antithetical to their ideals of absolute music and classical form.[^153]

Lisztomania, while demonstrating his popularity, also drew criticism for its apparent vulgarity and the way it reduced serious art to spectacle.[^154] The term "mania" had much more of a medical emphasis in the 1840s, suggesting that critics viewed the phenomenon as a kind of mass hysteria or illness.[^155] Some contemporaries viewed Liszt's theatrical performance style as excessive and inappropriate for serious musical discourse.[^156]

Although Liszt's Sonata in B minor was greeted at first with doubt and hostility, it took decades before it became established as a pinnacle of Liszt's repertoire.[^157] His symphonic poems were poorly received by critics initially, and the whole idea of program music as the future of music was contested.[^158] It was only in the twentieth century that many of Liszt's most experimental and forward-looking works received proper appreciation and understanding.[^159]
