## Summary

Tupac Amaru Shakur (born Lesane Parish Crooks, June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), known professionally as 2Pac and later as Makaveli, was an American rapper, actor, poet, and political activist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop artists of all time[^1]. Born to Black Panther activists in New York City, he rose to prominence in the early 1990s with socially conscious rap that addressed issues of racism, police brutality, and inequality[^2]. Having sold over 75 million records worldwide, Shakur's music and cultural impact continues to resonate decades after his death from gunshot wounds sustained in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas[^3]. His work transcended entertainment, establishing him as a symbol of resistance, artistic authenticity, and social consciousness for multiple generations[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan, New York City, with the birth name Lesane Parish Crooks[^5]. When he was one year old, his mother renamed him Tupac Amaru Shakur after Túpac Amaru II, the eighteenth-century indigenous Peruvian revolutionary who led an uprising against Spanish colonizers[^6]. His mother, Afeni Shakur (born Alice Faye Williams), wanted him to carry the name of revolutionary indigenous people, reflecting her own commitment to liberation struggles[^7].

Both of Tupac's parents were active members of the Black Panther Party in New York during the late 1960s and early 1970s[^8]. His mother, Afeni, was one of the "Panther 21" activists charged with conspiring to bomb New York landmarks[^9]. A month before Shakur's birth, Afeni was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial; remarkably, while pregnant with Tupac, she represented herself and won acquittal on all 156 counts[^10]. His biological father, William "Billy" Garland, lost contact with the family when Tupac was five years old, and they did not reunite until Tupac was 23[^11].

Tupac's surname came from Lumumba Shakur, a Sunni Muslim whom his mother married in November 1968, though their marriage fell apart when it was discovered that Lumumba was not Tupac's biological father[^12]. Afeni later married activist Mutulu Shakur in 1975, who became Tupac's stepfather; they divorced in 1982[^13]. Multiple family members were deeply involved in the Black Panther Party's Black Liberation Army and were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned, including Mutulu Shakur, who spent four years as one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives[^14].

Tupac's childhood was marked by instability and hardship. In the 1980s, Afeni struggled to find work and developed a crack cocaine addiction in the early 1980s[^15]. Raising Tupac and his half-sister Sekyiwa alone, she worked as a paralegal before her addiction worsened[^16]. The family had to move frequently, struggling financially and relying on welfare because Afeni couldn't maintain stable employment[^17]. Her drug use deteriorated her relationship with Tupac and his younger sister, who were eventually sent to live in California with a family friend while their mother continued battling her addictions[^18].

In 1984, the family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland[^19]. While living in Baltimore, Shakur attended eighth grade at Roland Park Middle School, then ninth grade at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School[^20]. In 1984, Shakur enrolled at the prestigious Baltimore School for the Arts for tenth grade, where he said he felt "the freest I ever felt"[^21]. There he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet, distinguishing himself as a student both creatively and academically[^22]. He performed in Shakespeare plays—identifying patterns between their themes and gang warfare—and portrayed the Mouse King in The Nutcracker ballet[^23]. It was at Baltimore School for the Arts that Tupac met Jada Pinkett, and their connection was instant, with the teens becoming fast friends and "pretty much inseparable from the day that we met"[^24]. However, his family relocated to Marin City, California, in 1988 before he could graduate[^25].

## Rise to Power

Tupac's entry into the music industry began in 1990 when he was signed by Atron Gregory, manager of the Oakland-based hip-hop group Digital Underground[^26]. Gregory initially placed him with the group as a roadie and backup dancer, with responsibilities that included menial tasks like carrying bags for artists, though Gregory understood Tupac was also an artist and didn't want to humiliate him[^27].

Shakur made his professional debut under the stage name 2Pac on Digital Underground's January 1991 single "Same Song" under Interscope Records[^28]. The song was featured on the soundtrack of the 1991 film Nothing but Trouble, starring Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Chevy Chase, and Demi Moore[^29]. Shakur also appeared with Digital Underground in the film, marking his first film appearance[^30]. He portrayed an African king in the "Same Song" music video, which opened the group's January 1991 EP titled This Is an EP Release[^31].

In November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, 2Pacalypse Now, whose title alluded to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now[^32]. Compared to Digital Underground's playful works, the album explored contemporary social issues in American society, including racism, police brutality, poverty, gang violence, teenage pregnancy, and drug abuse[^33]. The album cemented him as a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his political rap lyrics[^34]. However, it generated significant controversy when Ronald Ray Howard murdered a Texas Highway Patrol trooper and his defense attorney claimed he was influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its strong theme of police brutality[^35]. U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle publicly criticized the album, stating, "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society"[^36].

Despite the controversy—or perhaps because of it—Tupac's profile continued to rise. He achieved further critical and commercial success with his second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993)[^37]. Simultaneously, Tupac pursued acting with remarkable success. He commanded the screen with an effectiveness that no rapper-turned-actor had managed before[^38]. In 1992, just a year after releasing his debut album, Shakur reached what many consider his peak as an actor with Juice, where he starred as Bishop, a Harlem teen whose thirst for respect rapidly descends into violence[^39]. He earned critical acclaim for this villainous role[^40]. In 1993, he starred alongside Janet Jackson in John Singleton's romance film Poetic Justice, playing a mail carrier named Lucky[^41]. That same year, Jada Pinkett Smith secured him a guest starring role on the sitcom A Different World[^42].

In 1994, Tupac formed the group Thug Life with his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, Stretch, Big Syke, The Rated R, and Macadoshis[^43]. They released the album Thug Life, Volume I on September 26, 1994, through Interscope Records[^44]. With many songs deemed too controversial to release, the album featured only ten tracks, with two being solo songs by 2Pac[^45]. The album debuted at number 42 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA[^46]. The group disbanded in 1995 after releasing just this one album[^47].

## Major Achievements

Tupac Shakur's third studio album, Me Against the World, released on March 14, 1995, marked a watershed moment in his career[^48]. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, holding the top spot for four consecutive weeks—2Pac's longest-running No. 1 on the Billboard 200[^49]. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week[^50]. Remarkably, 2Pac became the first prison inmate with a number one album, as he was behind bars serving a sentence for sexual abuse when the album debuted[^51]. While incarcerated, the album overtook Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits as the best-selling album of the year in the United States[^52]. The album was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA and featured the hit single "Dear Mama," which was later added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry in 2010[^53].

In October 1995, while Tupac was imprisoned on sexual assault charges, Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row Records, visited him in prison and posted $1.4 million bond[^54]. Shakur returned to Los Angeles and joined Death Row Records, with the appeal of his conviction pending[^55]. This partnership would prove extraordinarily productive, if tragically brief.

In 1996, Death Row released Shakur's greatest commercial success, All Eyez on Me[^56]. Released on February 13, 1996, seven months before his death, All Eyez on Me was the first double album in hip-hop history[^57]. The album abandoned the introspective lyrics of Me Against the World for volatile gangsta rap[^58]. It achieved Diamond certification—having sold over 10 million copies—and was certified five-times platinum in the US after just two months of release[^59]. The album yielded two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: "California Love" (featuring Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman) and "How Do U Want It"[^60].

Throughout his career, Tupac demonstrated versatility across multiple artistic mediums. As an actor, he starred in seven feature films and two television episodes prior to his death[^61]. His major film roles included Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997)[^62]. While he wasn't considered Oscar material, he typically delivered quality performances, and many fans believe he would have branched out into even bigger roles had he lived longer[^63].

Tupac also distinguished himself as a poet. Between 1989 and 1991, he wrote seventy-two poems that were published posthumously in 1999 as The Rose That Grew from Concrete[^64]. The collection, published by Pocket Books through its MTV Books imprint, featured a preface by Afeni Shakur, a foreword by poet Nikki Giovanni, and an introduction by his manager Leila Steinberg[^65]. Each poem was presented with both the original handwritten format alongside the typeset version, allowing readers to see Tupac's actual handwriting and creative process[^66]. The poetry explored themes of love, loss, ambition, and social justice with a vulnerability that contrasted with the bravado often associated with his rap persona[^67].

At the core of Tupac's influence was his revolutionary approach to lyrical content. He was renowned for crafting songs with deep narrative threads, balancing complexity with relatability[^68]. His lyrics frequently tackled racial and social issues, serving as a mirror reflecting the struggles and triumphs of the African American community[^69]. Whereas other rappers in the mid-1990s were flashy and witty wordsmith MCs, Tupac was fundamentally a poet and social commentator[^70]. He incorporated political and social issues into his music and integrated genres like soul, funk, and jazz into his songs[^71].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Tupac Shakur's career was plagued by legal troubles and violent confrontations that significantly tarnished his public image and interrupted his artistic output. In October 1991, Shakur filed a $10 million civil suit against the Oakland Police Department, alleging that police brutally beat him for jaywalking; he received approximately $43,000 in settlement[^72]. On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed at an outdoor festival where a confrontation occurred involving his legally registered gun; about 100 yards away, a six-year-old boy was struck by a bullet in the forehead and killed[^73]. Although police matched the bullet to a pistol registered to Shakur, no charges were filed[^74].

He was cleared of charges arising from a 1993 gunfight with two off-duty Atlanta, Georgia, police officers[^75]. However, he was convicted in 1994 of attacking a man with a baseball bat at a 1993 Michigan State University concert[^76]. Most seriously, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges related to a 1993 incident, though he maintained his innocence[^77]. He was released pending appeal in 1995 when Suge Knight posted his $1.4 million bond[^78].

The most pivotal violent incident occurred on November 30, 1994, when Tupac was shot five times in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Times Square, New York[^79]. The event took place after Biggie's associate Lil Cease had called Tupac to the studio, and Biggie was reportedly in the studio with Sean Combs (then known as Puff Daddy)[^80]. This led Tupac to believe that Biggie's camp was behind the shooting, marking the beginning of one of the biggest beefs in hip-hop history[^81]. While Tupac was in jail, Biggie released the track "Who Shot Ya," which Tupac believed was aimed at him[^82]. Shortly after his release, he responded with "Hit 'Em Up," which took shots at Biggie, Combs, Mobb Deep, and Lil' Kim[^83].

This personal feud became inseparable from the larger East Coast-West Coast hip-hop rivalry, a dispute between artists and fans of the East Coast and West Coast hip-hop scenes that dominated the mid-1990s[^84]. A focal point of the rivalry was the feud between East Coast-based rapper the Notorious B.I.G. (Biggie), signed by Puff Daddy to their New York City-based label Bad Boy Records, and West Coast-based rapper Tupac Shakur, signed by Suge Knight to their Los Angeles-based label Death Row Records[^85]. What made this especially tragic was that Biggie and Tupac had started off as friends[^86].

Knight's feud with East Coast record executive Sean Combs intensified when Knight insulted the Bad Boy label founder on air at the Source Awards in August 1995[^87]. The rivalry created an increasingly toxic and dangerous environment in hip-hop culture. Tupac was gunned down on September 7, 1996, and died six days later, while Biggie was shot and killed six months later on March 9, 1997[^88]. Neither murder was initially solved, though significant developments occurred decades later[^89].

Critics of Tupac's music claimed that his lyrics encouraged violence. Beyond the Vice President's condemnation, cases emerged where young people cited Tupac's music as inspiration for violent acts, including the Texas state trooper shooting[^90]. This criticism intensified debates about artistic expression versus social responsibility in hip-hop culture.

In his personal life, Tupac's relationships were complex and sometimes controversial. He briefly dated pop star Madonna; however, while serving time in prison in January 1995, Tupac wrote a letter to Madonna ending their relationship because of her race[^91]. He married Keisha Morris in April 1995 while still in prison; the couple had met several months earlier at a nightclub when Morris was 20 and Tupac was 21[^92]. Their marriage was annulled ten months later after Tupac was released from jail[^93].

## Personal Life

Tupac Shakur's personal life was profoundly shaped by his revolutionary family heritage. His mother, Afeni Shakur (born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina), was a prominent Black Panther Party member and one of the "Panther 21" activists[^94]. While pregnant with Tupac, she represented herself in the Panther 21 trial and won acquittal on all 156 counts—a remarkable achievement that speaks to her intelligence and determination[^95]. Afeni's teachings and values deeply impacted Tupac's lyrical content, leading him to address issues of racism, poverty, police brutality, and inequality in his music[^96].

Tupac had multiple half-siblings from both parents. His half-sister Sekyiwa was the child of Afeni and Mutulu Shakur, born in 1975[^97]. He also had three half-brothers—Billy Jr., Malik, and Landon—all born to his biological father Billy Garland[^98]. Additionally, he had half-sisters including Takerra Allen and N'Neka Garland from his father's side, and a stepbrother named Mopreme, who would later join him in the group Thug Life[^99].

The Shakur family's connection to political activism ran deep. Multiple family members were involved in the Black Liberation Movement, which profoundly influenced Tupac's worldview and music[^100]. This revolutionary upbringing meant that Tupac was steeped in the language of liberation, solidarity, and socialist struggle as part of a living, breathing movement[^101]. Even at a young age, Shakur's writing dealt with themes such as Black liberation, mass incarceration, race, and masculinity[^102]. His poems were written for Jamal Joseph and three other Black Panther Party members while they were incarcerated[^103].

One of the most significant relationships in Tupac's life was his friendship with actress Jada Pinkett Smith. They first met in the 1980s as sophomores at the Baltimore School for the Arts in Maryland[^104]. Pinkett Smith described their bond: "We were pretty much inseparable from the day that we met"[^105]. In a 2014 interview with Arsenio Hall, Pinkett Smith recalled: "Pac was probably one of the first male figures that I had in my life that saw the beauty and the talent and my intelligence separated from sex"[^106]. According to Pinkett Smith, at the time of their meeting, she was selling drugs and "coming out of the life," while he was "going more into the life"[^107]. Though their friendship had its share of ups and downs, both professed a deep love for one another that lasted until Shakur's death in 1996[^108]. Pinkett Smith has called Tupac her "soulmate," though she clarified the relationship was never romantic[^109].

Tupac was a prolific reader who enjoyed studying history and philosophy, often incorporating these themes into his music[^110]. He was more than just a rapper—he was a revolutionary voice whose lyrics addressed the struggles, joys, and complexities of being Black in America, with words that transcended music to capture the essence of love, resistance, and resilience[^111].

## Legacy

More than two decades after his death on September 13, 1996, Tupac Shakur endures as one of hip-hop's most iconic figures[^112]. He is considered one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time, with some noting that "Tupac Shakur is the most influential hip-hop artist of all time"[^113]. Throughout his career, he released a total of eleven albums, including posthumous releases, which have sold over 75 million copies worldwide[^114]. He is the second best-selling hip-hop artist in U.S. history according to the RIAA, with 37.5 million albums sold in the country[^115].

Shakur's double-length posthumous album Greatest Hits (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only nine hip-hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States[^116]. Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, including the acclaimed The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996) under the stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified multi-platinum in the United States[^117].

Tupac's influence on modern artists is profound and far-reaching. Artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Drake have openly cited Pac as a major influence, not just musically but philosophically[^118]. Pac's raw, introspective storytelling set a standard for vulnerability, honesty, and social awareness in rap[^119]. His impact extends far beyond music—he became a symbol of resistance, social consciousness, and artistic authenticity that continues to resonate across generations and cultures worldwide[^120].

Academic research has explored the global reach of his cultural impact, including studies on the convergence of mass media and social discontent by focusing on Tupac Shakur's popularity in Sierra Leone, where militant factions used Tupac T-shirts as fatigues and incorporated his discourse into their worldviews[^121]. His influence in music, activism, songwriting, and other areas of culture has been the subject of extensive academic studies[^122]. In 2012, the Norwegian University of Oslo organized a course on Tupac, hip-hop, and cultural history[^123].

Tupac's fashion had a significant influence on popular culture in the 1990s, especially in urban fashion, with his style becoming a reference point for young people[^124]. Music scholar Emmett Price called him a "Black folk hero" and identified in Shakur's work a quest to "unify mind, body, and spirit"[^125]. According to music journalist Chuck Philips, Shakur "had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form"[^126].

In 2017, Shakur was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility[^127]. In 2023, he was awarded a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame[^128]. Tupac earned seven Grammy Award nominations across categories such as Best Rap Album, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, Best Rap Solo Performance, and Best Music Film for works including All Eyez on Me (1996), "Changes" (1998), and Dear Mama (2023), though he did not secure a win during his lifetime[^129]. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame[^130].

Billboard ranked Shakur at number 4 of the top 50 rappers in 2023[^131]. Rolling Stone magazine placed Tupac at No. 86 among the "100 Greatest Artists" in 2010[^132]. He was ranked #1 on MTV's list of 22 Greatest MCs as voted by viewers[^133].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and cultural critics have extensively documented Tupac Shakur's contributions to American culture and the Black freedom struggle. The Journal of Black Studies published a political perspective on Tupac Shakur in 2011, with researchers noting that while popular and academic writers have examined his work, many have failed to fully explore his distinct political ideas and identifiable activism[^134]. Despite this gap, outside of his critics, Tupac is generally perceived as a socially conscious artist[^135].

Academic research has approached Tupac through various theoretical lenses. One thesis argues for Tupac Shakur as an intellectual and leader of resistance against oppression through his defiant works of music[^136]. Scholars agree that hip-hop provides Black people a platform to communicate their circumstances, and hip-hop music is a tool to express rage toward urban oppressions and demand change[^137]. Research has used his lyrics as qualitative data to serve as a cultural map to constructs of identity, race, social class, and Black masculinity, applying critical race theory[^138].

Music scholar Emmett Price called him a "Black folk hero" and identified in Shakur's work a quest to "unify mind, body, and spirit"[^139]. According to music journalist Chuck Philips, Shakur "had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form"[^140]. His revolutionary approach to lyrical content, balancing complexity with relatability while addressing racial and social issues, established him as fundamentally different from his contemporaries[^141].

Defenders of Tupac's work emphasize his commitment to social justice activism. In 1995, he revealed plans to unite youths, saying he planned to get young people together and encourage them to respect their communities[^142]. He created a plan to mitigate violence in Black communities with a code of ethics for drug dealers and truces between gangs[^143]. His first LP, 2Pacalypse Now (1991), directly confronted issues like mass incarceration, violence, illegal drugs, police brutality, and racism[^144].

Tupac's artistic output in poetry further demonstrates his intellectual depth. The Rose That Grew from Concrete reveals an intimate side of Tupac, exploring themes of love, loss, ambition, and social justice with vulnerability that contrasts with the bravado often associated with his rap persona[^145]. The collection demonstrates that Tupac was a multifaceted artist whose contributions extended beyond commercial rap music to include serious literary expression.

### Negative Views

Critics of Tupac Shakur have raised serious concerns about the messages in his music and the contradictions between his stated ideals and his actions. The most prominent criticism came from the highest levels of government when U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle condemned his debut album, stating, "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society"[^146]. This criticism intensified when Ronald Ray Howard murdered a Texas Highway Patrol trooper in 1992, and his defense attorney claimed he was influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its strong theme of police brutality[^147].

Critics claimed that his lyrics encouraged violence, pointing to cases where young people cited Tupac's music as inspiration for violent acts, including the gunning down of a Texas state trooper[^148]. These incidents raised fundamental questions about artistic responsibility and the potential real-world consequences of violent imagery and rhetoric in popular music.

Academic critics have also noted contradictions in Tupac's persona and message. Research on "Tupac Shakur: Understanding the Identity Formation of Hyper-Masculinity of a Popular Hip-Hop Artist" examines how his construction of Black masculinity may have reinforced problematic stereotypes[^149]. Some scholars argue that while his early work showed promise as social commentary, his later work with Death Row Records—particularly All Eyez on Me—"abandoned introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap," representing a troubling shift away from conscious hip-hop toward commercialized violence[^150].

His legal troubles significantly undermined his credibility as a social justice advocate. His conviction for sexual abuse, the violent altercations with police officers, and the assault with a baseball bat demonstrated a pattern of behavior that contradicted his stated commitment to uplifting Black communities[^151]. The East Coast-West Coast rivalry, which Tupac inflamed with tracks like "Hit 'Em Up," contributed to a toxic environment in hip-hop culture that many believe led to both his death and the death of the Notorious B.I.G.[^152]

Some critics view Tupac's relationship with Death Row Records and Suge Knight as a Faustian bargain that compromised his artistic integrity. While Knight's $1.4 million bail payment freed Tupac from prison, it also bound him to a label and CEO associated with violence and intimidation[^153]. Critics argue that Tupac's final year represented not artistic growth but rather a descent into the very culture of violence and materialism that his early work had critiqued.

The unsolved nature of his murder and the conspiracy theories surrounding it have also complicated his legacy. One year after the shooting, the lead investigator told the Las Vegas Sun that Shakur's murder "may never be solved"[^154]. A Los Angeles Times investigation published in 2002 determined that uncooperative witnesses and minimal pursuit of gang-related leads resulted in an unresolved homicide case[^155]. This lack of cooperation from witnesses, potentially including those in Tupac's own circle, suggests a code of silence that perpetuated the very cycle of violence he claimed to oppose.
