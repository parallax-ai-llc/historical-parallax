## Summary
Lonnie David Franklin Jr., the 'Grim Sleeper,' was an American serial killer who murdered at least 10 women in Los Angeles between 1985 and 2007. His case was notable for a 14-year gap between known killings. He was identified through familial DNA searching and convicted in 2016.

## Early Life
Born August 30, 1952, in Los Angeles. He was a former sanitation worker and mechanic. He had a previous conviction for assault. He lived in South Los Angeles. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1985 and 2007, Franklin murdered at least 10 women in South Los Angeles, primarily sex workers and drug users. He shot and sometimes strangled victims. There was a notable 14-year gap (1988-2002) in known killings, earning him the 'Grim Sleeper' moniker. Police later found photos of over 180 women in his home. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Franklin was identified in 2010 through familial DNA searching — his son's DNA in a criminal database was partially matched to crime scene evidence. Undercover officers collected Franklin's DNA from discarded pizza. He was arrested July 7, 2010, convicted of 10 murders in 2016, and sentenced to death. He died in prison on March 28, 2020. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His identification through familial DNA searching was a landmark in forensic technology [^4]
- His case exposed LAPD's inadequate response to serial crimes in minority communities
- Led to reforms in how LAPD prioritized serial crime investigations

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered at least 10 women over 22 years [^5]
- Targeted vulnerable African-American women in South LA
- Police were slow to investigate due to victims' marginalized status
- Photographs found suggested many more potential victims
- His case epitomized systemic racism in police priorities
