## Summary

Prayut Chan-o-cha is a Thai former military officer and politician who served as the 29th Prime Minister of Thailand from 2014 to 2023, after seizing power in a military coup d'état.[^1] Born on March 21, 1954, in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, he rose through the ranks of the Royal Thai Army to become Commander-in-Chief from 2010 to 2014.[^2] His tenure as prime minister was marked by authoritarian governance, suppression of democratic freedoms, and controversial infrastructure projects, making him one of Thailand's most divisive modern leaders.[^3] After nearly nine years in power, he retired from politics in July 2023 following a decisive electoral defeat that demonstrated widespread public rejection of military-backed rule.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Prayut Chan-o-cha was born on March 21, 1954, in Nakhon Ratchasima Province in northeastern Thailand, into a military family that would shape his future career trajectory.[^5] His father, Colonel Prapat Chan-o-cha, served as a career officer in the Royal Thai Army, providing young Prayut with early exposure to military culture and discipline.[^6] His mother, Khemphet Chan-o-cha, originally from Chaiyaphum Province, worked as a schoolteacher, bringing an educational perspective to the household that balanced the military influence.[^7]

Growing up in a military environment during the Cold War era, Prayut developed an early affinity for the armed forces and the hierarchical structures that defined Thai military life. The political instability that characterized Thailand during his youth—marked by multiple coups and military interventions—normalized the concept of military involvement in politics for his generation.[^8] This formative period coincided with Thailand's participation in the Vietnam War as a US ally, which brought increased American military aid and strengthened the Thai military's institutional power.[^9]

In 1971, at the age of 17, Prayut spent his senior high school year at the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School (AFAPS) Class 12, a prestigious institution that prepared young men for military careers.[^10] This experience solidified his commitment to military service and connected him with peers who would later become influential figures in Thailand's military establishment. Five years later, in 1976, Prayut entered the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy as part of Class 23, where he would undergo rigorous training that molded him into a professional army officer.[^11] He graduated with a bachelor of science degree, having completed the Infantry Officer Basic Course Class 51 in his first year and the Infantry Officer Advanced Course Class 34 in 1981.[^12]

Prayut's educational journey continued throughout his military career, reflecting the Thai army's emphasis on continuous professional development. Before fully launching into active service, he graduated from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC) Class 63 in 1985, an institution that prepares mid-level officers for higher command positions.[^13] Much later in his career, in 2007, he attended a management course at the National Defence College of Thailand (NDC) Class 20, which focuses on strategic thinking and national security issues at the highest levels.[^14] This extensive military education equipped Prayut with both tactical skills and strategic thinking capabilities that would later define his approach to governance.

## Rise to Power

Prayut Chan-o-cha's ascent to Thailand's highest office was neither conventional nor democratic, but rather the culmination of decades spent navigating the complex networks of Thailand's military establishment. Like many military leaders from his generation, Prayut began his career in the 2nd Infantry Division, headquartered in eastern Thailand, particularly in the 21st Infantry Regiment, known as the Queen's Guards.[^15] This placement was significant because it connected him to what would become known as the army's "Eastern Tigers" faction, a powerful network of officers who would dominate Thai military politics for decades.[^16]

The Eastern Tigers faction, to which Prayut belonged alongside his direct predecessor Anupong Paochinda and former defense minister Prawit Wongsuwan, represented a cohesive group within the military that prioritized loyalty, hierarchy, and conservative royalist values.[^17] This network proved instrumental in Prayut's steady rise through the ranks. By the time of the 2006 military coup that overthrew Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Prayut had attained the rank of major general, positioning him among the senior leadership of the army.[^18] Following the coup, he was appointed to the military-established National Legislative Assembly, giving him his first direct taste of political governance.[^19]

Between 2008 and 2009, Prayut served as Chief of Staff of the Royal Thai Army, a critical position that placed him at the center of military decision-making during a period of intense political turmoil.[^20] In 2009, he was appointed honorary adjutant to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a prestigious position that signaled royal approval and strengthened his legitimacy within Thailand's hierarchical power structure.[^21] Then came the pivotal year of 2010, when Prayut succeeded Anupong Paochinda as Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, ascending to the military's top position.[^22]

Almost immediately after taking command, Prayut faced his first major test of authority. From October 5 to December 21, 2010, he led the Centre for the Resolution of Emergency Situations (CRES), tasked with maintaining order following the violent crackdown on Red Shirt protesters earlier that year.[^23] During the April and May 2010 protests, army forces under the command of senior officers including Prayut had opened fire on pro-Thaksin demonstrators in downtown Bangkok, resulting in more than 90 deaths.[^24] Prayut's denial of any army abuses and his use of authoritarian methods to control the political situation during this period foreshadowed the approach he would later take as prime minister.[^25]

As army chief from 2010 to 2014, Prayut positioned himself as a guardian of Thailand's traditional power structures against what he and his allies perceived as the threat posed by Thaksin Shinawatra's populist political movement. When anti-government protests led by former Democrat Party secretary general Suthep Thaugsuban erupted in November 2013, Thailand descended into months of political chaos.[^26] The demonstrations, which claimed at least 28 lives and left more than 700 injured, created an atmosphere of crisis that Prayut and his military colleagues argued could only be resolved through direct intervention.[^27]

On May 22, 2014, Prayut led a military coup d'état against the caretaker government, marking Thailand's 12th putsch since it became a constitutional monarchy in 1932.[^28] The coup installed the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), a military junta with Prayut as its leader, which would govern Thailand from May 22, 2014, to July 10, 2019.[^29] Just three months later, in August 2014, an unelected military-dominated national legislature appointed Prayut as Prime Minister of Thailand, a position that was formally endorsed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej on August 25.[^30] What began as a military intervention was now being transformed into a longer-term political project, with Prayut transitioning from coup leader to civilian prime minister while maintaining his military backing and authoritarian approach to governance.

## Major Achievements

During his nearly nine-year tenure as prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha launched several ambitious economic and development initiatives aimed at transforming Thailand into a more advanced, innovation-driven economy. His flagship policy was the Thailand 4.0 initiative, an economic model designed to move Thailand from a middle-income economy to a high-income economy through value-based and innovation-driven development.[^31] This vision sought to shift Thailand away from its traditional dependence on agriculture and low-skilled manufacturing toward advanced industries, robotics, aviation, biotechnology, and digital technology.[^32]

Central to the Thailand 4.0 vision was the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), Prayut's most ambitious infrastructure project. Officially launched in 2018 after passage of the Eastern Economic Corridor Act, the EEC aimed to develop three eastern provinces—Chonburi, Rayong, and Chachoengsao—into a hub for advanced industries, attracting foreign investment in sectors such as medical care, renewable energy, and high-tech manufacturing.[^33] The project included construction of a high-speed railway connecting three major airports, expansion of Laem Chabang Port to increase its container handling capacity, and development of U-Tapao Airport into a major international aviation hub.[^34]

Prayut's government also promoted the Bio-Circular-Green Economy Model (BCG), positioning Thailand as a leader in sustainable development within Southeast Asia. This model aimed to pursue balanced and inclusive economic and social growth based on the 20-Year National Strategy, guided by the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.[^35] The BCG approach emphasized utilizing Thailand's biodiversity and agricultural resources in environmentally sustainable ways, promoting circular economy principles, and transitioning toward green energy and reduced carbon emissions.[^36]

In grassroots economic development, Prayut introduced the Pracharath model, a partnership formed between the state, private sector, and public aimed at strengthening Thailand's economy at the local level.[^37] This initiative sought to create a new development paradigm that distinguished itself from the populist policies of the Thaksin era, focusing instead on community-level economic cooperation and self-sufficiency. The model involved collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and local communities to develop small and medium enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and tourism ventures in rural areas.[^38]

Recognizing the potential of Thailand's cultural assets, Prayut's government initiated policies to develop the creative economy and cultural soft power. This strategy focused on Thailand's cultural resources through what became known as the "5 Fs": food, film, fashion, fighting (Thai martial arts), and Thai traditional festivals.[^39] The government provided support for Thailand's creative industries, promoted Thai cuisine internationally, supported film production in Thailand, and marketed Thai cultural products to enhance the country's global cultural influence and generate economic value from intangible heritage.[^40]

In regional connectivity and trade, Prayut pursued several major infrastructure projects including the Thai Bridge Project (Saphan Thai) and connectivity between Laem Chabang Seaport and international logistic hubs through the Gulf of Thailand–Andaman Sea Linkage Development.[^41] The Southern Land Bridge project, initiated in 2021, envisioned deep-sea ports at Laem Riw cape in Chumphon and Laem Ao Ang cape in Ranong, connected by motorway and dual-track railway at a combined cost exceeding 850 billion baht.[^42]

Prayut also championed the Bangkok–Nong Khai high-speed rail project, which originated from Thai-Chinese government cooperation and gained momentum following bilateral talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in late 2014.[^43] This project represented Thailand's first foray into high-speed rail technology and symbolized the closer economic ties with China that developed during Prayut's tenure. According to the transportation infrastructure development plan under his government, Thailand was expected to spend at least 1.8 trillion baht on megaprojects during 2015-2022, representing one of the most ambitious infrastructure investment programs in Thai history.[^44]

On the international stage, Prayut worked to maintain Thailand's central position in ASEAN and regional economic cooperation. He actively participated in ASEAN summits, the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS), and APEC forums, positioning Thailand as a bridge between major powers and promoting regional economic integration.[^45] His government also emphasized the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy in international forums, including at the United Nations, promoting it as Thailand's unique contribution to sustainable development thinking.[^46]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Prayut Chan-o-cha's tenure as prime minister was defined by systematic suppression of democratic freedoms and widespread human rights abuses that drew international condemnation. After seizing power in the 2014 coup, his government implemented an immediate and far-reaching crackdown on dissent, arresting politicians, activists, academics, and ordinary citizens who criticized military rule.[^47] The NCPO partially repealed the 2007 constitution, declared martial law and a nationwide curfew, banned all political gatherings, arrested and detained opposition figures, imposed extensive Internet censorship, and took direct control of media outlets.[^48]

The five years of pure military junta rule from 2014 to 2019 were characterized by relentless repression of anyone viewed as a political threat, whether opposition politicians seeking a return to democracy or online critics of military governance.[^49] The regime sought to intimidate and silence opposition through harassing criminal charges, abusive prosecutions, arbitrary closure of television, radio, and internet stations, and pervasive censorship of online content.[^50] Human Rights Watch documented that from the very first months of Prayut's rule, he imposed a regime of terror on critics, with more than 20 journalists and bloggers fleeing abroad to avoid imprisonment before his first year as prime minister concluded.[^51]

One of the most controversial aspects of Prayut's governance was his aggressive enforcement of Thailand's lèse-majesté law, which criminalizes criticism of the monarchy. After taking power, Prayut made lèse-majesté prosecutions a top priority for his administration, using the law as a political weapon against opponents.[^52] As of March 2023, at least 238 people, including a 15-year-old girl, had been charged with violating the lèse-majesté statute, with many receiving harsh prison sentences for social media posts or peaceful political expression.[^53] The law, which carries sentences of up to 15 years per count, was weaponized to silence critics who had no intention of insulting the monarchy but were simply expressing political opinions.[^54]

Prayut's personal statements often revealed his contempt for democratic values and human rights. In April 2015, he publicly questioned why people asked for democracy and human rights, shocking observers both domestically and internationally.[^55] At the end of 2015, he warned academics who criticized him and flatly denied that his government had committed human rights abuses against its critics, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.[^56] His confrontational relationship with media became legendary, with Prayut sometimes berating journalists at press conferences, walking out of interviews, and even bringing a life-sized cardboard cutout of himself to a press conference, telling reporters to "ask it questions" instead.[^57]

The 2016 constitutional referendum process exemplified Prayut's manipulation of democratic procedures to entrench military power. The NCPO banned all criticism of the draft constitution and prohibited independent monitoring of the referendum.[^58] Activists opposing the document were arrested, detained, and prosecuted in military courts, while voters who publicly expressed intentions to vote against the draft were similarly arrested and prosecuted.[^59] Despite these authoritarian conditions, the junta claimed the constitution was approved by 61% of voters, though the legitimacy of the process was widely questioned.[^60]

The 2017 constitution itself was designed to perpetuate military influence over Thai politics even after elections were held. The charter established a fully appointed Senate of 250 members—all selected by the military junta—and gave this unelected body the power to join with the elected House of Representatives in choosing the prime minister.[^61] This arrangement virtually guaranteed Prayut could remain prime minister even if pro-military parties won fewer seats in the lower house, as indeed occurred in the 2019 election.[^62]

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prayut used the health crisis as a pretext to expand authoritarian controls. His government imposed a state of emergency on March 26, 2020, which was extended fifteen times, raising serious concerns about the indefinite suspension of normal democratic processes.[^63] The government was widely criticized for being non-communicative, slow, and ineffective in its pandemic response, with only 0.4 percent of the population vaccinated by early 2021, far too slow for a country attempting to reopen its borders.[^64] Meanwhile, the emergency powers were used to arrest democracy activists and suppress the massive youth-led protests that erupted in 2020 demanding democratic reforms and greater accountability from the monarchy.[^65]

The lack of accountability for the 2010 Red Shirt massacre continued to haunt Prayut's tenure. Despite evidence that army forces under the command of senior officers including Prayut had killed more than 90 civilians during the crackdown, no soldiers were ever convicted of wrongdoing.[^66] Prayut consistently denied that soldiers killed anyone during the conflicts, contradicting eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence.[^67] This impunity demonstrated the military's ability to escape justice for human rights abuses, reinforcing a culture of lawlessness among security forces.[^68]

International criticism of Prayut's authoritarian rule was widespread. Prayut's invitation by President Barack Obama to a 2016 summit meeting was criticized by human rights activists, opposition leaders, and scholars who warned that such recognition would suggest Washington's endorsement of the military dictatorship.[^69] Reporters Without Borders designated Prayut as a "predator of press freedom," documenting systematic media suppression under his rule.[^70] Thailand's democracy rankings plummeted during his tenure, with Freedom House downgrading the country's status and noting the severe deterioration of civil and political rights.[^71]

## Personal Life

Prayut Chan-o-cha married Naraporn Chan-o-cha (née Rotchanachan) on June 22, 1984, after meeting her while she was teaching English at Chulalongkorn University, one of Thailand's most prestigious institutions.[^72] Naraporn is a former associate professor at Chulalongkorn University's Language Institute, bringing an academic and educational background that contrasted with her husband's military career.[^73] Despite her professional credentials, she largely embraced traditional roles expected of high-ranking military wives in Thai society, serving as president of the Army Wives' Association since Prayut's appointment as army chief in 2010.[^74]

Naraporn remained active in educational causes throughout her husband's time in power, maintaining involvement with distance learning organizations and teaching English on a long-distance learning television channel.[^75] Her public profile remained relatively modest compared to some previous prime ministers' spouses, reflecting both personal preference and the military junta's general approach to limiting public scrutiny of leaders' families. The Army Wives' Association under her leadership engaged in charitable activities and social welfare programs, following established patterns for organizations led by the spouses of senior military officers.[^76]

The couple has twin daughters named Tanya and Nittha, who were in their twenties during Prayut's prime ministership.[^77] Several years before their father's rise to political prominence, the twins enjoyed success as a "punk-lite rock duo," performing in Bangkok's music scene and attracting a following among young Thais.[^78] Their musical careers represented a stark contrast to their father's authoritarian image and conservative values, though they largely withdrew from public life after the 2014 coup.[^79]

The family's decision to maintain a low profile became even more pronounced after a Red Shirt leader publicly called for Prayut's daughters to be kidnapped if he were to stage a coup, a threat made before the 2014 takeover that materialized into frightening reality once Prayut seized power.[^80] This threat underscored the intense political polarization in Thai society and the personal security risks faced by the families of high-profile political figures. Subsequently, information about his daughters' activities, whereabouts, and daily lives became closely guarded, with media outlets exercising self-censorship about the prime minister's family.[^81]

Despite his authoritarian public persona, those who know Prayut personally have described him as capable of warmth within his inner circle, though also possessing a volatile temper. In August 2012, before becoming prime minister, Prayut himself acknowledged this aspect of his personality, stating: "It's normal for me to get angry; otherwise I wouldn't be able to rule over the army."[^82] This quote revealed his belief that intimidation and displays of anger were necessary leadership tools, an approach he would carry into civilian governance with often disastrous results for Thailand's democratic culture.[^83]

Prayut's management style was characterized by micromanagement, sudden policy announcements made without consultation with relevant ministries, and emotional reactions to criticism. He developed a reputation for lengthy, rambling speeches on his weekly television programs, sometimes speaking for over an hour on topics ranging from national policy to personal grievances.[^84] His confrontational interactions with journalists became legendary, including incidents where he threw a banana peel at a reporter and walked out of press conferences when asked uncomfortable questions.[^85]

## Legacy

Prayut Chan-o-cha's nine-year rule left Thailand with what observers widely characterize as a deeply damaged democracy and weakened institutions. When he announced his retirement from politics in July 2023, most analysts agreed that his long tenure would be remembered mainly for the negatives: leaving democracy in tatters, cracking down on dissent, and ramping up arrests for alleged royal defamation.[^86] His era as a military coup leader turned prime minister was indelibly marred by growing authoritarianism and widening inequality, with Thailand seeing signs of economic stagnation, political decay, and its lowest international standing in modern history.[^87]

The May 2023 general election delivered a decisive verdict on Prayut's legacy. Thai opposition parties swept the board as voters delivered a powerful rebuke of the military-backed establishment that had ruled since the coup.[^88] Prayut's United Thai Nation Party won only 36 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, a humiliating result that clearly showed a majority of Thai voters were fed up with the general and his clique.[^89] Termsak Chalermpalanupap of the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute bluntly assessed Prayut as "a failed leader," noting that the election outcome reflected widespread public dissatisfaction with his governance.[^90]

Perhaps most significantly, Prayut's legacy includes the constitutional and institutional mechanisms he put in place to entrench military power and conservative interests. The 2017 constitution, drafted by his junta and approved in a flawed referendum, gave the Constitutional Court authority to disband political parties and created an appointed Senate with extraordinary powers to shape governance.[^91] Even after Prayut's departure, these constitutional mechanisms continued to obstruct Thailand's democratic development, with the courts and Senate blocking reform-minded politicians from implementing the changes that voters had demanded.[^92]

Prayut's economic legacy is mixed at best. While he launched ambitious infrastructure projects and promoted the Thailand 4.0 vision, many initiatives stalled due to bureaucratic obstacles, land acquisition problems, and lack of genuine private sector confidence.[^93] The Eastern Economic Corridor, his flagship economic project, faced significant delays, with analysts noting that five years after its official launch, there were still no projects that private-sector partners could actually begin building, primarily due to land allocation problems.[^94] The high-speed rail projects with China were repeatedly delayed, with the Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima service pushed back to 2030, far behind original schedules.[^95]

Thailand's international standing deteriorated markedly under Prayut's leadership. The country was excluded from President Biden's 2021 Summit for Democracy, a symbolic rejection that highlighted Thailand's democratic backsliding.[^96] Relations with the United States, historically Thailand's most important Western ally, cooled significantly after the 2014 coup, with Washington reducing security cooperation and withdrawing military aid.[^97] While Prayut sought to compensate by strengthening ties with China, this pivot raised concerns about Thailand's strategic independence and its drift away from its traditional balanced foreign policy.[^98]

For Thailand's youth, Prayut's legacy is particularly negative. The massive protests that erupted in 2020-2021, led primarily by young Thais, represented a generational rejection of the political system that Prayut embodied.[^99] These protesters broke long-standing taboos by openly criticizing not just Prayut's government but also the monarchy's political role, demanding constitutional reforms that would genuinely democratize Thailand.[^100] Prayut's harsh response to these protests—using emergency powers, deploying police with water cannons, arresting hundreds of protesters, and prosecuting youth activists for lèse-majesté—alienated an entire generation and ensured that his name would be associated with repression in the minds of young Thais.[^101]

Despite his departure from politics, Prayut's undemocratic legacy continues to shape Thailand's political landscape. The institutional mechanisms he created, the precedents he set for military intervention in politics, and the polarization he exacerbated between conservative royalist forces and pro-democracy movements remain defining features of Thai politics.[^102] As one analysis concluded, "Prayut has retired, but his undemocratic legacy will live on" in the constitutional constraints, judicial activism, and military influence that continue to obstruct Thailand's democratic development.[^103]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters of Prayut Chan-o-cha, primarily drawn from Thailand's traditional conservative establishment, royalist circles, and some segments of the Bangkok middle class, have defended his tenure as a necessary intervention to restore order and protect national institutions during a period of dangerous political chaos. They argue that the 2014 coup prevented Thailand from descending into potential civil conflict, given the violent street protests that had paralyzed Bangkok and claimed dozens of lives in the months preceding military intervention.[^104]

Proponents point to Prayut's infrastructure development initiatives as evidence of his forward-thinking economic vision. The Thailand 4.0 policy and the Eastern Economic Corridor project, they contend, represented serious attempts to modernize Thailand's economy and move it up the value chain from low-skilled manufacturing to innovation-driven industries.[^105] Supporters credit Prayut with maintaining macroeconomic stability during his tenure, keeping inflation relatively low and preventing the economic volatility that characterized some earlier periods of Thai political turmoil.[^106]

Some conservative scholars and commentators have argued that Prayut's emphasis on the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Sufficiency Economy Philosophy represented a valuable alternative to Western-style capitalism and neoliberal economic policies that had failed to address inequality and sustainability.[^107] They view his promotion of the Bio-Circular-Green Economy model as positioning Thailand as a leader in sustainable development in Southeast Asia, addressing environmental concerns while promoting economic growth.[^108]

Defenders of Prayut's government have also argued that his firm handling of security issues in Thailand's restive southern provinces showed necessary resolve in dealing with the long-running insurgency that had claimed thousands of lives.[^109] They contend that his military background gave him credibility in managing national security challenges and maintaining public order during a period of intense political division that could have spiraled into worse violence.[^110]

Some analysts sympathetic to the military's political role have suggested that Prayut's authoritarian methods, while harsh, reflected a sincere if misguided belief that he was protecting Thailand's core institutions—particularly the monarchy—from existential threats posed by Thaksin Shinawatra's populist movement and its Red Shirt supporters.[^111] From this perspective, Prayut saw himself as a guardian of Thai tradition and stability, even if his methods violated democratic norms and human rights.[^112]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among international scholars, human rights organizations, democratic activists, and independent Thai academics is that Prayut Chan-o-cha's rule represented a devastating setback for democracy, human rights, and political development in Thailand. Human Rights Watch extensively documented the "unending repression" that characterized his tenure, noting that the five years following the 2014 coup were marked by intense government suppression of anyone viewed as a political threat.[^113]

Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College and Georgetown University, analyzed the regime's deep-seated insecurity and its reliance on coercive power rather than democratic legitimacy, arguing that Prayut's government constantly feared losing control and therefore could never risk genuine democratic processes.[^114] Academic Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a visiting scholar at Stanford University, characterized Prayut as more hardline and authoritarian than his military predecessors, representing a regression even by the standards of Thailand's previous military governments.[^115]

The respected Thai scholar and activist Sulak Sivaraksa decried Prayut's weaponization of the lèse-majesté law and publicly called for his removal from office, arguing that Prayut's government had perverted Thailand's genuine reverence for the monarchy into a political weapon used to silence legitimate criticism and dissent.[^116] International legal scholars have analyzed how Prayut's regime criminalized peaceful expression on an unprecedented scale, with the government filing charges against hundreds of individuals for speech-related "crimes" that would be constitutionally protected in democracies.[^117]

Reporters Without Borders designated Prayut a "predator of press freedom," documenting systematic censorship, intimidation of journalists, and the chilling effect his government created on independent media.[^118] From the first months of his rule, more than 20 journalists and bloggers fled Thailand to avoid imprisonment, establishing a pattern of media repression that would only intensify over his nine-year tenure.[^119]

Economic analysts have criticized Prayut's development programs as being heavy on rhetoric but light on implementation and results. While Thailand 4.0 and the Eastern Economic Corridor sounded ambitious, fundamental problems with land acquisition, bureaucratic obstacles, and lack of genuine private sector confidence meant that many headline projects either stalled completely or proceeded far behind schedule.[^120] Critics argue that the infrastructure spending of 1.8 trillion baht failed to generate the promised transformation, instead creating potential "white elephant" projects that consumed resources without delivering proportionate economic benefits.[^121]

International relations scholars have criticized Prayut's foreign policy as notably passive and reactive, even on regional issues where Thailand had traditionally played a leadership role within ASEAN.[^122] His government's gradual drift toward China, while partly a response to Western criticism of the coup, raised concerns about Thailand abandoning its historically balanced foreign policy and becoming excessively dependent on Beijing.[^123] The fact that Thailand was excluded from the Biden administration's Summit for Democracy symbolized the country's international isolation and damaged reputation under Prayut's authoritarian rule.[^124]

Perhaps the harshest scholarly assessments focus on Prayut's lasting damage to Thai political culture and institutions. Political scientists have analyzed how his regime worked to construct a veneer of legitimacy while systematically dismantling democratic safeguards, creating what some termed "stealth authoritarianism"—a system that maintained the appearance of constitutional governance while ensuring that genuine democratic competition could never threaten entrenched conservative and military interests.[^125] The 2017 constitution's design ensured that even after elections, the military and conservative establishment would retain veto power over reform efforts, creating institutional obstacles to democratic development that will persist long after Prayut's retirement.[^126]
