## Summary

In December 2018, Sudanese citizens—driven to desperation by tripled bread prices—began protesting in cities across the country. Within months, what started as "bread riots" became a revolution that ended Omar al-Bashir's 30-year dictatorship. On April 11, 2019, the military finally removed Bashir from power, but the struggle was far from over. Protesters refused to leave the streets until civilian rule was established.[^1]

The Khartoum sit-in became the revolution's heart: for two months, hundreds of thousands occupied the square outside military headquarters, demanding democracy. Then came tragedy. On June 3, 2019, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) massacred the protesters—over 120 killed, 70+ raped, bodies thrown into the Nile. Despite this horror, negotiations continued, and in August 2019, a transitional government was finally formed.[^2]

But Sudan's democratic transition did not last. In October 2021, the military staged a coup, ending the power-sharing arrangement. By April 2023, fighting erupted between the army and RSF, plunging Sudan into a catastrophic civil war that continues today. The revolution's promise remains unfulfilled—yet its memory endures as a moment when Sudanese believed change was possible.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Omar al-Bashir's Rule

Al-Bashir came to power in a 1989 coup and ruled for 30 years:

- **Islamist government:** Alliance with National Islamic Front/National Congress Party
- **Darfur genocide:** 300,000+ killed; ICC warrant (2009)—first against sitting head of state
- **Civil wars:** South Sudan seceded (2011) after decades of conflict
- **Economic control:** Corruption; elite enrichment
- **Security apparatus:** National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS); later RSF[^4]

### Economic Crisis

By 2018, Sudan faced severe economic problems:
- Loss of 75% of oil revenue after South Sudan secession
- Inflation over 70%
- Currency collapse
- Fuel shortages
- Bread prices tripled after subsidies removed

The International Monetary Fund's austerity demands intersected with regime corruption.[^5]

## The Revolution

### December 2018: "Bread Protests"

**December 19, 2018:** Protests erupted in Atbara (railway workers' city) over bread prices. Within days, spread nationwide.

**Early slogans:** "Bread, freedom, justice"
**Later evolution:** "Just fall, that's all!" (Tasqut bas)

The protests were the largest since 1985—and didn't stop.[^6]

### January-March 2019: Escalation

- Bashir declared state of emergency (February)
- Dissolved governments; installed military/intelligence officials
- Security forces killed dozens; thousands arrested
- Protests continued despite crackdowns
- Professional associations and civil society organized

The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) emerged as informal coordination body.[^7]

### April 6, 2019: The Sit-In Begins

**April 6:** Tens of thousands marched to military headquarters in Khartoum and began a sit-in demanding army intervention. The date: anniversary of 1985 uprising that toppled Nimeiry.

The sit-in became a protest city:
- Stages; music; lectures
- Field hospitals; food distribution
- Interreligious solidarity (Muslims, Christians, traditional religions)
- Women prominent organizers and participants
- Joy amid danger[^8]

### April 11, 2019: Bashir Falls

**April 11:** Defense Minister announced:
- Bashir arrested
- Constitution suspended
- Parliament dissolved
- Transitional Military Council (TMC) to rule for two years

Protesters rejected military rule—demanding civilian government—and stayed.[^9]

## The June 3 Massacre

### The Attack

At dawn on June 3, 2019, RSF forces attacked the sit-in:

**What happened:**
- Armed forces surrounded and attacked sleeping protesters
- Live ammunition, tear gas
- Rapes documented (70+ women and men)
- Bodies thrown into the Nile (at least 40)
- Internet shut down

**Deaths:** Over 120 killed between June 3-18 (Independent doctors' count)
- Some estimates: up to 241

The massacre shocked the world and radicalized the movement.[^10]

### Responsibility

The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo ("Hemedti"), was identified as the primary perpetrator. The RSF had evolved from Janjaweed militias responsible for Darfur atrocities.

An official investigation was mandated but never delivered accountability.[^11]

---

## Transition and Collapse

### August 2019: Power-Sharing Agreement

Despite the massacre, protests continued. Negotiations produced:

**August 17, 2019:** Constitutional Declaration signed
- Sovereign Council: Military and civilian members
- 39-month transition to elections
- Abdalla Hamdok as Prime Minister (civilian)

Sudan cautiously optimistic.[^12]

### October 2021: The Coup

**October 25, 2021:** General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan staged a coup:
- Arrested Hamdok and civilian ministers
- Dissolved Sovereign Council
- Declared state of emergency

Hamdok was reinstated in November 2021 but resigned in January 2022—the transition was dead.[^13]

### April 2023: Civil War

**April 15, 2023:** Fighting erupted between:
- Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF, al-Burhan)
- Rapid Support Forces (RSF, Hemedti)

The war continues (as of late 2024):
- 15,000+ killed
- 10+ million displaced
- Famine conditions
- Mass atrocities in Darfur[^14]

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Historic Uprising:** The Sudanese revolution was a peaceful, inclusive movement that accomplished the impossible—removing a dictator the world had failed to dislodge. The sit-in was a utopian moment of cross-ethnic, cross-religious solidarity. Women's leadership transformed Sudanese politics.[^16]

**Betrayed by Military:** The revolution was stolen by the very forces it sought to reform. June 3 was a war crime; the 2021 coup was theft. The ongoing war is a consequence of allowing militias to remain armed.

### Military/Government Perspective

**Stability vs. Chaos:** Military leaders argued they intervened to prevent collapse. The RSF (later) claimed to fight against Islamist restoration. Each side in the current war blames the other for Sudan's catastrophe.

### Critical Analysis

**Structural Failure:** The revolution succeeded in mobilization but faced an intractable problem: the military and RSF had no incentive to cede power and every incentive to maintain control over resources. Without security sector reform, civilian rule was always fragile.

**International Neglect:** The world watched Darfur, then the revolution, then the war—and intervened too little. Sudan's location, complexity, and lack of strategic profile left it abandoned.[^17]

## Legacy

### For Sudan

- Revolution's ideals remain—activists in exile continue struggle
- War has created humanitarian catastrophe
- Memory of sit-in as moment of possibility
- June 3 commemorated as martyrs' day

### For Africa

- Connected to broader "African Spring" (Algeria, also 2019)
- Demonstrated power of people even against entrenched regimes
- Also showed fragility of transitions

### Women's Role

- "Kandaka" (Nubian queens) imagery
- Women as organizers, not just participants
- Alaa Salah's viral image became global symbol[^18]
