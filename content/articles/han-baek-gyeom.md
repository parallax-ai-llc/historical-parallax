## Summary

Han Baek-gyeom (韓百謙, 1552-1615) was a pioneering Joseon Dynasty scholar, geographer, and historian who laid the foundations for Korea's practical learning (Silhak) movement. Best known for his masterwork *Dongguk Jiriji* (東國地理誌, Geography of the Eastern Kingdom), he revolutionized Korean historical geography through empirical research methods that challenged centuries of orthodox interpretation. His groundbreaking verification of the Three Han confederations' actual locations and his research on ancient land systems profoundly influenced later Silhak scholars including Yu Hyeong-won, Yi Ik, and Jeong Yak-yong, who called his theories "unchangeable established conclusions."[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Han Baek-gyeom was born in 1552 into the prestigious Cheongju Han clan, one of Korea's most distinguished aristocratic lineages. His courtesy name was Myeonggil (鳴吉) and his pen name was Guam (久菴). He was a seventh-generation descendant of Han Sang-gyeong (韓尙敬, 1360-1423), a founding merit subject of the Joseon Dynasty who rose to the position of Chief State Councilor, and a fifth-generation descendant of Han Gye-hui (韓繼禧), a Left Chancellor and cousin of the powerful Han Myeong-hoe.[^3][^4]

His father, Han Hyo-yun (韓孝胤), served as Magistrate of Gyeongseong, while his paternal uncle, Han Hyo-sun (韓孝純), was a leader of the Great Northerners faction and served as Left State Councilor during King Gwanghae's reign. This family background provided Han Baek-gyeom with both social status and connections to navigate the complex political landscape of late 16th-century Joseon.[^5]

Unlike many yangban aristocrats who pursued government positions as their primary goal, Han Baek-gyeom demonstrated an exceptional dedication to scholarship from his youth. He studied under Min Sun (閔純, pen name Haengchon 杏村), a disciple of the renowned philosopher Seo Gyeong-deok (Hwadamhak school), receiving instruction in fundamental Neo-Confucian texts including the *Lesser Learning* (*Sohak*) and the *Reflections on Things at Hand* (*Geunsa-rok*).[^6]

Han Baek-gyeom's early education instilled in him a rigorous approach to textual criticism and empirical verification that would characterize his later scholarly work. His teachers emphasized the importance of examining primary sources and questioning inherited assumptions—methodological principles that were still relatively uncommon in the orthodox Neo-Confucian scholarship of mid-Joseon Korea.[^7]

---

## Rise to Power

In 1579, at age 27, Han Baek-gyeom passed the *saengwon* examination, earning the licentiate degree that qualified him for government service. Unlike many of his contemporaries who immediately pursued administrative careers, he continued his scholarly pursuits while gradually entering officialdom. In 1585, when the Proofreading Office was established, he was appointed as a proofreading official alongside scholar Jeong Gu, working on the *Gyeongseo Hunhae* (經書訓解, Annotated Confucian Classics)—a position that demonstrated recognition of his scholarly expertise.[^8]

In 1586, through recommendations from influential officials, Han Baek-gyeom formally entered government service, holding positions including Junior Magistrate of the Central Ward, Magistrate of Gyeonggi Hall, and Junior Secretary in the Ministries of Taxation and Justice. He then received external appointments as Magistrate of Anak County in Hwanghae Province (serving two years), Magistrate of Hamjong County, and County Magistrate of Yeongwol in Gangwon Province.[^9]

His career suffered a significant setback in 1589 when he was implicated in the Jeong Yeo-rip treason case, one of the most significant political purges of the Seonjo era. Despite having no direct connection to the conspiracy, Han Baek-gyeom was exiled due to association with suspected conspirators—a common practice in Joseon's factional politics. However, this period of adversity proved temporary. When the Imjin War (Japanese invasions of 1592-1598) erupted, Han Baek-gyeom was released from exile and even earned the position of Director of the Royal Treasury for having executed collaborators who had encouraged rebellion in his place of exile.[^10]

Following his rehabilitation, Han Baek-gyeom held progressively senior positions: Junior Secretary of the Ministry of Taxation (1595), Junior Secretary of the Ministry of Justice (1601), and Magistrate of Cheongju (1602). His appointment to Cheongju was particularly significant, as it was the ancestral seat of his clan. In 1602, he was promoted to the senior third rank (*dangsanggwan*) and received the title of *tongjong taebu*, along with appointments as Director of the Office of Royal Funeral and Participant in the Ministry of Taxation.[^11]

A turning point came in 1608 when King Seonjo died. The high officials, recognizing Han Baek-gyeom's deep knowledge of ritual propriety, entrusted him with overseeing all funeral rites in the royal mortuary hall—a position of immense responsibility that demonstrated the court's confidence in his scholarship and character. In 1610, he was appointed as Provincial Pacification Commissioner of Gangwon Province, and in 1611, he received an appointment as Magistrate of Paju.[^12]

However, by this time, at age 60, Han Baek-gyeom's priorities had shifted decisively toward scholarship. He declined the Paju magistracy and retired to the countryside to devote himself entirely to his research in historical geography and classical studies, a decision that would prove enormously consequential for Korean intellectual history.[^13]

## Major Achievements

### Dongguk Jiriji (Geography of the Eastern Kingdom)

Han Baek-gyeom's greatest scholarly achievement was the *Dongguk Jiriji* (東國地理誌), which he began writing in 1614 and completed in June 1615, just months before his death. This work represented the first comprehensive historical geography written by a private individual in Korean history and marked the beginning of geography as an independent field of scholarly inquiry in Korea.[^14]

The *Dongguk Jiriji* consists of three major sections: accounts of tribal states (drawing from Chinese historical records), descriptions of the Three Kingdoms period (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla), and an analysis of the Goryeo Dynasty. For each kingdom, Han Baek-gyeom emphasized four key elements: national capitals (*gukdo*), territorial boundaries (*bonggang*), topographical characteristics (*hyeongse*), and defensive positions (*gwanbang*).[^15]

The work's methodology was revolutionary for its time. Han Baek-gyeom employed objective, empirical, and critical approaches to historical sources, systematically comparing Chinese and Korean records, identifying contradictions, and proposing new interpretations based on geographical evidence. He rejected the Confucian ideological framework that had dominated previous geographical works, instead adopting what modern scholars recognize as an early form of political geography.[^16]

### Verification of the Three Han Confederations

One of Han Baek-gyeom's most significant contributions was his verification of the actual locations of the Three Han confederations (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) that existed in southern Korea during the Proto-Three Kingdoms period. Previous scholars, including the renowned Choe Chi-won, had equated the Three Han with the Three Kingdoms, placing Mahan in Goguryeo territory, Jinhan in Silla, and Byeonhan in Baekje. The *Dongguk Saryak* had assigned them differently, with Mahan as Baekje, Byeonhan as Goguryeo, and Jinhan as Silla.[^17]

Han Baek-gyeom rejected these identification theories and argued that the Three Han existed exclusively south of the Han River, while the areas north of the river were occupied by Gojoseon and the Four Chinese Commanderies. He placed Mahan in the Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeolla regions; Jinhan in northern Gyeongsang Province; and Byeonhan (which he identified with Gaya) in southern Gyeongsang Province. This interpretation, based on careful analysis of geographical descriptions in Chinese sources, became the standard view adopted by most later Silhak scholars and remains largely accepted today.[^18]

### Research on the Jeongjeon (Well-Field) System

Han Baek-gyeom's other major scholarly achievement was his research on the *jeongjeon* (井田制, well-field system), an ancient land tenure system described in classical Chinese texts. In 1607, when Goguryeo palace ruins in Pyongyang were discovered, Han Baek-gyeom identified them as remnants of the well-field system supposedly established by Gija, the legendary founder of Gija Joseon. He developed the "Gijeon Yuje Theory" (箕田遺制說) and created the "Gijeon Diagram" (箕田圖) to illustrate his findings.[^19]

His research on this topic was compiled in the *Gijeon-go* (箕田考), though this work was actually edited and published in 1790 by Yi Ga-hwan and Yi Ui-jun, who collected Han Baek-gyeom's writings along with later commentaries by Yu Geun, Heo Seong, and Yi Ik. The significance of this work was that it provided empirical evidence for the historical existence of the well-field system, which the great Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi had dismissed as impractical.[^20]

This research profoundly influenced later land reform proposals by Silhak scholars. Yu Hyeong-won praised Han Baek-gyeom's work extravagantly, stating that "only Han Baek-gyeom in recent times deeply understood what had not been settled for a thousand years," and accepted his theories wholesale. The research provided theoretical foundation for Silhak scholars' advocacy of expanded public land systems and land redistribution.[^21]

### I Ching Scholarship

Beyond geography and land studies, Han Baek-gyeom was recognized as one of the foremost scholars of the *I Ching* (Book of Changes) in late Joseon Korea. His close friend, Chief State Councilor Yi Hang-bok (pen name Oseong), stated that while Han Baek-gyeom was broadly learned in all the Confucian classics, he had particularly deep expertise in the *I Ching*, and his contemporaries universally acknowledged him as a master of this text. He was entrusted with proofreading the state-published *Juyeok Jeonui* (周易傳義), demonstrating official recognition of his expertise.[^22]

According to the epitaph written by his friend Jeong Gyeong-se, who served as Chief Royal Secretary and Minister of Personnel, Han Baek-gyeom was thoroughly versed in the Six Classics, the Analects, and Mencius, as well as the writings of the Song Neo-Confucian masters (Lian, Luo, Guan, and Min schools), but his mastery of the *I Ching* was particularly exceptional.[^23]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Gija Joseon Problem

Han Baek-gyeom's identification of Goguryeo palace ruins in Pyongyang as remnants of Gija's well-field system has proven to be his most problematic legacy from a modern scholarly perspective. When well-organized palace ruins (actually influenced by Northern Wei's Luoyang city layout) were excavated in Pyongyang, Han Baek-gyeom enthusiastically declared that "evidence that Gija came to this land has appeared," and both the court and scholars celebrated this "discovery." This claim was recorded in the *Dongsa Gangmok* and became part of the orthodoxy supporting the "Gija Eastern Migration Theory" (箕子東來說) and the legitimacy of Gija Joseon.[^24]

Modern archaeological investigations have definitively proven that these "Gija's well-fields" and related relics were all constructed during the Goryeo-Joseon period and had no connection whatsoever to Gija or ancient land systems. This represents a significant error in Han Baek-gyeom's otherwise rigorous empirical methodology—an instance where ideological commitment to validating the Gija narrative overwhelmed critical analysis.[^25]

The Gija Joseon narrative itself has become controversial in modern Korean historiography, as it has been criticized for promoting a China-centric view of Korean origins and potentially legitimizing foreign cultural domination. Some nationalist historians have rejected the entire Gija tradition as a colonial myth. Han Baek-gyeom's enthusiastic promotion of Gija-related findings thus places him on the problematic side of this historiographical debate.[^26]

### Limitations of Historical Method

Modern historian Yi Ki-baek, while praising Han Baek-gyeom's innovations, noted in his preface to a modern edition of *Dongguk Jiriji* that "while his claims cannot necessarily be said to have been entirely correct, given the academic level of the time, his arguments were truly surprisingly fresh and new theories." This assessment acknowledges that while Han Baek-gyeom's empirical methodology represented a major advance, his specific conclusions were sometimes flawed due to the limitations of available evidence.[^27]

Some of Han Baek-gyeom's geographical identifications and historical claims have been revised or rejected by modern scholarship using archaeological evidence and more sophisticated textual analysis unavailable in the early 17th century. His work, while pioneering, represented an early stage of historical geography rather than definitive conclusions.[^28]

### Reception Among Neo-Confucian Orthodoxy

During his lifetime and immediately after, Han Baek-gyeom's research on the well-field system was not welcomed by mainstream Neo-Confucian scholars who followed Zhu Xi's skepticism about the historical existence of this ancient institution. His empirical approach, which contradicted the interpretations of the great Song master, was seen as heterodox by conservative scholars who prioritized doctrinal orthodoxy over historical evidence.[^29]

Only with the rise of the Silhak movement, which valued practical knowledge and empirical investigation over doctrinal purity, did Han Baek-gyeom's work receive the recognition it deserved. This delayed reception reflects the tension between empirical scholarship and ideological orthodoxy that characterized late Joseon intellectual life.[^30]

---

## Personal Life

Han Baek-gyeom married Lady Kim of the Hamchang Kim clan, and they were buried together in a joint tomb in Bupyeong-ri, Gangcheon-myeon, Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province. The tomb features traditional stone artifacts including a spirit tablet, grave marker, stone statue, and stone pillars with civil official statues. A stele (*shindo-bi*) erected in 1644, featuring a dragon-headed turtle base, was originally planned by his younger brother Han Jun-gyeom but completed by descendants after Han Jun-gyeom's death before finishing the project.[^31]

Han Baek-gyeom had at least one son, Han Heung-il (韓興一), who achieved even greater political success than his father, rising to the position of Right State Councilor during the reign of King Hyojong. This achievement led to Han Baek-gyeom being posthumously honored with the title of Chief State Councilor.[^32]

His younger brother, Han Jun-gyeom (韓浚謙), was even more politically prominent during his lifetime. A member of the Westerner faction known for his literary talents, Han Jun-gyeom was one of the seven officials who received King Seonjo's deathbed instructions. He served as Minister of Taxation and Commander of Five Provinces, and became King Injo's father-in-law, receiving the title Seopyeong Buwongun and serving as Chief of the Bureau of Royal Genealogy. The family's connection to the royal house through Han Jun-gyeom significantly elevated the Cheongju Han clan's status.[^33]

Despite his family's political prominence and his own successful official career, Han Baek-gyeom's personal preference was always for scholarship over administration. His decision at age 60 to decline the Paju magistracy and retire to focus entirely on research reflected a genuine commitment to learning that distinguished him from many yangban officials who viewed scholarship primarily as a credential for office-holding.[^34]

Han Baek-gyeom was known for his adherence to ritual propriety and classical learning. His appointment to oversee King Seonjo's funeral rites in 1608 demonstrated that he was recognized as an expert in Confucian ritual practice, not merely historical geography. His contemporaries described him as a scholar deeply versed in all aspects of classical learning.[^35]

He maintained close friendships with leading intellectuals and officials of his era, most notably Yi Hang-bok (1556-1618), the famous statesman known by his pen name Oseong. When Han Baek-gyeom died in the autumn of 1615, Yi Hang-bok was the first to weep at the news and composed an epitaph honoring his friend. Many other friends mourned his passing deeply, suggesting that Han Baek-gyeom was not only respected for his scholarship but also beloved personally.[^36]

## Legacy

Han Baek-gyeom's most enduring legacy was his role as a pioneer of the Silhak (practical learning) movement that would dominate progressive Korean intellectual life in the 17th and 18th centuries. Together with Yu Mong-in (柳夢寅), Yi Su-gwang (李睟光), and Heo Gyun (許筠), he was recognized as one of the founders of Silhak. His empirical, evidence-based approach to historical and geographical studies represented a methodological shift away from purely textual exegesis toward investigation of actual conditions—a hallmark of Silhak thought.[^37]

The *Dongguk Jiriji* established historical geography as an independent field of study in Korea. Its influence can be traced through later works including Shin Gyeong-jun's geographical sections in the *Dongguk Munheon Bigo* and Han Chi-yun's geographical treatises in the *Haedong Yeoksa*. The empirical methodology and organizational framework Han Baek-gyeom developed became the model for subsequent historical geographical research.[^38]

His work on the Three Han confederations established the geographical framework that Korean historians would use for the next four centuries. Modern scholarship has confirmed many of his identifications, and his basic placement of Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan south of the Han River remains the accepted view. This represents a rare case where early modern scholarship correctly resolved a historical problem that had confounded earlier scholars for centuries.[^39]

In the realm of land reform thought, Han Baek-gyeom's research on the well-field system provided crucial historical evidence that later Silhak scholars used to argue for land redistribution and public land expansion. Yu Hyeong-won's *Bangye Surok*, Yi Ik's writings, and Jeong Yak-yong's land reform proposals all built upon the historical foundation Han Baek-gyeom established. His work demonstrated that alternative land tenure systems had existed in Korean history, challenging the assumption that private ownership was natural or inevitable.[^40]

Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836), widely considered the greatest synthesizer of Silhak thought, declared in his geographical work *Abang Gangyeok-go* that "Han Baek-gyeom's theories are unchangeable established conclusions (*jeongron*)," representing the highest praise possible from Korea's most accomplished scholar of practical learning. This assessment cemented Han Baek-gyeom's reputation as a foundational figure in the intellectual tradition that Jeong Yak-yong himself perfected.[^41]

Modern Korean scholarship on historical geography explicitly traces its lineage to Han Baek-gyeom. He is recognized as having founded the political-geographical approach to studying Korean history, emphasizing the relationships between territory, state formation, and defensive strategy. His focus on national capitals, boundaries, topography, and defensive positions established the analytical framework that Korean historical geographers would employ for centuries.[^42]

Beyond specific scholarly contributions, Han Baek-gyeom's career exemplified an alternative model of yangban identity—one that prioritized scholarship and empirical investigation over political faction and office-holding. His willingness to retire from government service at age 60 to focus on research, his commitment to rigorous methodology even when it challenged orthodox interpretations, and his mentorship of fellow scholars represented an intellectual independence that would inspire later generations of Korean scholars.[^43]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Yu Hyeong-won (1622-1673), the influential Silhak philosopher and author of *Bangye Surok*, offered the most effusive contemporary praise of Han Baek-gyeom's scholarship. He wrote: "Only Han Baek-gyeom in recent times deeply understood what had not been settled for a thousand years through his arguments. I establish [my conclusions] based on his theories." This represented extraordinary praise in Confucian scholarly culture, where claims of having resolved millennial debates were not made lightly. Yu Hyeong-won completely accepted Han Baek-gyeom's theories on the well-field system and incorporated them into his own land reform proposals.[^44]

Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836), the towering figure of late Joseon Silhak thought, declared in his magisterial geographical work *Abang Gangyeok-go* that "Han Baek-gyeom's theories are unchangeable established conclusions (*jeongnon*)." For Jeong Yak-yong, who was himself a meticulous and critical scholar, to declare any earlier scholar's work "unchangeable" represented the highest possible endorsement. This assessment elevated Han Baek-gyeom to the status of an authoritative master whose conclusions did not require further verification.[^45]

Shin Gyeong-jun (1712-1781) and An Jeong-bok (1712-1791), both prominent Silhak scholars of the 18th century, acknowledged receiving substantial influence from Han Baek-gyeom's theories in their own geographical and historical research. Shin Gyeong-jun's geographical treatises in the *Dongguk Munheon Bigo* built directly upon the framework Han Baek-gyeom had established, while An Jeong-bok's historical writings referenced Han Baek-gyeom's geographical identifications as authoritative.[^46]

Yi Hang-bok (1556-1618), one of the most respected statesmen of the Seonjo and Gwanghae eras, praised Han Baek-gyeom as the greatest scholar of the *I Ching* of his generation. He stated that while Han Baek-gyeom was broadly learned in all the Confucian classics, his mastery of the Changes was particularly exceptional, and all their contemporaries recognized this expertise. This testimony from such a distinguished official confirmed Han Baek-gyeom's reputation as a classical scholar beyond his fame as a geographer.[^47]

Jeong Gyeong-se, who served as Chief Royal Secretary and Minister of Personnel, wrote Han Baek-gyeom's epitaph, describing him as a scholar thoroughly versed in the entire corpus of Confucian learning, from the Six Classics through the Song Neo-Confucian masters, with particular depth in the *I Ching*. When Han Baek-gyeom died, many friends wept bitterly, and Yi Hang-bok was the first to mourn him publicly—evidence that he was not merely respected intellectually but also deeply loved personally.[^48]

Modern scholars have recognized Han Baek-gyeom as the founder of political geography in Korea. His analytical framework—emphasizing capitals, boundaries, topography, and defensive positions—represented an early form of geopolitical thinking that anticipated modern approaches to historical geography. His work is credited with establishing geography as an independent field of scholarly inquiry in Korea, separate from purely descriptive gazetteers or administrative compendia.[^49]

The pioneering historian Yi Ki-baek (1924-2004) acknowledged that while not all of Han Baek-gyeom's specific conclusions have stood the test of time, "given the academic level of the time, his arguments were truly surprisingly fresh and new theories." Yi Ki-baek's assessment recognizes Han Baek-gyeom's methodological innovations as more significant than his specific claims—he introduced empirical, critical scholarship to Korean historical geography at a time when such approaches were rare.[^50]

### Negative Views

Despite the generally high regard in which later Silhak scholars held Han Baek-gyeom, his theories were not universally accepted during his lifetime. Conservative Neo-Confucian scholars who adhered strictly to Zhu Xi's interpretations rejected Han Baek-gyeom's claims about the well-field system. Zhu Xi had argued that the well-field system described in classical texts was either fictional or impractical, and mainstream Neo-Confucian scholarship after Zhu Xi generally accepted this view. Han Baek-gyeom's empirical evidence that such systems had actually existed in Korea thus contradicted the authoritative master, making his work unwelcome among orthodox scholars.[^51]

Modern archaeology has completely discredited Han Baek-gyeom's identification of Goguryeo palace ruins in Pyongyang as remnants of Gija's well-field system. Excavations and architectural analysis have proven that these structures date from the Goryeo-Joseon period and were influenced by Northern Wei Chinese palace architecture, with no connection to ancient land tenure systems or the legendary Gija. This represents a significant methodological failure—Han Baek-gyeom's ideological commitment to validating the Gija Joseon narrative apparently overrode his normally rigorous empirical approach.[^52]

Contemporary historians have also critiqued Han Baek-gyeom's promotion of the Gija Joseon narrative more broadly. The entire tradition of Gija as the founder of Korean civilization has been criticized by nationalist historians as a Sinocentric myth that portrayed Korea as a cultural colony of China. While this critique sometimes goes too far in the opposite direction, it raises legitimate questions about Han Baek-gyeom's uncritical acceptance of Chinese accounts of Korean origins. His enthusiasm for "Gija's well-fields" suggests he may have been more interested in confirming Confucian orthodoxy than critically examining Korean historical independence.[^53]

While Yi Ki-baek praised Han Baek-gyeom's methodological innovations, he also noted that "his claims cannot necessarily be said to have been entirely correct." Modern scholarship using archaeological evidence and more sophisticated textual criticism has revised or rejected some of Han Baek-gyeom's specific geographical identifications and historical claims. His work represented an early stage of scientific historical geography, not definitive scholarship, and should be understood within the limitations of early 17th-century evidence and methodology.[^54]

Some scholars have questioned whether Han Baek-gyeom's geographical determinism—his emphasis on topography, defensive positions, and territorial boundaries—oversimplified the complex factors driving historical change. While his geopolitical framework was innovative, it sometimes led him to explain historical developments primarily through geographical factors while underemphasizing political, economic, and cultural dynamics. This reductionism, critics argue, limited the explanatory power of his historical analysis.[^55]

Additionally, Han Baek-gyeom's work focused almost exclusively on political and territorial history, paying little attention to social, economic, or cultural developments. This reflected the priorities of traditional Confucian historiography, which emphasized the deeds of rulers and the rise and fall of states. Later Silhak scholars, particularly Jeong Yak-yong, would develop more comprehensive approaches that examined social institutions, economic systems, and popular culture alongside political geography.[^56]
