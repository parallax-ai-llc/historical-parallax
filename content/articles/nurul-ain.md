## Summary

Sulṭāna Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah was the fifteenth ruler of the Aceh Sultanate in northern Sumatra, reigning from October 1675 until her death in January 1678.[^1] She was the second of four consecutive female rulers (sultanas) who governed Aceh during a remarkable 58-year period of female sovereignty from 1641 to 1699.[^2] During her brief but significant reign, she implemented crucial administrative reforms including the formalization of the three-sagi regional system and perfected the constitutional law known as Kanun Al-Asyi, though her rule was also marked by tragedy when the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque and the royal palace were destroyed by fire.[^3][^4] Her reign represents a unique chapter in Islamic history where female leadership was legitimized through both Islamic jurisprudence and indigenous adat (customary law).[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Very little is known about the early life of Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah, as historical records from this period are fragmentary and often contradictory. Contemporary Dutch East India Company (VOC) sources provide no information about her relationship with the previous sultan's family or her upbringing.[^6] However, according to a manuscript preserved at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, she was identified as the daughter of Malik Mahmud Qithul Kahar Syah, who was the son of Sulayman, son of Abdul Jalil, son of Sultan Alauddin al-Kahar.[^7] This genealogy, if accurate, would connect her to one of Aceh's most important royal lineages, tracing her ancestry to Sultan Alauddin al-Kahar, the third Sultan of Aceh who reigned during the 16th century.[^8]

The scant biographical information reflects the broader challenges of reconstructing the lives of women in pre-modern Southeast Asian history, where male chroniclers often focused on political events rather than personal details. What is clear is that she was known by the title "Sri Para Puteri" before ascending to the throne, suggesting she held noble status within the Acehnese court.[^9] The succession crisis following the death of Sultanah Taj ul-Alam in October 1675 created the circumstances for her ascension, as the previous ruler died without children or known close relatives, necessitating the selection of another woman from the royal lineage to maintain stability.[^10]

The political environment in which she was raised was one where female sovereignty had already been established as legitimate and functional. Her predecessor, Sultanah Taj ul-Alam Safiatuddin Syah, had ruled successfully for 34 years (1641-1675), demonstrating that women could effectively govern a major Islamic sultanate.[^11] This precedent would have shaped the young Nurul Alam's understanding of political possibility and religious legitimacy. The Acehnese court during this period was a cosmopolitan center of Islamic learning, attracting scholars from across the Muslim world, and the atmosphere of intellectual vibrancy likely influenced her political education.[^12]

Unlike many royal women confined to the harem, the sultanas of Aceh exercised real political power and engaged directly with foreign envoys, religious scholars, and local nobility. Growing up in this environment, Nurul Alam would have witnessed the workings of governance firsthand, observing how her predecessor balanced the competing interests of the uleebalang (regional chiefs), ulama (religious scholars), and foreign trading partners.[^13] The system of matrilineal succession that had emerged in Aceh, combined with Islamic jurisprudence that permitted female leadership under specific conditions of necessity, created a unique political culture that made her eventual ascension possible.[^14]

## Rise to Power

The ascension of Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah to the throne of Aceh occurred during a period of political transition following the death of Sultanah Taj ul-Alam on October 23, 1675.[^15] The succession process in 17th-century Aceh was complex, involving consultation between multiple power centers including the uleebalang chiefs, the Council of Orangkaya (noble elders), and the religious establishment led by the Kadi Malikul Adil (Chief Islamic Judge).[^16] At this time, the position was held by Syekh Abdurrauf Singkel (also known as Syiah Kuala), one of the most respected Islamic scholars in the entire Malay world, whose support proved crucial for legitimizing female rule.[^17]

Nurul Alam was officially enthroned on October 23, 1675, taking the regnal name Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah.[^18] Her selection represented continuity with the established practice of female sovereignty that had begun with Taj ul-Alam's accession in 1641. The legitimacy of her rule rested on several foundations: first, the precedent of successful female governance under her predecessor; second, Islamic legal opinions (fatwas) that permitted women to rule in circumstances where no suitable male heir existed and where the welfare of the Muslim community (maslaha) required stable leadership; and third, the support of indigenous adat traditions that recognized matrilineal inheritance patterns.[^19][^20]

The transition of power appears to have been relatively smooth, suggesting broad acceptance among the Acehnese political elite. Unlike male rulers who often derived legitimacy from military prowess and charismatic authority, the sultanas relied on different sources of power: piety, learning, judicial fairness, and collaborative governance.[^21] Contemporary sources indicate that the sultanas adopted a more consultative style of leadership, working closely with the Council of Orangkaya and deferring to religious authorities on matters of Islamic law.[^22] This collaborative approach helped maintain political stability during a period when centralized royal authority had significantly declined following the death of the powerful Sultan Iskandar Muda in 1636.[^23]

The regional chiefs, or uleebalang, wielded considerable power during this period, and the three-sagi system that divided Aceh into regional federations (XXII Mukims, XXV Mukims, and XXVI Mukims) had to approve each new sultan's accession.[^24] This requirement effectively gave the uleebalang veto power over royal succession, representing a significant check on central authority. Nurul Alam's successful accession suggests she had secured the support of these powerful regional magnates, likely through negotiations mediated by the religious establishment and senior court officials.[^25]

Her rise to power also occurred against the backdrop of Aceh's ongoing commercial importance in the regional spice trade. Despite political fragmentation, Aceh remained a crucial player in the pepper trade, controlling approximately half of the world's pepper production during this period.[^26] The sultanas' pragmatic economic policies and maintenance of trade relationships with both European companies (particularly the Dutch VOC) and regional partners helped sustain Aceh's commercial prosperity, which in turn provided resources that legitimized their rule.[^27]

## Major Achievements

The most significant achievement attributed to Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah was the perfection and formalization of Aceh's administrative structure through the three-sagi regional system.[^28] While chronicles initially attributed the creation of this system to her, more recent scholarship suggests that the basic framework was established by her predecessor, Sultanah Taj ul-Alam, and that Nurul Alam's contribution was to refine and institutionalize it.[^29] The three sagis—known as Sagi XXII Mukim, Sagi XXV Mukim, and Sagi XXVI Mukim, named after the number of districts (mukim) in each region—created a federal structure that balanced central authority with regional autonomy.[^30]

This administrative reform had profound political implications. Each sagi was governed by a council of uleebalang chiefs who collectively represented the interests of their territories. The three sagis together held the power to approve or reject the appointment of new sultans, effectively creating a constitutional check on royal authority.[^31] This system can be understood as a formalization of the power shift that had occurred after the death of Sultan Iskandar Muda, when centralized authority gave way to a more decentralized feudal structure. By codifying this arrangement, Nurul Alam brought legal clarity to political relationships and helped prevent succession disputes.[^32]

Equally important was her role in perfecting the Kanun Al-Asyi, also known as Adat Meukuta Alam, which served as the sultanate's constitutional law.[^33] This legal code synthesized Islamic legal principles (Sharia) with indigenous Acehnese customary law (adat), creating a hybrid legal framework that reflected Aceh's unique cultural and religious identity. The perfection of this code was undertaken with the guidance of Kadi Malikul Adil Syekh Abdurrauf Singkel and required approval from the People's Court Assembly, demonstrating the collaborative and consultative nature of her governance.[^34]

The Kanun Al-Asyi was particularly important for suppressing opposition from the Wujudiyah faction, a mystical Islamic movement that had caused theological controversies in Aceh during the previous decades.[^35] By establishing clear legal guidelines rooted in both Sharia and adat, the sultana helped restore religious and political consensus. This achievement underscores the sultanas' emphasis on legal institutionalization and rule of law as opposed to the personal charismatic authority favored by earlier male rulers.[^36]

During her reign, Nurul Alam maintained Aceh's important position in regional trade networks. The sultanate continued to export pepper, spices, and forest products while importing textiles, metals, and luxury goods.[^37] Trade relationships with the Dutch East India Company (VOC), despite occasional tensions, remained functional and provided important customs revenues to the royal treasury.[^38] The sultanas' pragmatic approach to foreign relations prioritized commercial stability over military adventurism, a shift from the more aggressive policies of Sultan Iskandar Muda's era.[^39]

The sultana also continued the tradition of royal patronage for Islamic scholarship that had made Aceh a major center of Muslim learning in Southeast Asia. During the period of the four sultanas (1641-1699), prominent ulama such as Abdurrauf Singkel produced important works, including the first complete Qur'an translation into Malay (Tarjuman al-Mustafid) and treatises on Sufism and Islamic law.[^40][^41] The sultanas' support for religious education and missionary activities—including sending scholars to propagate Islam in Siam in 1668—demonstrated their commitment to Islamic civilization and helped legitimize their rule in religious terms.[^42]

Furthermore, Nurul Alam's reign contributed to a broader transformation in Acehnese political culture. The peaceful succession of female rulers, their emphasis on consultative governance, and their protection of private property and social welfare represented a shift away from the militaristic and autocratic style of earlier male sultans.[^43] This evolution toward more institutionalized, law-based governance, though often overlooked in traditional histories focused on military conquest, had lasting effects on Acehnese political traditions.[^44]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The reign of Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah was marked by a catastrophic disaster that destroyed much of Aceh's architectural and cultural heritage. During her rule, the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque—the spiritual center of the sultanate originally built in 1612 under Sultan Iskandar Muda—was consumed by a violent conflagration along with the sultan's palace in Kutaraja (present-day Banda Aceh).[^45][^46] Contemporary sources record that royal heirlooms, treasures, and important documents were also lost in the fire, representing an irreparable loss of cultural patrimony.[^47] While there is no evidence that the sultana bore personal responsibility for this disaster, it occurred on her watch and likely weakened the symbolic authority of the throne.

The brevity of her reign—barely two and a half years—has led some historians to question whether she had sufficient time to implement meaningful reforms or whether the administrative achievements attributed to her were actually continuations of policies initiated by her predecessor.[^48] The scholarly debate centers on whether Nurul Alam genuinely "perfected" the three-sagi system or merely formalized arrangements that had already emerged organically during Taj ul-Alam's long reign.[^49] This uncertainty reflects the general paucity of detailed historical records about her specific actions and decisions.

Critics of female rule in Aceh, both contemporary and later, argued that the succession of sultanas represented a departure from proper Islamic governance. Although prominent ulama like Abdurrauf Singkel supported the sultanas and never questioned their authority, other voices in the Muslim world expressed reservations.[^50] These criticisms would eventually culminate in 1699 when a fatwa purportedly from Mecca declaring female rule contrary to Islamic principles was used to depose the last sultana, Kamalat Zainatuddin Syah.[^51] While this fatwa did not affect Nurul Alam during her lifetime, the debate it represented—about the legitimacy of female sovereignty in Islamic contexts—created an undercurrent of controversy throughout the sultanas' era.

Modern scholars have argued that opposition to the sultanas was more politically and economically motivated than genuinely religious.[^52] The uleebalang chiefs, who had gained significant autonomy during the period of female rule, may have found women rulers easier to manipulate than strong male sultans. Some historians suggest that the sultanas were essentially figureheads while real power rested with regional chiefs and religious authorities.[^53] This interpretation, however, has been challenged by recent scholarship that demonstrates the sultanas actively shaped policy, engaged in diplomatic correspondence, and made independent decisions.[^54]

Another source of criticism concerns the overall decline of Aceh's military and political power during the sultanas' period. While Sultan Iskandar Muda had conquered territories throughout Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, creating an empire that rivaled the major Southeast Asian kingdoms, the sultanas adopted a largely defensive posture.[^55] Territorial losses, reduced military expeditions, and the growing influence of European colonial powers marked this era. Critics have blamed female leadership for this decline, though objective analysis suggests that broader economic changes, the exhaustion of Aceh's military resources under Iskandar Muda, and the rising power of European maritime technology were more significant factors than the gender of the rulers.[^56]

The sultanas' collaborative governance style, while promoting stability and institutionalization, may also have accelerated the fragmentation of central authority. The three-sagi system, perfected under Nurul Alam, essentially created a confederation where regional chiefs held veto power over the throne.[^57] This arrangement prevented the emergence of another autocratic ruler like Iskandar Muda but also made it difficult to coordinate unified action against external threats. The tension between stability and effectiveness remained an unresolved challenge throughout the sultanas' period.

## Personal Life

Historical records provide frustratingly little information about the personal life of Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah. Unlike the extensive documentation available for some of her male predecessors, particularly Sultan Iskandar Muda, contemporary sources offer almost no details about her family relationships, personality, or private affairs.[^58] This absence reflects both the limitations of available sources and the conventions of 17th-century historiography, which rarely focused on the intimate lives of rulers, especially female ones.

According to some Acehnese chronicles—though not confirmed by contemporary Dutch or other foreign sources—Nurul Alam was the mother of a daughter named Puteri Raja Setia.[^59] If accurate, this would make her the grandmother of the Acehnese royal line through her daughter, who succeeded her as Sultanah Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah (r. 1678-1688).[^60] However, the reliability of this genealogical claim remains uncertain, as later chronicles sometimes fabricated family connections to legitimize succession patterns retroactively.[^61]

The cultural context of 17th-century Aceh suggests that the sultanas, while exercising public authority, would have navigated complex social expectations about female comportment and modesty. Dutch sources indicate that foreign envoys who visited the Acehnese court during the sultanas' period described elaborate protocols that maintained the rulers' dignity while accommodating Islamic norms of female modesty.[^62] Men serving under the queens' rule were described as "very submissive and respectful, not daring to do anything until they had thoroughly acquainted her regarding the matter," and the sultana would send her official seal (chap) as a signal of permission.[^63]

Unlike European queens who often ruled through regents or male advisors, the Acehnese sultanas appear to have exercised direct authority, participating in council meetings, receiving foreign ambassadors, and making policy decisions.[^64] This suggests a personality capable of commanding respect in a political culture where authority traditionally belonged to men. The fact that Nurul Alam successfully navigated the complex politics involving uleebalang chiefs, religious scholars, and foreign traders indicates considerable political acumen and diplomatic skill.

The religious dimension of her personal identity was likely significant. The sultanas cultivated an image of piety and Islamic learning, performing their religiosity as a form of "moral capital" that legitimized their rule.[^65] This emphasis on pious behavior represented a shift from the more secular charisma of military prowess favored by male predecessors. Whether Nurul Alam possessed genuine religious devotion or strategically performed piety for political purposes cannot be determined from available sources, though the distinction may be anachronistic; in 17th-century Islamic culture, political legitimacy and religious authority were deeply intertwined.[^66]

Her death on January 23, 1678, after a reign of approximately two years and three months, suggests she may have been relatively young or perhaps succumbed to illness.[^67] The brevity of her reign, combined with the lack of records about health problems or succession struggles, leaves the circumstances of her death mysterious. She was succeeded smoothly by Sultanah Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah, suggesting that succession arrangements had been made in advance or that the procedures for selecting a new sultana had become routinized by this point.[^68]

## Legacy

Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah's legacy must be understood within the broader context of the four sultanas who ruled Aceh from 1641 to 1699, representing one of the most remarkable periods of female sovereignty in Islamic history.[^69] Her specific contributions—the perfection of the three-sagi administrative system and the Kanun Al-Asyi constitutional law—had lasting effects on Acehnese political structure, creating institutions that survived long after the end of female rule.[^70] The federal system she formalized became deeply embedded in Acehnese political culture, with the uleebalang continuing to wield significant regional power into the colonial period.[^71]

More broadly, the sultanas' collective legacy challenged assumptions about gender and Islamic governance. The fact that a Muslim sultanate could be successfully ruled by women for nearly six decades demonstrated that female sovereignty was compatible with Islamic law and practice when supported by appropriate jurisprudential reasoning and customary traditions.[^72] Prominent scholars like Abdurrauf Singkel produced works explicitly defending the legitimacy of female rulers, creating a body of Islamic legal thought that contradicted the more restrictive interpretations that eventually led to the sultanas' removal in 1699.[^73]

The period of the sultanas, including Nurul Alam's reign, is often described as Aceh's "transition" from the military glory of Iskandar Muda's era to the fragmentation and eventual colonization of the 19th and 20th centuries.[^74] However, recent scholarship has reframed this narrative, arguing that the sultanas' emphasis on institutional governance, rule of law, and diplomatic pragmatism represented a different but equally valid form of statecraft.[^75] Their collaborative style and protection of property rights may have better served Aceh's long-term interests than continued military adventurism would have done.

The architectural and cultural losses from the fire during Nurul Alam's reign—including the destruction of the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque and the royal palace—represent a tragic aspect of her legacy.[^76] These buildings, which embodied Aceh's architectural heritage and Islamic identity, had to be rebuilt by subsequent rulers, with the mosque undergoing multiple reconstructions over subsequent centuries.[^77] The loss of royal treasures and documents also impoverished the historical record, making it more difficult for later generations to understand Aceh's golden age.

In contemporary Aceh and Indonesia more broadly, the sultanas have experienced a revival of interest and appreciation. Feminist scholars and activists have pointed to the sultanas as evidence of indigenous Islamic traditions that empowered women, contrasting these with more restrictive interpretations of gender roles.[^78] The sultanas feature in discussions about women's leadership in Muslim societies, offering historical precedent for female political participation.[^79] Streets, institutions, and monuments in Banda Aceh commemorate the sultanas, integrating them into official narratives of Acehnese identity and pride.

The legacy of Nurul Alam and her sister sultanas also raises important questions about how history is written and remembered. For centuries, they were either ignored in mainstream histories or dismissed as evidence of decline. Recent scholarship, particularly Sher Banu Khan's comprehensive study "Sovereign Women in a Muslim Kingdom: The Sultanahs of Aceh, 1641-1699" (2017), has fundamentally revised this assessment, using Dutch archival materials and indigenous sources to reconstruct a more accurate picture of their reigns.[^80] This scholarly recovery represents a broader trend in Southeast Asian historiography toward recognizing women's agency and contribution.

Ultimately, Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah's legacy is inseparable from the larger phenomenon of female rule in 17th-century Aceh. Her brief reign contributed to a grand experiment in Islamic governance that demonstrated both the possibilities and limitations of female sovereignty in a patriarchal world. The administrative institutions she helped create, the legal frameworks she refined, and the example she set of female political leadership continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about Islam, gender, and governance in Southeast Asia.[^81]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has increasingly recognized the sultanas of Aceh, including Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah, as effective rulers who governed during a complex transitional period in Southeast Asian history. Sher Banu Khan's groundbreaking research has been particularly influential in revising historical assessments, demonstrating through extensive archival work that the sultanas actively shaped policy and exercised genuine political authority rather than serving as mere figureheads.[^82] Khan argues that the sultanas developed distinctive leadership styles characterized by collaboration with elites, emphasis on legal institutions, and protection of social welfare—approaches that represented sophisticated responses to the political realities of 17th-century Aceh rather than weakness or incompetence.[^83]

The sultanas' emphasis on piety and Islamic learning as sources of legitimacy has been interpreted positively by scholars who see this as a shift from the militaristic charisma of earlier rulers toward more sustainable forms of governance.[^84] By grounding their authority in religious scholarship and judicial fairness, the sultanas created a political culture that valued law and consultation over autocratic decree. This development anticipated modern concepts of constitutional governance and the rule of law, making the sultanas' period intellectually progressive despite lacking the military glory of earlier reigns.[^85]

Islamic feminists and scholars of women's history have celebrated the sultanas as proof that Islamic traditions can accommodate female leadership when communities are willing to engage seriously with jurisprudential possibilities.[^86] The fact that respected ulama like Abdurrauf Singkel not only accepted but actively defended female sovereignty demonstrates that restrictive interpretations of gender and leadership are not inevitable in Islamic contexts.[^87] The treatises produced by 17th-century Acehnese scholars justifying female rule on grounds of maslaha (public interest) and darurah (necessity) provide important precedents for contemporary debates about women's political participation in Muslim societies.[^88]

The administrative reforms attributed to Nurul Alam, particularly the formalization of the three-sagi system, have been recognized as important contributions to Acehnese political development. By creating formal structures that balanced central authority with regional autonomy, she helped institutionalize governance in ways that promoted stability and prevented the emergence of destructive autocracy.[^89] Some scholars argue that these institutional developments better positioned Aceh to navigate the challenges of an increasingly complex regional environment than continued reliance on military conquest would have done.[^90]

The sultanas' diplomatic pragmatism and maintenance of trade relationships during a period of increasing European maritime power has also received positive assessment. Rather than engaging in futile military resistance against technologically superior colonial forces, the sultanas prioritized commercial relationships that sustained Aceh's economy and preserved its autonomy for as long as possible.[^91] This pragmatic approach, while less heroic than military resistance, may have better served Acehnese interests given the geopolitical realities of the period.[^92]

Contemporary Acehnese perspectives increasingly view the sultanas with pride as symbols of their region's unique Islamic heritage and tradition of gender equality.[^93] The sultanas appear in educational curricula, public monuments, and cultural productions as examples of Acehnese exceptionalism and progressive Islamic practice.[^94] This rehabilitation represents a significant shift from earlier periods when the sultanas were either ignored or viewed as embarrassments.

### Negative Views

Despite recent scholarly reassessment, criticisms of the sultanas, including Nurul Alam, persist in some quarters. The most common critique focuses on the military and territorial decline of Aceh during the period of female rule, contrasting the sultanas' defensive posture with Sultan Iskandar Muda's aggressive expansion.[^95] Critics argue that female rulers, lacking military experience and the cultural authority to lead soldiers into battle, could not prevent the erosion of Acehnese power and territorial integrity that occurred during the 17th century.[^96]

Some historians have characterized the sultanas' period as one of political fragmentation where real power shifted to uleebalang chiefs and religious authorities, with the sultanas serving as symbolic figureheads who lacked genuine political agency.[^97] According to this interpretation, the collaborative governance praised by revisionist scholars actually reflected the sultanas' weakness and inability to impose their will on competing power centers.[^98] The formalization of the three-sagi system, rather than being an administrative achievement, represented the institutionalization of the sultanate's fragmentation and the central authority's diminishment.[^99]

Religious conservatives, particularly those influenced by later interpretations of Islamic law that became dominant after the 1699 fatwa ending female rule, continue to view the sultanas' period as illegitimate or aberrant.[^100] While 17th-century Acehnese ulama like Abdurrauf Singkel supported female rule, later Islamic scholars increasingly adopted more restrictive views about women's political participation.[^101] From this perspective, the sultanas represented a deviation from proper Islamic governance that was rightfully corrected when male rule was restored.[^102]

The catastrophic fire that destroyed the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque and royal palace during Nurul Alam's reign has been interpreted by some as symbolic of the sultanas' failure to preserve Aceh's cultural heritage and political prestige.[^103] While the sultana bears no personal responsibility for what was likely an accident, the disaster occurred during her watch and contributed to a broader narrative of decline and misfortune associated with the period of female rule.

Critics have also questioned the extent of the sultanas' actual accomplishments, suggesting that achievements attributed to them may have been primarily the work of male advisors, religious scholars, and court officials.[^104] According to this skeptical view, the sultanas provided royal legitimacy while real decision-making occurred elsewhere, making their historical significance more symbolic than substantive.[^105] This interpretation, however, reflects broader prejudices about women's political capabilities rather than engagement with specific historical evidence.

Some nationalist and pan-Islamic critics have faulted the sultanas for their accommodating stance toward European colonial powers, particularly the Dutch VOC.[^106] From this perspective, the commercial treaties and diplomatic relationships maintained during the sultanas' period represented a form of collaboration that facilitated eventual European domination of the region.[^107] More militant historians argue that aggressive military resistance would have been preferable to the pragmatic diplomacy pursued by the sultanas, even if such resistance would likely have failed.[^108]

The debate over the sultanas' legacy thus reflects broader tensions in how communities remember their past: between celebrating unique achievements and lamenting lost glory, between progressive reinterpretation and conservative tradition, between acknowledging women's agency and minimizing their significance. Sultanah Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah, like her sister sultanas, remains a contested figure whose historical assessment continues to evolve as new sources are discovered and new questions are asked.[^109]
