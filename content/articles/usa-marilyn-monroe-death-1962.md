## Summary

On August 5, 1962, the most famous movie star in the world was found dead in her Brentwood home, naked in bed, a telephone receiver in her hand. Marilyn Monroe was 36 years old. The coroner ruled it "probable suicide" from acute barbiturate poisoning. But from the moment the news broke, the questions began. Was it really suicide? Could it have been an accident? Or was Marilyn Monroe murdered—and if so, by whom?[^1]

The conspiracy theories have never stopped. They center on two men: John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, with both of whom Monroe allegedly had affairs. The theories suggest that Marilyn knew too much—about the Kennedys, about American intelligence, about something—and was silenced. The theories range from the plausible to the absurd: CIA hit squads, Mafia revenge, a cover-up by the men who loved her. None have been proven. The 1982 investigation found no evidence of foul play.[^2]

What remains is the mystery of a woman whose public persona was so carefully constructed that even her death became a screen for projection. The lonely blonde who couldn't handle fame. The dangerous woman who knew too many secrets. The victim of powerful men. Sixty years later, Marilyn Monroe is still more myth than person—and her death is still debated because it was hers, and because it happened at all.[^3]

## The Event

### August 4-5, 1962

**That Saturday evening:**
- Monroe at home on Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood
- Alone (housekeeper Eunice Murray present that night)
- Made phone calls during evening
- Last known conversation: Around 7:30-8:00 p.m.

**Midnight onward:**
- Timeline disputed
- Murray said she noticed light under Monroe's door at 3:30 a.m.
- Found door locked; called psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Greenson
- Greenson broke window; found Monroe dead

**Official time of death:**
- Uncertain; estimated 8:30-10:30 p.m.
- Body discovered ~3:30 a.m. August 5
- Police notified ~4:25 a.m.

**The delay in calling police is one of many disputed points.**[^4]

### The Death Scene

**What was found:**
- Monroe nude in bed, face down
- Telephone receiver in hand (or nearby)
- Empty pill bottles (Nembutal, chloral hydrate)
- No suicide note

**The autopsy:**
- Massive barbiturate overdose
- Nembutal: Lethal levels in blood
- Chloral hydrate: Also detected
- Cause: Acute barbiturate poisoning
- Manner: "Probable suicide"

**Why "probable"?**
- Coroner couldn't be certain
- No clear suicide method (no water glass found for pills)
- Some evidence puzzled investigators[^5]

---

## The Suicide Theory

### Why It's Plausible

**Monroe's history:**
- Previous suicide attempts (at least 2-3)
- Long history of depression
- Substance abuse (barbiturates, alcohol)
- Recent setbacks: Fired from film, struggling career
- Troubled relationships
- Psychiatric care for years

**Her mental state:**
- Recently expressed despair
- Pattern of self-destructive behavior
- Barbiturate dependency well-documented

**The coroner's view:**
- Thomas Noguchi (yes, same as RFK case, as assistant)
- Called it probable suicide
- Consistent with her history

**Most historians accept this explanation.**[^6]

## The Murder Theories

### The Kennedy Connection

**The alleged affairs:**
- Monroe reportedly had affair with JFK (1962)
- Then possibly with RFK
- Sources: Various biographers, witnesses
- Neither Kennedy confirmed

**The theory:**
- Monroe threatened to expose affairs
- She "knew too much"
- Kennedys (or allies) silenced her

**Variations:**
- Robert Kennedy allegedly visited her that night (disputed)
- She was going to hold press conference
- She had a "red diary" with secrets

**The evidence:**
- Circumstantial at best
- No definitive proof of murder
- 1982 DA investigation: No evidence of foul play[^7]

### The Mafia Theory

**The theory:**
- Mafia killed Monroe to hurt Kennedys
- Bobby Kennedy was aggressive against organized crime
- Monroe's death would embarrass them

**The evidence:**
- Some figures had motive
- No direct evidence
- Speculative[^8]

### The Accidental Overdose/Cover-Up

**Anthony Summers' theory (1985):**
- Monroe accidentally overdosed
- But: Her doctors/Kennedy associates covered up
- Body moved; scene staged
- To protect the Kennedys

**The theory:**
- Explains timeline discrepancies
- Explains delayed police call
- No murder, but deception

**Status:** Plausible scenario; not proven[^9]

### The Injection Theory

**The puzzle:**
- Massive barbiturate levels in blood
- But: No residue in stomach
- If she swallowed pills, where was evidence in digestive system?

**Possible explanations:**
- Suppository/enema administration
- Injection
- Rapid absorption

**Biographer Donald Spoto:**
- Theory: Lethal enema killed her
- Administered by her doctors (accidentally)
- Covered up as suicide

**Status:** Alternative explanation; debated[^10]

## Why Does the Mystery Persist?

### Celebrity and Tragedy

**Marilyn's image:**
- Most famous woman in the world
- Symbol of beauty, vulnerability
- Death at 36: Tragic, shocking

**The need to explain:**
- Random overdose seems too senseless
- Conspiracy provides meaning
- Murder suggests she mattered enough to kill

### Kennedy Factor

**The timing:**
- JFK president; RFK AG
- If affairs were real, scandal potential
- Post-assassination (JFK 1963), suspicion grew

**Pattern recognition:**
- JFK killed (1963)
- RFK killed (1968)
- Monroe dead (1962)
- Conspiracy thinking links them

### The Unknown

**What we don't know:**
- Full truth of her relationships
- What happened in final hours
- Why timeline discrepancies
- Who called whom
