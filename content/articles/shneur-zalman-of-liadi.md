## Summary

Shneur Zalman of Liadi was the founder of Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidism and the author of the Tanya, one of the most important works of Jewish mystical philosophy. His system, known as Chabad (an acronym of Wisdom, Understanding, Knowledge), emphasized intellectual contemplation as the path to spiritual experience. He was arrested twice by the Russian authorities on charges of treason. Chabad-Lubavitch eventually became one of the most influential Jewish movements worldwide.
