## Summary

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was a Hindu saint and mystic who founded the Gaudiya Vaishnavism tradition and is considered by his followers to be an incarnation of Krishna. He popularized the practice of congregational chanting (sankirtan) of the names of God, particularly the Hare Krishna mantra. His ecstatic devotion and philosophy of achintya bheda abheda (inconceivable oneness and difference) profoundly influenced Bengali and Indian spiritual culture. He was the spiritual ancestor of the modern Hare Krishna movement.
