## Summary

William Franklin Graham Jr., known worldwide as Billy Graham, was one of the most influential evangelical Christian leaders of the 20th century.[^1] Born on November 7, 1918, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Graham preached the Gospel to nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries through his evangelistic crusades over a career spanning six decades.[^2] He served as spiritual advisor to multiple U.S. presidents and became known as "America's Pastor," receiving both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medal.[^3] Despite his massive influence and widespread admiration, Graham's legacy remains complex, marked by controversies over his initial acceptance of segregation, his political relationships—particularly with Richard Nixon—and antisemitic remarks captured on White House tapes.[^4] He died on February 21, 2018, at age 99, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shape evangelical Christianity while prompting ongoing debates about faith, politics, and social justice.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

William Franklin Graham Jr. was born on November 7, 1918, in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Frank and Morrow Graham, who owned a prosperous 300-acre dairy farm.[^6] The eldest of four children, young "Billy Frank," as he was called, grew up immersed in the routines of farm life, rising early to milk cows and perform other agricultural duties.[^7] His parents were devout Christians who instilled strong religious values in their children, though Graham later described his childhood faith as nominal rather than deeply personal.[^8]

The pivotal moment in Graham's spiritual life occurred on November 1, 1934, when at age 16 he attended a revival meeting led by traveling evangelist Mordecai Ham.[^9] During this meeting in Charlotte, Graham experienced a profound religious conversion and "made a decision for Christ," a moment he later identified as the turning point that would determine the entire course of his life.[^10] This conversion experience awakened in him a sense of calling to Christian ministry that would soon reshape his educational and professional aspirations.

Graham's educational journey reflected both his spiritual awakening and his search for the right theological training. In 1936, he left the family dairy farm to attend Bob Jones College (now Bob Jones University) in Cleveland, Tennessee, but stayed only one semester, finding the institution's extreme fundamentalism stifling.[^11] He transferred to Florida Bible Institute near Tampa, where he flourished spiritually and academically, graduating in 1940.[^12] That same year, he was ordained as a minister by the Southern Baptist Convention, formally beginning his ministerial career.[^13]

Recognizing gaps in his education, Graham enrolled at Wheaton College in Illinois, a respected evangelical liberal arts institution.[^14] It was at Wheaton that he met Ruth McCue Bell, daughter of L. Nelson Bell, a medical missionary to China.[^15] Ruth had been born in Qingjiang, Jiangsu, China, and spent her formative years there before coming to the United States for education.[^16] The two shared a deep commitment to Christian faith and missionary service, and they married on August 13, 1943, shortly after graduation.[^17] This partnership would prove foundational to Graham's ministry, with Ruth providing stability, wisdom, and spiritual insight throughout their nearly 64-year marriage.[^18]

## Rise to Prominence

Billy Graham's transformation from a young Southern Baptist preacher to an internationally recognized evangelical leader was neither immediate nor inevitable. After graduating from Wheaton College, he served as pastor of the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, and became involved with the Youth for Christ organization, where his dynamic preaching style began to attract attention.[^19] His energetic, passionate delivery and ability to connect with young audiences set him apart from many traditional preachers of his era.[^20]

The defining moment in Graham's ascent to national prominence came in the fall of 1949 with the Los Angeles Crusade.[^21] Originally scheduled for three weeks, the crusade extended to eight weeks as crowds swelled and media attention intensified.[^22] Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, impressed by Graham's anti-communist rhetoric and patriotic messages during the early Cold War, reportedly sent a telegram to his editors: "Puff Graham."[^23] The resulting media coverage catapulted the young evangelist into the national spotlight, transforming what had been a regional ministry into a nationwide phenomenon.[^24]

Building on this momentum, Graham established the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) in 1950 to organize and manage his growing ministry.[^25] The organization would become one of the most influential evangelical institutions in the world, coordinating massive crusades, producing radio and television programs, and publishing Christian literature.[^26] Graham's 1957 New York Crusade at Madison Square Garden, which lasted an unprecedented 16 weeks, further cemented his status as America's preeminent evangelist.[^27] The crusade drew massive crowds nightly and demonstrated Graham's ability to appeal across denominational, racial, and class lines in America's most cosmopolitan city.[^28]

Graham's influence extended beyond the pulpit through media innovation. He embraced radio, television, and film as tools for evangelism at a time when many conservative Christians viewed such technologies with suspicion.[^29] His radio program, "Hour of Decision," reached millions of listeners, while his televised crusades brought his message into homes across America and eventually around the world.[^30] In 1956, Graham founded Christianity Today magazine, which became the flagship publication of evangelical Christianity and provided theological depth to complement his evangelistic fervor.[^31]

Perhaps most significantly, Graham cultivated relationships with political leaders that gave him unprecedented access to power. Beginning with President Dwight Eisenhower and continuing through nearly every administration until his retirement, Graham became known as the "pastor to presidents."[^32] These relationships enhanced his stature and influence but would also become a source of controversy and criticism, particularly regarding his political neutrality and judgment.[^33]

## Major Achievements

Billy Graham's achievements in evangelism and Christian ministry are staggering in their scope and impact. Over his career, he preached the Gospel to an estimated 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories through various meetings and crusades.[^34] More than 3.2 million people responded to invitations at Graham Crusades to "accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior," while hundreds of millions more were reached through television, video, film, and webcasts.[^35] These numbers represent an evangelistic reach unmatched by any other Christian leader in history.

Graham's crusades became legendary events that drew unprecedented crowds. The largest audience in his ministry's history assembled at Yoido Plaza in Seoul, South Korea, in 1973, where 1.1 million people gathered to hear him preach.[^36] His crusades were meticulously organized, involving months of preparation, thousands of volunteers, and cooperation among churches across denominational lines.[^37] Graham pioneered a model of cooperative evangelism that brought together Catholics, mainline Protestants, and evangelicals in common cause, though this ecumenical approach sometimes drew criticism from fundamentalists who viewed such cooperation as theological compromise.[^38]

The organizational and institutional legacy of Graham's ministry extends far beyond the crusades themselves. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, founded in 1950, became a model for modern religious organizations, employing professional management practices and maintaining financial transparency at a time when many ministries operated with little accountability.[^39] Christianity Today magazine, which Graham founded in 1956, provided intellectual heft to the evangelical movement and helped evangelicals articulate a theology that engaged contemporary issues without abandoning orthodox Christianity.[^40]

Graham's role in global evangelicalism was particularly significant. The 1974 International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland, which Graham convened, brought together 2,400 delegates from 150 countries and helped evangelicals see themselves as a worldwide Christian force rather than merely an American phenomenon.[^41] The Lausanne Covenant that emerged from this congress became one of the most important statements of evangelical belief and mission in the modern era.[^42]

His influence on American civic religion and political culture was profound. At Graham's strong encouragement, President Eisenhower held the first National Prayer Breakfast in 1953, establishing a tradition that continues today.[^43] Graham's emphasis on the compatibility of Christianity and American patriotism, particularly during the Cold War, helped shape a civil religion that blended evangelical faith with nationalist sentiment.[^44] His counsel to presidents from Eisenhower through Obama gave evangelical Christianity a voice in the highest levels of government.[^45]

Graham received numerous honors recognizing his impact. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1996.[^46] In 2001, Queen Elizabeth II awarded him an honorary knighthood.[^47] He appeared on Gallup's list of "Most Admired Men" more than 60 times, ranking in the top ten almost every year since the poll began in 1948.[^48] Upon his death in 2018, Graham became only the fourth private citizen in United States history to lie in honor at the United States Capitol rotunda, and the first religious leader to receive this distinction.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his widespread popularity and influence, Billy Graham's career was marked by significant controversies that have complicated his legacy. His stance on racial segregation during the Civil Rights era remains one of the most debated aspects of his ministry. During his early years of preaching, Graham freely accepted the custom of segregated seating at his southern crusades.[^50] While he eventually took some stands against segregation—most notably tearing down ropes separating "white" and "colored" seating sections at a 1953 rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee[^51]—critics argue he never risked his popularity by confronting segregation head-on.[^52]

Graham's relationship with the Civil Rights movement was characterized by what scholars have called "equivocal positions."[^53] Though his statements against segregation were ahead of many white Southern evangelicals, when pressed by critics he often softened his views, saying "We follow the existing social customs in whatever part of the country in which we minister."[^54] He criticized marches and sit-ins as tactics, preferring gradual change through personal conversion rather than direct action.[^55] This approach led Martin Luther King Jr., with whom Graham maintained a respectful relationship, to receive troubling news that Graham was holding a crusade in San Antonio, Texas, with the state's staunchly segregationist governor set to introduce him—which Graham proceeded to do as planned.[^56]

One Graham biographer controversially claimed that "there wasn't a major Protestant leader in America who obstructed King's Beloved Community more than Billy Graham did," suggesting that Graham's moderate stance actually impeded progress.[^57] While Graham personally removed barriers at some crusades and refused invitations to preach in South Africa if audiences remained segregated,[^58] scholars describe his approach to racial integration as "middle-of-the-road average," which led him to partner with oilmen and business leaders rather than Civil Rights activists.[^59]

Graham's political relationships, particularly with Richard Nixon, proved deeply damaging to his reputation. Graham's friendship with Nixon dated to the 1950s when Nixon served as vice president, and it became his closest and most costly political alliance.[^60] Graham credited himself more than any other person for Nixon's decision to pursue the presidency again in 1968, and he actively supported Nixon's campaigns.[^61] However, as the Watergate scandal unfolded, Nixon reportedly told aides, "Don't let Billy Graham near me, I don't want him tarred with Watergate."[^62] Graham later expressed regret about his political entanglements, saying in 2011 that although grateful to have met politicians who have spiritual needs like everyone else, he sometimes crossed the line and would have preferred to avoid politics.[^63]

The most personally damaging controversy emerged in 2002 when the National Archives released tapes of a February 1, 1972 conversation between Graham and President Nixon.[^64] On the tapes, Graham openly voiced a belief that Jews control the American media, calling it a "stranglehold" that "has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain."[^65] Graham told Nixon that Jews did not know his true feelings about them and what "they are doing to this country."[^66] Initially, Graham denied making such statements, but when the tapes were released, he was forced to issue multiple apologies.[^67]

Graham's first apology was brief and claimed he had no memory of the conversation, but after continued controversy, he issued a lengthier statement: "Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon—some 30 years ago. They do not reflect my views and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks."[^68] While Jewish community leaders accepted his apology, the relationship between Graham and Jewish organizations was permanently damaged.[^69] The tapes revealed a troubling disconnect between Graham's public persona as a unifying religious figure and his private expressions of prejudice.[^70]

## Personal Life

Billy Graham's personal life was characterized by a deep, enduring marriage and a family committed to Christian ministry, though not without challenges. His marriage to Ruth McCue Bell Graham was by all accounts extraordinarily strong and mutually supportive. Married on August 13, 1943, the couple remained together until Ruth's death on June 14, 2007, at age 87—a marriage of almost 64 years.[^71] Ruth, born in China to Presbyterian missionary parents, brought a global perspective and spiritual depth that complemented Billy's evangelistic fervor.[^72]

Their marriage faced unique strains due to Billy's extensive travel schedule. Between 1945 and 1958, Ruth gave birth to five children—Virginia (Gigi), Anne, Ruth (known as Bunny), Franklin, and Nelson Edman (Ned)—whom she often raised single-handedly while Billy was away on extended national and international evangelistic crusades.[^73] The family made their home in Montreat, North Carolina, near Ruth's parents, where they lived for the rest of their married life in a modest log cabin-style house that contrasted sharply with the grandeur Graham could have afforded.[^74] Despite the challenges of frequent separation, their faith remained central to their relationship. "A night never went by, when we were together, without us holding hands and praying before we went to sleep," Graham said in a tribute to his wife.[^75]

The Graham children's experiences growing up with an often-absent father who belonged to the world had complex consequences. All five children became involved in Christian ministry to varying degrees, with eldest son Franklin eventually heading the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.[^76] However, the family also struggled with challenges including divorce, substance abuse, and the pressures of living in the shadow of one of the world's most famous Christians.[^77] These struggles, while painful, humanized a family that could easily have been idealized and demonstrated the real costs of Graham's demanding ministry schedule.

Graham himself was known for his personal integrity and commitment to financial transparency, which set him apart from many televangelists and religious leaders of his era. Early in his ministry, he convened a meeting of his core team in Modesto, California, in 1948, where they established what became known as the "Modesto Manifesto"—a set of guidelines addressing money, sexual temptation, publicity, and relationships with local churches.[^78] Graham insisted on receiving a fixed salary from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association rather than taking love offerings, a practice that protected him from accusations of financial impropriety.[^79] He also made it a policy never to be alone with a woman other than his wife, a practice later dubbed "the Billy Graham rule," which he maintained to avoid even the appearance of sexual misconduct.[^80]

Graham's personality combined genuine humility with a sophisticated understanding of media and public relations. Friends and colleagues consistently described him as genuinely humble and self-effacing in private, often expressing surprise and discomfort with the adulation he received.[^81] Yet he was also a savvy operator who understood how to work with the press, cultivate political relationships, and build a global ministry organization.[^82] This combination of authentic piety and strategic acumen made him uniquely effective but also opened him to charges of calculation and compromise.[^83]

## Legacy

Billy Graham's legacy is multifaceted and contested, reflecting both his extraordinary achievements and his significant failures. When he died on February 21, 2018, the media response was immediate, heartfelt, and deeply contentious, with scholars and journalists debating his legacy both for evangelicals and for the world at large.[^84] Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan called him "America's Pastor," and he became the fourth private citizen in United States history to lie in honor at the United States Capitol rotunda, the first religious leader to be so honored.[^85]

Graham's impact on American evangelicalism cannot be overstated. He helped transform evangelicalism from a marginalized, largely Southern and fundamentalist movement into a major force in American religious and political life.[^86] His emphasis on cooperative evangelism across denominational lines, his embrace of media technology, and his cultivation of intellectual respectability through institutions like Christianity Today helped create the infrastructure for modern evangelicalism.[^87] Generations of evangelical pastors, missionaries, and leaders trace their spiritual lineage to Graham's ministry, either through conversion at his crusades or through inspiration from his example.[^88]

His influence on American civic religion and the relationship between evangelicalism and political power remains profound and controversial. Graham's close relationships with presidents helped legitimize evangelical Christianity in the corridors of power and contributed to the religious language that became increasingly common in American politics from the 1950s onward.[^89] The National Prayer Breakfast, established at Graham's encouragement, became an annual ritual bringing together political and religious leaders.[^90] However, this political engagement also set a precedent that many scholars believe contributed to the close identification of white evangelicalism with conservative politics and ultimately with Donald Trump.[^91]

The question of Graham's relationship to contemporary evangelical politics has become central to debates about his legacy. Graham's death came at a time of significant crisis among evangelicals following the 2016 election, in which 81% of white evangelical Christians voted for Donald Trump.[^92] This led scholars to turn a more critical eye on Graham, debating whether to see him as the progenitor of—or as a quiet rebuke to—today's evangelical politics.[^93] Graham's willingness to hold causes like Civil Rights, welfare programs, and gender equality at arm's length while focusing on personal salvation has been re-examined in light of contemporary evangelical political stances.[^94]

Graham's approach to racial justice represents one of the most complicated aspects of his legacy. While he took symbolic stands against segregation and befriended Martin Luther King Jr., his refusal to join the Civil Rights movement more forcefully, his criticism of direct action tactics, and his "middle-of-the-road" approach meant that he neither led nor significantly contributed to the dismantling of Jim Crow.[^95] Some scholars argue that his immense popularity and moral authority could have made a decisive difference had he chosen to use it more boldly on behalf of racial justice.[^96]

The evolution of Graham's views over his long life offers another dimension to his legacy. His views on many subjects, including nuclear proliferation, the environment, global humanitarianism, and women's ordination, changed over time, generally becoming more progressive.[^97] This capacity for growth has led some defenders to argue that assessments of Graham should account for his willingness to reconsider positions and admit mistakes.[^98] However, critics note that these evolutions often came late and only after significant pressure, raising questions about whether they represented genuine conviction or pragmatic adaptation.[^99]

Graham's global impact extends far beyond the United States. His crusades on every continent, his support for indigenous evangelistic movements, and his role in convening global evangelical gatherings like the Lausanne Congress helped create a truly international evangelical movement.[^100] Evangelical Christianity's growth in the Global South, Latin America, and Asia during the late 20th century cannot be attributed solely to Graham, but his ministry was an important catalyst and model.[^101]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and religious leaders who view Graham's legacy positively emphasize his role as a unifying figure who brought respectability and visibility to evangelical Christianity. Grant Wacker, a leading Graham biographer, describes him as "among the most influential Christian leaders" of the 20th century, noting that his crusades provided a template for mass evangelism that balanced emotional appeal with organizational sophistication.[^102] Defenders point to Graham's consistent message of the Gospel, his personal integrity in an era when many televangelists fell into scandal, and his genuine humility despite worldwide fame.[^103]

Supporters highlight Graham's courage in taking stands against segregation when many white evangelicals remained silent or actively defended Jim Crow. While acknowledging his approach was gradual rather than revolutionary, they note that Graham personally removed segregation barriers at crusades as early as 1953, decades before many Southern institutions integrated.[^104] His friendship with Martin Luther King Jr., though complicated, represented a willingness to cross racial lines that was rare among white evangelical leaders of his generation.[^105]

Graham's defenders also emphasize his role in preventing evangelical Christianity from becoming entirely synonymous with political conservatism. Though he had conservative instincts and friendships with Republican presidents, Graham maintained relationships across party lines and expressed views on poverty, nuclear weapons, and humanitarian concerns that did not fit neatly into partisan categories.[^106] His emphasis on personal conversion rather than political ideology as the primary Christian calling offered an alternative to the culture war mentality that later dominated much of evangelicalism.[^107]

The institutional legacy Graham created—the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Christianity Today, the Lausanne Movement—continues to shape global Christianity. These organizations have adapted to changing times while maintaining commitments to evangelism and orthodox Christianity, providing infrastructure and intellectual resources for multiple generations of believers.[^108] Graham's insistence on financial accountability and his establishment of the "Modesto Manifesto" created standards that protected both his ministry and many others from the scandals that have plagued religious organizations.[^109]

Finally, supporters note the sheer number of people who found faith or renewed commitment to Christianity through Graham's ministry. While conversion statistics are notoriously difficult to verify and track long-term, the testimonies of millions who credit Graham with introducing them to Christian faith represent a legacy that transcends political controversies and institutional achievements.[^110] For these individuals and their families, Graham's impact is deeply personal and overwhelmingly positive.[^111]

### Negative Views

Critics of Billy Graham's legacy focus on what they see as his failures to use his enormous influence on behalf of justice, his compromising entanglements with political power, and the ways his ministry model contributed to problematic trends in American Christianity. Scholars have increasingly challenged the hagiographic narratives that dominated discussions of Graham during his lifetime, pointing to substantial evidence of moral failures and missed opportunities.[^112]

The most serious criticism concerns Graham's approach to racial justice. While he took symbolic stands against segregation, critics argue he actively obstructed the Civil Rights movement by providing an alternative, gradualist approach that allowed white Christians to feel good about their racial attitudes without supporting structural change.[^113] His criticism of sit-ins and marches, his willingness to appear with segregationist politicians, and his advice to King to slow down and focus on evangelism rather than direct action all contributed to a climate that impeded rather than advanced racial justice.[^114] Some historians argue that no major Protestant leader did more to obstruct King's vision of the Beloved Community than Graham precisely because his moderate stance gave cover to white Christians who wanted to avoid the uncomfortable demands of the Civil Rights movement.[^115]

Graham's political relationships, particularly with Nixon, reveal a pattern of poor judgment and excessive deference to power. The antisemitic remarks on the Nixon tapes were not isolated comments but part of a broader pattern of telling powerful people what they wanted to hear.[^116] Critics note that Graham's initial denial of these remarks and his claim not to remember them strain credulity and suggest a willingness to lie to protect his reputation.[^117] The tapes also revealed Graham's support for Nixon's "Southern Strategy," which exploited racial fears for political gain, contradicting his public statements about racial reconciliation.[^118]

Some scholars argue that Graham's model of evangelical engagement with politics laid groundwork for the Religious Right's fusion of Christianity with partisan politics. While Graham himself maintained some distance from partisan activism, his legitimization of evangelical political engagement and his messaging that conflated Christianity with American nationalism helped create conditions for the alliance between white evangelicals and the Republican Party.[^119] The fact that 81% of white evangelicals voted for Trump, despite his manifest moral failures, can be traced in part to patterns Graham established of valuing political access over prophetic witness.[^120]

Critics also question the superficiality of Graham's evangelistic approach. His emphasis on individual conversion moments without corresponding attention to discipleship, social ethics, or structural sin created what some call "cheap grace"—a version of Christianity focused on personal salvation without meaningful transformation of life or society.[^121] The millions who "made decisions for Christ" at Graham crusades often had little connection to local churches or sustained Christian formation, raising questions about the depth and durability of these conversions.[^122]

The financial success of Graham's ministry, while managed more ethically than many religious organizations, still represented a troubling commodification of the Gospel. The massive budgets, sophisticated marketing, and celebrity culture surrounding Graham's crusades reflected and reinforced an American Christianity more focused on success metrics and public relations than on costly discipleship.[^123] This model of ministry-as-business has been widely replicated, often with far less integrity than Graham maintained, contributing to widespread cynicism about religious leaders.[^124]
