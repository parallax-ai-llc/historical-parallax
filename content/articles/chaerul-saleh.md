## Summary

Chaerul Saleh Datuk Paduko Rajo (1916-1967) was an Indonesian independence hero, politician, and statesman who played a pivotal role in Indonesia's declaration of independence. A member of the radical Menteng 31 youth group, he participated in the controversial Rengasdengklok incident that pressured Sukarno and Hatta to declare independence in 1945.[^1] He later served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Development, and Chairman of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) during Sukarno's presidency. Despite his anti-communist stance, he died in detention under the New Order government in 1967, making him one of the tragic figures of Indonesia's tumultuous political transition.[^2]

## Early Life and Background

Chaerul Saleh was born on September 13, 1916, in Sawahlunto, West Sumatra, a mining town during the Dutch colonial period.[^3] He was the only child of Dr. Achmad Saleh, a respected physician who had been proposed as a member of the Volksraad (People's Council), and Zubaidah binti Ahmad Marzuki.[^4] When Chaerul was two years old, his parents divorced, and his mother took him to Lubuk Jantan, Lintau, in Tanah Datar.[^5] At age four, his father brought him to Medan to ensure he received a proper education.

His early education reflected the opportunities available to the Indonesian elite during the colonial period. He attended the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS) in Bukittinggi from 1924 to 1931, a Dutch-language primary school reserved for Europeans and privileged indigenous children.[^6] He then continued to the Hogere Burger School (HBS) section B in Medan, completing his secondary education in Jakarta between 1931 and 1937.[^7] This rigorous Dutch education system provided him with fluency in multiple languages and exposure to Western political ideas that would shape his nationalist consciousness.

In 1937, at age 21, Chaerul enrolled at the Rechts Hoge School (Law School) in Jakarta, where he studied law until 1942.[^8] During his university years, his political activism intensified. He became deeply involved in the nationalist movement, serving as chairman of the Persatuan Pemuda Pelajar Indonesia (United Indonesian Youth Students) from 1940 to 1942.[^9] This organization brought together Indonesian students in Jakarta and Bandung who were committed to the independence struggle. It was during this formative period that Chaerul developed his radical nationalist ideology and forged connections with other young revolutionaries who would become key figures in Indonesia's independence movement.

The Japanese occupation from 1942 disrupted his formal legal studies, but it provided new opportunities for nationalist activism. The Japanese, seeking to mobilize Indonesian support for their war effort, created organizations and training programs that inadvertently strengthened the independence movement. Chaerul became part of the militant youth organizations that would play a decisive role in pushing for immediate independence in 1945.

## Rise to Power

Chaerul Saleh's rise to prominence began during the critical final months of World War II and the immediate aftermath of Japan's surrender. He became a leading figure in the Menteng 31 group, named after the building at Jalan Menteng 31 in Jakarta that served as a dormitory for radical Indonesian youth during the Japanese occupation.[^10] Originally Hotel Schomper I, the building housed young revolutionaries including Adam Malik, Sukarni, and A.M. Hanafi, who formed the Angkatan Baru Indonesia (New Generation of Indonesia).[^11] These young militants were impatient with the cautious approach of older nationalist leaders and demanded immediate, unilateral declaration of independence without Japanese permission.

On August 15, 1945, news of Japan's surrender reached Indonesian nationalist leaders. The following day, Chaerul Saleh, along with Sukarni, Wikana, and other Menteng 31 youths, carried out the dramatic Rengasdengklok incident.[^12] At approximately 4:00 AM on August 16, they kidnapped Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta and took them to Rengasdengklok, a small town in Karawang, about 50 kilometers east of Jakarta.[^13] The purpose was twofold: to pressure the two leaders to immediately declare independence without waiting for approval from the Japanese-sponsored Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI), and to isolate them from Japanese influence during the power vacuum following Japan's surrender.[^14]

The kidnapping created a crisis that ultimately accelerated the proclamation. Chaerul Saleh and his colleagues argued that Indonesia's independence should be a decision of the Indonesian people, not a gift from Japan.[^15] They disagreed that PPKI members, many of whom were Japanese civil servants, should participate in approving the proclamation text.[^16] After tense negotiations mediated by Admiral Maeda and other figures, Sukarno and Hatta returned to Jakarta and proclaimed Indonesian independence on August 17, 1945.[^17] Chaerul Saleh's bold action established him as one of the key pemuda (youth) revolutionaries who forced the hand of history.

Following independence, Chaerul became the first Chairman of the BKPRI (Central Committee for Indonesian Workers) after Indonesia's first Youth Congress, consolidating his position as a youth leader.[^18] However, his radical politics soon brought him into conflict with the post-independence government. In January 1946, he joined the Persatuan Perjuangan (Struggle Front), a coalition of leftist organizations formed by Tan Malaka in Surakarta on January 4-5, 1946.[^19] Chaerul became chairman of the Political Bureau of Struggle, a powerful position within the organization.[^20] The Persatuan Perjuangan opposed the diplomatic approach of Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir's government and rejected the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations that would lead to the Linggajati Agreement.[^21]

This opposition led to his first imprisonment. On March 17, 1946, the Sjahrir government arrested several Persatuan Perjuangan leaders, including Chaerul Saleh, viewing them as threats to the fragile republic.[^22] He remained imprisoned from February 1950 to 1952 for being considered a violator of Republic of Indonesia government law.[^23] This period of detention was followed by an unexpected opportunity: President Sukarno arranged for him to continue his legal education at the University of Bonn in West Germany from 1952 to 1955.[^24] During his time in Germany, Chaerul organized Indonesian students and helped establish the Perhimpunan Pelajar Indonesia (PPI), the Indonesian Students Association.[^25] He returned to Indonesia in 1956 with a law degree and renewed political ambitions.

## Major Achievements

Chaerul Saleh's major achievements span both Indonesia's independence struggle and his subsequent political career during the Sukarno era. His most historically significant contribution was his role in forcing the proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945. As one of the architects of the Rengasdengklok incident, he belongs to the small group of pemuda revolutionaries who shaped the timing and manner of Indonesia's birth as a nation.[^26] The decisive action taken by Chaerul and his fellow Menteng 31 members ensured that independence was declared during the brief power vacuum following Japan's surrender, before Allied forces could arrive to restore Dutch colonial control.

Upon returning from Germany in 1956, Chaerul re-entered Indonesian politics during the tumultuous period of parliamentary democracy. In 1957, he joined the Djuanda Cabinet, serving as Minister of State for Veterans Affairs.[^27] This appointment recognized both his status as an independence hero and his organizational abilities. In this role, he demonstrated his capacity for practical governance, addressing the needs of veterans from the independence struggle who had often been neglected in post-independence politics.

In 1959, when President Sukarno dissolved the elected parliament and inaugurated the period of "Guided Democracy," Chaerul's political career reached new heights. He was appointed as Junior Minister for Basic Industry and Mining in the First Working Cabinet, and in subsequent cabinets became full Minister for Basic Industry and Mining.[^28] This portfolio placed him at the center of Indonesia's economic development strategy during a period when Sukarno emphasized nation-building and economic self-sufficiency.

One of Chaerul Saleh's most enduring contributions to Indonesian statecraft was his role in developing the archipelagic state concept and the Djuanda Declaration of December 13, 1957.[^29] As Minister of Veterans Affairs, Chaerul approached Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, a legal expert on the law of the sea, with the idea that Indonesia's territorial seas should encompass all waters between the nation's islands.[^30] In a revealing anecdote, Chaerul initially proposed a territorial sea of 17 nautical miles, since seventeen was a "sacred number" for Indonesia (which declared independence on August 17, 1945), but abandoned the idea after Mochtar insisted that 12 miles would be difficult enough to defend internationally.[^31] The resulting declaration that Indonesia had "absolute sovereignty" over all waters within straight baselines connecting its outermost islands laid the foundation for what would eventually become the internationally recognized archipelagic state concept in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.[^32] This concept fundamentally reshaped maritime law and remains one of Indonesia's most significant contributions to international law.

As a founding leader of Partai Murba (established in 1948 with Tan Malaka, Sukarni, and Adam Malik), Chaerul promoted a distinctive "national communist" ideology that blended Marxist principles with fervent Indonesian nationalism.[^33] Partai Murba explicitly rejected the Soviet-aligned orthodoxy of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), arguing that Indonesia's revolutionary path required adaptation to local cultural and economic conditions rather than dogmatic adherence to Comintern models.[^34] Chaerul and his Murba colleagues positioned their party as a proletarian alternative that prioritized anti-imperialist nationalism over class warfare dictated by Moscow.[^35]

By February 1966, Chaerul held the powerful combined positions of Third Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS), making him one of the most influential figures in Sukarno's government.[^36] He had served as MPRS Chairman since 1960, presiding over the assembly that provided constitutional legitimacy to Sukarno's Guided Democracy system.[^37] In this capacity, he opened major MPRS sessions, including the crucial First Session on November 10, 1960, which heard President Sukarno's state addresses.[^38] His leadership of the MPRS demonstrated his political skills and his ability to navigate the complex factional politics of Sukarno's Indonesia.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his nationalist credentials, Chaerul Saleh's political career was marked by significant controversies that ultimately contributed to his tragic downfall. His involvement in the Rengasdengklok incident, while celebrated by some as decisive revolutionary action, was criticized by others as an act of insubordination that bordered on treason against the nationalist leadership.[^39] The kidnapping of Sukarno and Hatta created lasting tensions between the pemuda generation and the older nationalist leaders, with some viewing the incident as a dangerous precedent for political violence and coercion.

His association with Tan Malaka and the Persatuan Perjuangan in 1946 led to his first major political crisis. The Persatuan Perjuangan's opposition to the Sjahrir government and its rejection of diplomatic negotiations with the Dutch was seen by many as undermining the fragile republic at a critical moment.[^40] His participation in what some viewed as an attempted coup or political destabilization led to his imprisonment from 1950 to 1952.[^41] This period revealed his willingness to prioritize ideological purity over political pragmatism, a trait that would characterize his entire career.

During his tenure in Sukarno's cabinets, Chaerul faced criticism from multiple directions. His Partai Murba's competition with the PKI for influence over workers and youth created intense political rivalries.[^42] In late 1964, as Indonesia experienced severe economic difficulties with hyperinflation and shortages, the PKI singled out Murba Party ministers Adam Malik and Chaerul Saleh as responsible for price increases, mobilizing mass campaigns against them.[^43] The tensions escalated dramatically in December 1964 when Chaerul Saleh publicly claimed at a cabinet session that the PKI was preparing a coup against President Sukarno.[^44] He released a document alleging PKI plans to seize power, an accusation that infuriated the Communist Party and its supporters.

The PKI, at the height of its power with approximately three million members, demanded that Sukarno ban the Murba Party.[^45] Sukarno complied in early 1965, dissolving Partai Murba and leaving Chaerul politically isolated despite his government positions.[^46] This demonstrated the limits of his power and Sukarno's willingness to sacrifice even long-time associates to maintain his political balancing act between the army, the PKI, and nationalist groups.

Following the failed September 30th Movement (G30S) in 1965, which resulted in the killing of six army generals, Chaerul Saleh found himself in an impossible position.[^47] Despite his well-documented anti-communist stance and his public warnings about PKI intentions, the New Order government under General Suharto accused him of involvement in the coup attempt.[^48] On March 11, 1966, when troops surrounded the Presidential Palace, Sukarno fled to Bogor with Subandrio and Chaerul Saleh.[^49] That day, under pressure, Sukarno signed the Supersemar (Surat Perintah Sebelas Maret - Order of March the Eleventh), transferring emergency powers to Suharto.

On March 18, 1966, Suharto announced that fifteen ministers had been taken into custody, including two Deputy Prime Ministers: Subandrio and Chaerul Saleh.[^50] The detention was conducted without judicial process, and Chaerul was never formally charged or tried.[^51] Until his death, there was never an official explanation from the government regarding the reasons for his detention.[^52] The irony was bitter: an anti-communist who had warned about PKI intentions died imprisoned as an alleged communist sympathizer. Many historians view his detention as politically motivated, designed to eliminate Sukarno loyalists regardless of their actual involvement in the G30S events.

## Personal Life

Information about Chaerul Saleh's personal and family life remains remarkably sparse in historical records, reflecting the tendency of Indonesian revolutionary-era biographies to focus on political activities rather than private matters.[^53] Unlike some of his contemporaries whose family lives were well documented, Chaerul's personal relationships, marriage, and any children he may have had are not mentioned in available sources. This absence may reflect both the turbulent nature of his life and the fact that he died as a political prisoner, circumstances that often led to the erasure of personal narratives.

His character, however, emerges clearly from accounts of his political activities. He was known for his boldness and decisiveness, qualities exemplified by his leadership in the Rengasdengklok incident.[^54] Colleagues described him as passionate and ideologically committed, willing to sacrifice personal security for political principles. His decision to join the Persatuan Perjuangan despite the risks, and his later public confrontation with the PKI despite their power, demonstrated a consistent pattern of principled opposition to what he perceived as threats to Indonesia's independence and sovereignty.

The anecdote about his proposal for 17-nautical-mile territorial waters because seventeen was a "sacred number" for Indonesian independence reveals a personality that blended nationalist sentiment with practical governance.[^55] His ability to accept Mochtar Kusumaatmadja's counterargument for 12 nautical miles showed intellectual flexibility and pragmatism beneath his radical reputation. This combination of revolutionary fervor and practical sense characterized his approach to governance.

His time in Germany from 1952 to 1955 demonstrated his intellectual ambitions and organizational abilities. Rather than simply completing his law degree, he took the initiative to organize Indonesian students and establish the PPI, showing his consistent focus on collective action and institution-building.[^56] His choice to return to Indonesia in 1956 rather than remain in comfortable exile in Europe reflected his deep commitment to participating in his nation's development despite the political risks.

The circumstances of his final year reveal the isolation and vulnerability of his position. After the banning of Partai Murba in 1965, he lacked a strong political base beyond his personal relationship with Sukarno.[^57] His detention in March 1966 separated him from whatever family and friends he had, and he spent his final eleven months in custody. He died on February 8, 1967, at age 50, in detention.[^58] The lack of official explanation for his detention, the absence of formal charges or trial, and the silence surrounding his death and burial reflect the brutal efficiency with which the New Order eliminated potential opposition. That he died as a forgotten prisoner, despite his crucial role in Indonesia's independence, represents one of the tragic ironies of revolutionary politics.

## Legacy

Chaerul Saleh's legacy remains contested and complex, reflecting Indonesia's own ambivalent relationship with the revolutionary generation and the Sukarno era. For decades after his death, the New Order government's narrative marginalized him as a Sukarno loyalist implicated (without evidence) in the 1965 coup attempt.[^59] This official version overshadowed his genuine contributions to Indonesian independence and nation-building, leaving him largely forgotten by younger generations despite his pivotal role in the proclamation of independence.

His most enduring substantive legacy is Indonesia's archipelagic state concept, which he helped initiate in 1957.[^60] The Djuanda Declaration's assertion that waters between Indonesian islands constituted internal waters rather than international seas fundamentally reshaped Indonesia's territorial integrity and eventually influenced international maritime law. When the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) codified the archipelagic state principle in 1982, it validated the vision that Chaerul and his colleagues had championed a quarter-century earlier. This contribution affects Indonesia's sovereignty, resource management, and maritime security to the present day, though Chaerul rarely receives credit for his role in its development.

As one of the Rengasdengklok conspirators, Chaerul represents the radical pemuda tradition that forced the pace of Indonesian independence.[^61] The debate over whether the kidnapping was heroic revolutionary action or dangerous insubordination continues among historians. What remains undeniable is that the incident accelerated the proclamation and ensured it occurred as a genuinely Indonesian initiative rather than a Japanese-managed transition. The Menteng 31 group's militancy, embodied by Chaerul, represented a political force that older nationalist leaders like Sukarno had to accommodate, fundamentally shaping the revolutionary character of Indonesian independence.

His commitment to "national communism" through Partai Murba offered an alternative leftist path that rejected both capitalism and Soviet-style communism.[^62] This ideological position, emphasizing Indonesian nationalism and independence from foreign ideological control, proved influential among intellectuals and youth even after the party's banning. The Murba Party's emphasis on adapting Marxist principles to Indonesian conditions represented a distinctively Indonesian approach to leftist politics, though it was ultimately crushed between the PKI and the military.

Recent years have seen modest rehabilitation of Chaerul Saleh's historical reputation. Scholars examining Indonesia's independence struggle increasingly recognize the decisive role of the pemuda generation, including Chaerul, in forcing the proclamation.[^63] Books such as "Chairul Saleh Tokoh Kontroversial" (Chairul Saleh: A Controversial Figure) by Irna H.N. Hadi Soewito examine his life with more nuance than New Order-era histories allowed.[^64] Popular histories and museum exhibits about the Rengasdengklok incident now present Chaerul and his colleagues as heroes who overcame older leaders' hesitation to seize the revolutionary moment.

Nevertheless, the circumstances of his death cast a long shadow over his legacy. That an independence hero and anti-communist politician died in detention without charges or trial, accused of involvement in a communist coup he had publicly warned against, represents the tragic contradictions of Indonesia's transition from Guided Democracy to the New Order.[^65] His fate exemplifies how revolutionary credentials and genuine contributions could be erased by political convenience during periods of regime change. Many view Chaerul as a hero forgotten by his nation, a "Pahlawan Bangsa yang Mati dalam Penjara" (National Hero Who Died in Prison), as one Indonesian headline described him.[^66]

His legacy challenges Indonesian society to reckon with the unfinished business of the 1965-1966 period, when thousands died and careers were destroyed based on accusations that were never subjected to judicial scrutiny. As Indonesia continues to democratize and confront its authoritarian past, figures like Chaerul Saleh—whose contributions were real but whose downfall was engineered by political machination—demand historical reassessment and rehabilitation.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians who have examined Chaerul Saleh's role in Indonesian independence generally emphasize his decisive contribution at a critical historical moment. Indonesian independence historians recognize him as one of the key pemuda revolutionaries whose bold action made independence possible.[^67] Without the Rengasdengklok incident and the pressure applied by Chaerul and his colleagues, Sukarno and Hatta might have proceeded more cautiously, potentially allowing the return of Allied forces and Dutch colonial administration before independence could be declared. From this perspective, Chaerul's willingness to take dramatic action represents the revolutionary spirit necessary for colonial peoples to seize their freedom.

Experts on maritime law and Indonesian sovereignty recognize Chaerul's pioneering role in developing the archipelagic state concept.[^68] His collaboration with Mochtar Kusumaatmadja in 1957 laid the groundwork for principles that would eventually be incorporated into international law. Legal scholars note that few politicians have such direct influence on concepts that reshape international legal frameworks. The archipelagic state principle fundamentally changed how island nations could claim sovereignty over their waters, benefiting not only Indonesia but also the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and other archipelagic states. This contribution represents strategic thinking about national sovereignty that extended far beyond immediate political concerns.

Defenders of Chaerul emphasize his consistent nationalism and his principled opposition to foreign interference, whether from the Dutch, the Japanese, or Cold War superpowers.[^69] His "national communist" ideology through Partai Murba represented an authentically Indonesian leftism that refused subordination to either Moscow or Washington. In an era when Indonesian politics was increasingly polarized between pro-American and pro-Soviet factions, Chaerul's insistence on Indonesian independence of action represented a third path that prioritized national sovereignty above ideological alignment. This position, while politically costly, demonstrated intellectual integrity and commitment to genuine non-alignment.

Recent scholarship has also highlighted Chaerul's tragic fate as emblematic of the injustices of the 1965-1966 transition period.[^70] Historians examining the mass killings and detentions following the G30S incident note that Chaerul was detained and died without trial despite his well-documented anti-communist positions. His case demonstrates how the New Order used accusations of communist involvement to eliminate political opponents regardless of their actual ideological positions. From this perspective, Chaerul represents the thousands of Indonesians whose lives were destroyed by political accusations unsupported by judicial process. His rehabilitation has become part of broader efforts to achieve historical justice for victims of the 1965-1966 violence.

Nationalist historians emphasize Chaerul's lifelong commitment to Indonesian independence and sovereignty, from his youth activism in the 1940s through his governmental service in the 1950s and 1960s.[^71] They note his willingness to sacrifice personal security for political principles, as demonstrated by his imprisonments in 1946-1952 and his final detention in 1966-1967. His career trajectory—from revolutionary youth to senior statesman—embodies the promise and tragedy of Indonesia's revolutionary generation. Those who knew him describe a passionate nationalist whose dedication to Indonesia never wavered even as political circumstances turned against him.

### Negative Views

Critics of Chaerul Saleh focus on several aspects of his political career and methods. The Rengasdengklok incident, while ultimately contributing to independence, represented a dangerous precedent for political violence and coercion.[^72] By kidnapping the nation's recognized leaders, Chaerul and his colleagues demonstrated willingness to use force against their own side, setting a pattern for military intervention in civilian politics that would haunt Indonesia for decades. Some historians argue that this incident exemplified the pemuda generation's political immaturity and their dangerous belief that revolutionary ends justified extralegal means. The kidnapping could have resulted in Japanese retaliation or internal conflict at a crucial moment, potentially derailing independence entirely.

His involvement with the Persatuan Perjuangan in 1946 and opposition to the Sjahrir government drew criticism for undermining the republic during a vulnerable period.[^73] When Indonesia faced military threats from the returning Dutch and needed international recognition and support, internal political conflicts weakened the government's position. Critics argue that Chaerul's ideological rigidity and opposition to diplomatic compromise represented irresponsible radicalism that endangered the republic's survival. His willingness to challenge the legitimate government, leading to his 1946-1952 imprisonment, suggested that he valued ideological purity over the practical needs of nation-building.

Some critics view Chaerul's political career as characterized by opportunism and inconsistency. He moved between different leftist factions—from the Persatuan Perjuangan to Partai Murba to Sukarno's inner circle—in ways that suggest political calculation rather than principled commitment.[^74] His acceptance of senior government positions under Sukarno's increasingly authoritarian Guided Democracy system contradicted his earlier revolutionary idealism. Critics note that he enjoyed the privileges of high office, including the title of Third Deputy Prime Minister, while Indonesia's economy collapsed and democratic institutions were dismantled. From this perspective, Chaerul represents the revolutionary generation's failure to build the democratic Indonesia they had supposedly fought for.

His confrontation with the PKI in 1964-1965, while demonstrating anti-communist credentials, also contributed to the political polarization that preceded the 1965 violence.[^75] Some historians argue that Chaerul's public accusations of PKI coup planning, while possibly accurate, inflamed tensions and contributed to the climate of suspicion and fear that enabled the subsequent mass killings. His role in the factional conflicts of Sukarno's final years represented the breakdown of political dialogue and compromise that made the violent transition to the New Order possible. Critics suggest that more responsible leadership might have sought to de-escalate rather than intensify political conflicts.

Finally, some scholars view Chaerul as a ultimately minor figure whose historical importance has been exaggerated by nationalist mythmaking about the independence struggle.[^76] They argue that the Rengasdengklok incident's actual impact on the timing of independence remains debatable, and that Sukarno would likely have proclaimed independence within days regardless of the kidnapping. His ministerial positions, while senior in title, did not result in major policy achievements beyond the archipelagic state concept (which was primarily Mochtar Kusumaatmadja's accomplishment). From this critical perspective, Chaerul represents the revolutionary generation's tendency toward dramatic gestures and ideological posturing rather than the patient work of institution-building and governance that newly independent nations require.

## Famous Quotes

Due to the limited documentation of Chaerul Saleh's speeches and the focus of historical sources on his actions rather than his words, specific quotations directly attributed to him are scarce in available historical records. However, his political positions and ideological commitments can be understood through documented statements about his views:

> "Indonesia's independence is a decision of the Indonesian people, not Japan."

This principle, articulated during meetings chaired by Chaerul in August 1945, captured the Menteng 31 group's fundamental position regarding the proclamation of independence. The young revolutionaries insisted that independence must be a sovereign Indonesian act rather than a transfer of power orchestrated by the Japanese.[^77]

> "The proclamation must be declared immediately without any interference from the Japanese authority."

Chaerul and his fellow Menteng 31 members advocated this position in opposition to older nationalist leaders who were willing to work within the framework of the Japanese-sponsored Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence. This disagreement led directly to the Rengasdengklok incident.[^78]

Regarding the archipelagic state concept, Chaerul's initial proposal for 17 nautical miles of territorial waters because "seventeen was a sacred number for Indonesia" demonstrates his characteristic blend of nationalist symbolism with practical policy-making, though he accepted Mochtar Kusumaatmadja's more pragmatic recommendation of 12 miles.[^79]

His public accusations in December 1964 that "the PKI was preparing a coup against the President" represented his willingness to directly confront the most powerful political organization in Indonesia despite the personal risks. This statement, made during a cabinet session, inflamed tensions between Partai Murba and the PKI.[^80]

While these statements and positions are documented in historical sources, the absence of extensive published speeches or writings means that Chaerul Saleh's voice comes to us primarily through his actions and the political positions he championed rather than through eloquent quotations. This reflects both the chaotic circumstances of his political career and the New Order's suppression of materials related to Sukarno loyalists after 1966.
