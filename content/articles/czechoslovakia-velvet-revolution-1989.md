## Summary

In November 1989, Czechoslovakia achieved the seemingly impossible: the overthrow of a communist regime through protest alone, without a single death. Students held candles. Citizens jingled their keys—symbolically "ringing out" the old regime. A playwright who had spent years in prison became president within six weeks. They called it the Velvet Revolution because it was so remarkably soft.[^1]

The revolution began on November 17, 1989, when riot police attacked a peaceful student demonstration in Prague. Instead of crushing dissent, the violence sparked a national awakening. Within days, hundreds of thousands gathered in Wenceslas Square. The Communist Party's leadership resigned. Václav Havel, the dissident playwright who had chronicled his country's moral decay from prison, was elected president on December 29. From brutal crackdown to democratic victory in 42 days.[^2]

The Velvet Revolution became a model for peaceful democratic transition—proof that people power, moral clarity, and nonviolent discipline could defeat even entrenched authoritarian regimes. It was the culmination of decades of dissent, from the Prague Spring to Charter 77, and it showed that the ideas Havel had written about in prison—"living in truth"—could become reality.[^3]

## The Revolution

### November 20-24: The Masses Arrive

**Daily demonstrations grew:**

- November 20: 100,000 in Prague
- November 21: 200,000
- November 22: Over 500,000

## Death Toll

**Zero.**

- Police violence on November 17 injured hundreds
- But no one was killed during the revolution
- The "Velvet" nature was complete

**This distinguished it from:**

- Romania (1,000+ dead)
- China 1989 (hundreds to thousands killed)

**Why nonviolent?**

- Movement disciplined
- Leadership (Havel) committed to nonviolence
- Regime already knew it couldn't survive
- Soviet Union not backing hardliners[^12]
