## Overview

The Scopes Trial (officially *State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes*), commonly known as the "Scopes Monkey Trial," was the most famous court case in the conflict between science and religion. In July 1925, high school teacher John Scopes was charged with violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited teaching evolution in public schools. The trial became a national spectacle, pitting two legendary figures: William Jennings Bryan (three-time presidential candidate, fundamentalist Christian) against Clarence Darrow (famous defense attorney, agnostic). Though Scopes was convicted, the trial is remembered for exposing fundamentalist anti-evolution views to ridicule and marking a turning point in the American debate over science, education, and religion.

## Background

### Evolution and Fundamentalism

**Darwin's Theory:**
Published 1859. By 1920s, widely accepted by scientists but contested by religious conservatives.

**Fundamentalist Movement:**
1920s saw rise of Protestant fundamentalism, opposing modernism, biblical criticism, and evolution.

**William Jennings Bryan:**
Famous politician. Crusaded against teaching evolution, which he believed led to moral decay.

### Butler Act (1925)

**Tennessee Law:**
Made it unlawful to teach "any theory that denies the Story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals."

**Penalty:** Fine of $100-$500

## Setting Up the Case

### ACLU Challenge

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) offered to defend anyone charged under Butler Act.

### Dayton, Tennessee

**Town Leaders:**
Saw opportunity for publicity, economic boost. Recruited local teacher to be defendant.

**John Scopes:**
24-year-old football coach and substitute biology teacher. Agreed to be arrested (unclear if he actually taught evolution).

**May 1925:**
Scopes indicted.

## The Lawyers

### William Jennings Bryan (Prosecution)

**Profile:**
- "The Great Commoner"
- Three-time Democratic presidential nominee
- Former Secretary of State
- Famous orator ("Cross of Gold" speech)
- Fundamentalist Christian; anti-evolution crusader

### Clarence Darrow (Defense)

## The Trial

### July 10-21, 1925

**Location:** Rhea County Courthouse, Dayton

**Media Circus:**
- First trial broadcast live on radio
- 200+ journalists
- Carnival atmosphere (vendors, chimpanzees)
- H.L. Mencken's mocking coverage for *Baltimore Sun*

### Legal Strategy

**Defense Goal:**
Put evolution on trial—call scientists to testify.

**Judge Excluded Expert Testimony:**
Ruled scientific evidence irrelevant to whether Scopes violated law.

---

## Bryan on the Stand

### Dramatic Climax

**July 20:**
Darrow called Bryan as expert witness on the Bible. Bryan agreed.

**Cross-Examination:**
Darrow questioned Bryan on literal interpretation of scripture:
- Did Jonah live in whale?
- Was Eve made from Adam's rib?
- Did Joshua stop the sun (implying Earth stood still)?
- How old is Earth?

**Bryan's Answers:**
Struggled. Admitted some passages might be metaphorical. Appeared foolish.

**Famous Exchange:**
> Darrow: "Do you think the Earth was made in six days?"
> Bryan: "Not six days of 24 hours."

Bryan's credibility with fundamentalists damaged.

## Verdict

### July 21, 1925

**Guilty.**

**Fine:** $100 (minimum)

### Appeal

**Tennessee Supreme Court (1927):**
Overturned conviction on technicality (judge, not jury, set fine). Scopes not retried.

**Butler Act:**
Remained law until 1967.

---

## Aftermath

### Bryan's Death

**July 26, 1925:**
Five days after trial, Bryan died in sleep. Exhaustion, diabetes.

### Public Perception

**Northern/Urban:**
Fundamentalism ridiculed. Mencken's mockery influential.

**South/Rural:**
Bryan honored as defender of faith.

### Evolution Teaching

**Chilling Effect:**
Many textbooks removed or minimized evolution. Anti-evolution laws remained in several states until 1960s.

### *Inherit the Wind*

**1955 Play / 1960 Film:**
Dramatized (fictionalized) trial. Shaped popular memory. Portrayed fundamentalism negatively.

---

## Long-Term Impact

### Science Education

**Sputnik (1957):**
Soviet satellite spurred science education reform. Evolution taught more widely.

**Epperson v. Arkansas (1968):**
Supreme Court struck down anti-evolution laws.

**Edwards v. Aguillard (1987):**
Court rejected "creation science" in schools.

**Kitzmiller v. Dover (2005):**
Court rejected "intelligent design" as creationism.

### Evolution-Creationism Debate

Continues in America:
- Textbook battles
- School board elections
- Political issues

## Legacy

### For Science

Trial highlighted tension between science and religion in public education—still unresolved.

### For Civil Liberties

ACLU gained prominence. Academic freedom debates began.

### For American Culture

Symbolizes urban-rural, secular-religious divides.
