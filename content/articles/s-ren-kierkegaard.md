## Summary

Søren Kierkegaard was a Danish philosopher and theologian considered the father of existentialism. He challenged the established Lutheran Church of Denmark and Hegelian philosophy with his emphasis on individual subjective experience and faith. Works like Fear and Trembling and Either/Or explored the nature of authentic religious commitment. His concept of the 'leap of faith' became central to existentialist and religious thought.
