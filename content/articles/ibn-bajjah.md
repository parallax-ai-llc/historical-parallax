## Summary

Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) was an Andalusian polymath who proposed an alternative to Aristotelian physics, arguing that velocity is proportional to the difference between motive force and resistance. His physics influenced Galileo's later work on motion. He also made contributions to botany, medicine, and music theory.
