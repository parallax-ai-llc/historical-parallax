## Summary

Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (1908-1981), known universally as Hamka, was one of Indonesia's most influential Islamic scholars, prolific writers, and political activists of the 20th century[^1]. A modernist reformer who bridged traditional Islamic scholarship with contemporary thought, Hamka authored over 100 books, including the monumental 30-volume Qur'anic commentary *Tafsir al-Azhar*, and classic novels that critiqued social injustices[^2]. As the founding chairman of Indonesia's Council of Ulema (MUI) and a key figure in the Muhammadiyah movement, he shaped Indonesian Islamic discourse while enduring imprisonment for his opposition to authoritarianism[^3]. Posthumously honored as an Indonesian National Hero, Hamka's vision of an enlightened, democratic Islam continues to resonate throughout Southeast Asia[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Hamka was born on February 17, 1908, in Sungai Batang, Maninjau, West Sumatra, as the eldest of four siblings[^5]. His father, Abdul Karim Amrullah (known as "Haji Rasul"), was a prominent Islamic reformer and clerical leader in Minangkabau, while his mother, Sitti Shafiyah, descended from a lineage of Minangkabau artists[^6]. This dual heritage—combining religious orthodoxy with cultural creativity—would profoundly influence Hamka's intellectual development. When Hamka was only four years old, the family moved to Padang Panjang, where he began learning to read the Qur'an and perform prayers under the guidance of his half-sister Fatimah[^7].

The young Hamka's education was disrupted when his parents divorced when he was 12, a traumatic event stemming from tensions between his father's strict Islamic reformism and his mother's family's adherence to traditional Minangkabau practices[^8]. During this difficult period, Hamka discovered his passion for reading after learning that his teacher, Zainuddin Labay El Yunusy, had opened a book rental library. He devoured literary works published by Balai Pustaka, Chinese stories, and Arabic translations, nurturing an intellectual appetite that would define his life[^9].

At age 15 in 1923, driven by a desire for deeper Islamic knowledge, Hamka made the bold decision to leave home for Java, having learned that Islamic education there was far more advanced in structure and organization[^10]. He departed secretly, saying goodbye only to his grandmother in Maninjau, not his father. Arriving in Yogyakarta, Hamka studied under influential figures including Bagoes Hadikoesoemo, Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto, Abdul Rozak Fachruddin, and Suryopranoto[^11]. Under Bagoes Hadikoesoemo's mentorship, Hamka joined Sarekat Islam and was exposed to the nationalist and reformist currents reshaping Indonesian society. This period of wandering and learning in Java fundamentally shaped his intellectual framework, exposing him to diverse Islamic interpretations and the political ferment of the independence movement.

## Rise to Power

Hamka's ascent to prominence began in the mid-1920s when he initiated his journalistic endeavors in Minangkabau, aligning with Muhammadiyah's reformist currents to challenge entrenched *adat* (customary) practices that diverged from Islamic orthodoxy[^12]. In 1925, he officially joined Muhammadiyah in West Sumatra, becoming a pillar of the movement with reformist ideas inspired by Muhammad Abduh[^13]. His early writings demonstrated a commitment to purifying Islamic practice while engaging constructively with modernity.

In 1927, Hamka worked as a correspondent for the daily paper *Pelita Andalas*, writing travel reports about his pilgrimage to Mecca[^14]. This hajj experience deepened his understanding of global Islamic discourse and connected him to reform movements centered in Cairo and the Arab world. The following year, he wrote his first story in Minangkabau titled "Si Sabariyah" and was appointed editor of the "Progress Era" (*Kemajuan Zaman*) magazine based on the results of the Muhammadiyah conference in Padang Panjang[^15].

Hamka's literary career accelerated in 1929 when he began publishing works on Islamic history, theology, and ethics, including *Tarikh Abu Bakr Siddiq*, *Minangkabau Adat and Islam*, and *Summary Chronicle of the Islamic Ummah*[^16]. His marriage to Siti Raham on April 5, 1929—funded by the honorarium from writing "Si Sabariyah"—provided personal stability that enabled his prolific output[^17]. At only 21 years old in 1929, he served as a religious teacher in Padang and founded Madrasah Mubalighin, establishing himself as an influential educator[^18].

Throughout the 1930s, Hamka's reputation grew exponentially through his novels and Islamic scholarship. Between 1935 and 1940, he wrote five novels that became immensely popular not only in Indonesia but also in Malaya, where all five were republished after 1960[^19]. His 1938 novel *Tenggelamnya Kapal Van der Wijck* (The Sinking of the Van der Wijck) critiqued discrimination against mixed-race persons and the subservient role of women in Minang society, establishing him as a socially conscious novelist[^20]. That same year, he published *Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah* (Under the Protection of the Ka'bah), another critique of Minang traditions[^21].

In 1933, Hamka returned to Mecca to perform hajj and deepen his Islamic knowledge, studying at the Dar al-Hadith al-Khairiyyah Madrasah[^22]. This second period of study in the Arab world reinforced his credentials as a serious Islamic scholar capable of engaging with international religious discourse. During the Japanese occupation (1942-1945), Hamka's position became more complex. In 1942, he was elected leader of East Sumatra's Muhammadiyah branch, replacing H. Mohammad Said[^23]. He was appointed as a religious adviser to the Japanese in 1944, accepting this position in the belief that the Japanese would grant independence to Indonesia[^24]. However, when Japan surrendered to the Allies, Hamka faced criticism for this collaboration, driving him to return to Minangkabau and join Indonesian guerrillas fighting against the Dutch in December 1945[^25]. The following year, he was elected Chairman of the West Sumatra Muhammadiyah Assembly, holding this position until 1949[^26].

## Major Achievements

Hamka's most enduring achievement is undoubtedly *Tafsir al-Azhar*, his 30-volume Qur'anic exegesis that remains the first comprehensive tafsir written by a Malay scholar in the twentieth century[^27]. Named after the Great Mosque of al-Azhar in Kebayoran Baru, Jakarta, this monumental work employed the *tahlili* (analytic) method, interpreting the Qur'an through the Qur'an itself, hadith, and the opinions of companions and successors[^28]. Remarkably, Hamka wrote significant portions of *Tafsir al-Azhar* while imprisoned for two years and four months under the Sukarno regime[^29]. The work promoted reformative ideas inspired by Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida throughout the Malay region and continues to be used as a reference by Muslims in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and even Patani, Thailand[^30].

Beyond his magnum opus, Hamka's literary output was staggering in its breadth and volume. Between the 1920s and his death in 1981, he penned over 100 books covering novels, short stories, biographies, memoirs, self-help books, travel books, histories, and many studies of Islam[^31]. His philosophical work included *Falsafah Hidup* (Philosophy of Life), which advocated for moderation in Muslim life, balancing reason and revelation, personal ambitions and communal responsibilities, worldly pursuits and the hereafter, and religious laxity and fanaticism[^32]. Hamka demonstrated intellectual openness toward both Muslim and non-Muslim traditions, including the writings of Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, as well as Western thinkers like Karl Marx and Arnold Toynbee[^33].

In the political sphere, Hamka's contributions to Indonesian independence and democratic governance were substantial. He held positions on the regional leadership council of Masyumi, the federation of Islamic organizations that backed the independence struggle, and participated in the Revolutionary Cabinet, coordinating resistance efforts in Sumatra[^34]. During the 1950s, he was nominated as a member of Parliament (DPR) representing the Masyumi Party in 1955, and he was directly involved in the ideological debates in the Constituent Assembly in Bandung from 1956 to 1959[^35]. He began his career as an employee of the Ministry of Religious Affairs in 1950[^36].

Hamka's intellectual contributions earned him international recognition. Al-Azhar University in Cairo and the Malaysian National University both granted him honorary doctorates, while Moestopo University in Jakarta appointed him a Distinguished Professor[^37]. His reformist Sufism sparked intellectual debates as he critiqued traditional and neo-Sufi practices that deviated from prophetic norms, advocating instead for a purified *tasawuf* (mysticism) integrated with *sharia* and rationalism[^38]. For Hamka, Sufism was an authentic philosophy and science of Islam, but he called for "tasawuf moden" (modern Sufism) to replace "tasawuf tradisional" (traditional Sufism), which he believed was blemished with innovations and superstition[^39].

Perhaps his most significant institutional achievement came in 1975 when Hamka was chosen as the founding General Chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI), established on July 26, 1975[^40]. During his tenure from 1975 to 1981, the MUI became the most influential Islamic advisory body in Indonesia, providing religious guidance on social, political, and legal matters[^41]. After the New Order period in 1967, Hamka also became General Editor of the republished *Panji Masyarakat* magazine, using this platform to disseminate his ideas on Islamic reform and social justice[^42].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Hamka's life was marked by significant controversies, particularly his opposition to President Sukarno's government and its communist affiliations. During the rise of communism in Indonesia from 1958 to the 1960s, Hamka openly critiqued the Sukarno regime for aligning with communist interests[^43]. In his *Tafsir al-Azhar*, Hamka contextualized his Qur'anic interpretation as social criticism against Sukarno's administration, arguing that the regime's political policies resonated with Communist interests while being detrimental to Muslims[^44].

As a political activist through the Masyumi Party, Hamka found himself increasingly at odds with Sukarno's authoritarian "Guided Democracy." The Masyumi Party was dissolved by Sukarno in 1960 after supporting the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) rebellion[^45]. Hamka's magazine *Panji Masyarakat* was also shut down by Sukarno because it contained sharp criticism of his government[^46]. Hamka further launched harsh criticisms of Muhammadiyah regarding its attitude and closeness toward Sukarno, which he considered unnatural, particularly after Muhammadiyah gave Sukarno the titles of 'The Faithful Member' and 'The Great Protector' and awarded him an honorary doctorate[^47].

These tensions culminated in Hamka's imprisonment on January 27, 1964, when Sukarno detained him on charges of subversive crimes, specifically accusing him of plotting to assassinate the president by organizing a secret meeting in Tangerang[^48]. Hamka was detained without legal process, an experience that lasted two years and four months until his release in 1966 following the September 30th Movement (G30S), which led to Sukarno's downfall[^49]. Hamka often reflected that he was "saved by God" from the injustice of the Old Order's final days[^50]. Ironically, this period of imprisonment proved intellectually productive, as Hamka used his confinement to write significant portions of *Tafsir al-Azhar*.

Another major controversy emerged in 1962 when Hamka's novel *Tenggelamnya Kapal Van der Wijck* came under fire for alleged plagiarism due to similarities with Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr's French novel *Sous les Tilleuls*[^51]. While Hamka acknowledged being influenced by Egyptian writer Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti (who had adapted Western novels into Arabic), he firmly rejected accusations of plagiarism, arguing that he had adapted themes and structures rather than copied content[^52].

The final controversy of Hamka's life occurred during his chairmanship of MUI. In 1981, the MUI fatwa commission issued a controversial ruling prohibiting Muslims from attending joint Christmas celebrations on March 7, 1981[^53]. This fatwa triggered a strong reaction from Minister of Religious Affairs Lieutenant General (Ret.) H. Alamsjah Ratu Prawiranegara, who opposed the ruling. Rather than compromise his principles or submit to government pressure, Hamka resigned from his position as MUI chairman in May 1981, just months before his death[^54]. This resignation underscored Hamka's consistent stance throughout his life: his commitment to Islamic principles took precedence over political expediency or personal comfort.

## Personal Life

Hamka married Siti Raham on April 5, 1929, when he was 21 years old and she was 15[^55]. The marriage was arranged at the request of Hamka's uncle to bring comfort to his father, who was experiencing difficulties[^56]. Hamka used the honorarium from writing his Minangkabau romance novel "Si Sabariyah" to fund the wedding[^57]. Siti Raham proved to be a devoted and supportive wife, standing by Hamka throughout his career as a Muslim scholar and writer, through various hardships and financial difficulties[^58].

Together, Hamka and Siti Raham had ten children who survived to adulthood: Zaky, Rusydi, Fakhri, Azizah, Irfan, Aliyah, Fathiyah, Hilmi, Afifi, and the youngest, Syakib[^59]. Siti Raham passed away before Hamka, and eight months after her death, Hamka married Hajah Siti Khadijah, a woman from Ceribon, West Java[^60]. During Hamka's final illness, his daughter Azizah helped him perform prayers, demonstrating the close family bonds that sustained him[^61].

Those who knew Hamka described him as a man with a modest personality who maintained firm principles, particularly on religious matters[^62]. Despite his fame and recognition, he remained grounded in his Minangkabau roots while maintaining a cosmopolitan intellectual outlook. Hamka was well-traveled throughout his life, spending time in various Indonesian cities as well as making multiple pilgrimages to Mecca and engaging with Islamic scholars in the Middle East[^63]. His intellectual curiosity was insatiable—he spent much of his time reading books on philosophy, literature, history, and politics, studying both Arab and Western works translated into Arabic[^64].

Hamka's personality reflected his philosophical commitment to moderation. He frequently advocated for a centrist attitude (*wasatiyya*) for the Muslim community, a principle he applied in balancing competing demands and perspectives throughout his life[^65]. His famous quotes reveal a man concerned with substance over superficiality: "If life is merely living, pigs in the forest also live. If work is merely working, monkeys also work," and "Eternal beauty lies in the elegance of one's manners and the height of one's knowledge, not in one's face and clothing"[^66].

## Legacy

Hamka passed away on July 24, 1981, yet his thoughts and contributions remain profoundly influential today[^67]. His vision for a uniquely Indonesian form of Islam—enlightened, liberating, and hopeful—continues to shape how Indonesian Muslims understand their faith and its relationship to modernity, democracy, and social justice[^68]. Hamka advanced Islam as a body of beliefs around which the new nation could form and prosper, embracing science, human agency, social justice, and democracy while arguing that these modern concepts comported with Islam's true teachings[^69].

The Indonesian government recognized Hamka's monumental contributions by posthumously awarding him the Mahaputra Utama Star and, through Presidential Decree Number 113/TK/2011, declaring him a National Hero of Indonesia[^70]. Hamka University (Universitas Hamka) in Jakarta bears his name, ensuring that future generations of Indonesian scholars will study in an institution honoring his legacy[^71]. Beyond Indonesia, Hamka's influence extends throughout the Malay Archipelago—Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and southern Thailand—where he is considered one of the most influential Islamic figures of the modern era[^72].

Hamka's literary legacy is particularly enduring. His novels and short stories, widely accepted by readers and critics, had a significant impact on Indonesian literature and the nationalist movement[^73]. Works like *Tenggelamnya Kapal Van der Wijck* and *Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah* remain classics of Indonesian literature, regularly republished and adapted for film and television. A 2023 biographical film trilogy titled *Hamka & Siti Raham* brought his story to new audiences, demonstrating the continued public fascination with his life[^74].

As one of the few Indonesian original Qur'anic commentators (*mufassir*) to receive acknowledgments from the global Islamic community, Hamka's contributions to the study of the Qur'an, Hadith, Tafsir, and Sufism remain foundational for Indonesian Islamic scholarship[^75]. *Tafsir al-Azhar* continues to be studied in Islamic schools and universities throughout Southeast Asia, offering a model for how Islamic exegesis can engage contemporary social and political concerns while remaining rooted in classical methodology[^76].

Hamka's reformist approach to Sufism also left a lasting impact. His call for "modern Sufism" that rejected superstition and innovation while maintaining authentic spiritual practice created space for Indonesian Muslims to embrace mysticism without abandoning rationalism or orthodoxy[^77]. This synthesis—characteristic of Hamka's entire intellectual project—demonstrated how tradition and modernity, spirituality and reason, local culture and universal principles could be harmonized rather than opposed.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Contemporary scholars overwhelmingly regard Hamka as one of the most significant Muslim intellectuals of twentieth-century Southeast Asia. Researchers note that "Hamka's contributions to the development and progress of Muslims in the 20th century are considered crucial, and his eminence as a great Muslim scholar, writer, leader, and preacher continues to have impact not only in the 20th century but until today"[^78]. His intellectual achievement is characterized by remarkable breadth and depth, making "remarkable contributions to the development of Muslims through his knowledge dissemination and relevantisation activities, having significant impacts on how knowledge should be sourced and approached, systematizing knowledge, and indigenizing it to the local context"[^79].

Hamka's cosmopolitanism and intellectual openness receive particular praise from scholars. James R. Rush's comprehensive study *Hamka's Great Story: A Master Writer's Vision of Islam for Modern Indonesia* describes Hamka as a "synthesiser who melded different Muslim intellectual traditions," with an openness extending to non-Muslim traditions[^80]. Academic research highlights that Hamka "demonstrated intellectual openness and inclusiveness towards a whole range of thoughts and philosophies to develop his own imaginary and vocabulary of reform"[^81]. This cosmopolitan approach allowed him to harmonize streams of Islamic and Western thought in ways that enriched Indonesian Islamic discourse.

Educational theorists appreciate Hamka's progressive pedagogy. Academic research found that "Hamka rejected a traditional teaching approach that relied on mere memorization of knowledge and instead advocated for the cultivation of critical thinking skills among students"[^82]. This emphasis on critical thinking rather than rote learning represented a significant departure from traditional Islamic education and aligned with modernist educational reform movements.

Politically, Hamka is celebrated for his integrity and independence. Scholars note that he "transcended both modernist and traditionalist positions, and was perceived by fellow Muslims as an independent individual who became 'a symbol of freedom and resistance' when he stood up to the government"[^83]. His willingness to endure imprisonment rather than compromise his principles, and his resignation from MUI rather than submit to government interference, exemplify the moral courage that admirers celebrate.

### Negative Views

Critics have questioned aspects of Hamka's political judgments and alliances. His acceptance of a position as religious adviser to the Japanese occupation forces in 1944, even if motivated by nationalist hopes for independence, subjected him to criticism as collaboration with an oppressive regime[^84]. While Hamka later joined guerrilla forces against the Dutch, this earlier decision complicated his nationalist credentials in some observers' eyes.

The plagiarism controversy surrounding *Tenggelamnya Kapal Van der Wijck* and its alleged similarities to works by Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti and ultimately French novelist Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr remained a point of criticism throughout Hamka's life and beyond[^85]. While Hamka acknowledged influence and adaptation rather than plagiarism, critics argued that the extent of similarity went beyond acceptable literary influence, particularly given that he did not initially acknowledge these sources.

Some scholars and political observers criticized Hamka's intense partisanship with the Masyumi Party and his harsh rhetoric against Sukarno's government. While his opposition to authoritarianism and communist influence is generally praised, critics suggest that his political activism sometimes compromised his role as a religious scholar meant to stand above partisan politics. His criticism of Muhammadiyah for accommodating Sukarno, while principled, also contributed to internal tensions within the Islamic movement[^86].

Hamka's controversial MUI fatwa prohibiting Muslims from attending joint Christmas celebrations in 1981 remains debated. While defenders view this as maintaining Islamic distinctiveness and preventing syncretism, critics—including government officials at the time—saw it as unnecessarily divisive in Indonesia's pluralistic society and potentially harmful to interfaith relations[^87]. This controversy raises questions about the appropriate balance between maintaining religious identity and promoting social harmony in a multi-religious nation.

Finally, some contemporary Islamic scholars question whether Hamka's modernist approach to Islam, while progressive for his time, adequately preserved traditional Islamic scholarship's depth and rigor. Critics from both traditionalist and more radical reformist perspectives argue that Hamka's synthesis, while accessible and popular, sometimes oversimplified complex theological and jurisprudential issues in favor of appealing to modern sensibilities.
