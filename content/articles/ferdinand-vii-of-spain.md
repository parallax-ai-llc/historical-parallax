## Summary

Ferdinand VII (1784-1833) served as King of Spain during one of the most turbulent periods in Spanish history, reigning briefly in 1808 and then from 1814 to 1833.[^1] Initially hailed as "El Deseado" (The Desired) during his imprisonment by Napoleon, he became one of Spain's most controversial monarchs upon his return to power.[^2] His restoration of absolutism, suppression of constitutional liberties, and violent persecution of liberals earned him condemnation from historians, with some calling him "the basest king in Spanish history."[^3] Under his reign, Spain lost most of its American empire, setting the stage for decades of political instability and civil war.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ferdinand was born on October 14, 1784, at the royal palace of El Escorial, the eldest surviving son of King Charles IV of Spain and Queen Maria Luisa of Parma.[^5] He was the ninth child born to the royal couple, but only six of their children survived into adulthood, making Ferdinand the heir apparent to the Spanish throne.[^6] His early years were marked by a tense and dysfunctional family environment, as his parents and their controversial chief minister, Manuel de Godoy, largely excluded the young prince from any participation in government and even threatened him with disinheritance.[^7]

Ferdinand's education was supervised initially by the Marquess of Santa Cruz and later by successive tutors, most notably Canon Juan Escoiquiz, a man of considerable ambition who would profoundly influence the prince's development.[^8] As part of his formal education, Prince Ferdinand studied philosophy, grammar, Latin, music, and drawing, the latter taught by the painter Antonio Carnicero.[^9] However, multiple historical sources indicate that Ferdinand's education was woefully inadequate—possibly "one of the worst received by a Spanish monarch."[^10] The young prince reportedly hated studying, spoke little, rarely smiled, and found satisfaction in petty acts of cruelty.[^11]

Canon Escoiquiz played a particularly damaging role during these formative years, deliberately cultivating in Ferdinand a deep-seated hatred for Manuel de Godoy, the royal favorite who wielded enormous power over Charles IV and Queen Maria Luisa.[^12] This resentment would shape Ferdinand's political actions in the crucial years leading up to the Peninsular War. In October 1807, a conspiracy against Godoy was discovered that directly implicated Ferdinand, known as the El Escorial Conspiracy, whose ultimate aim was to force Charles IV's abdication and place Ferdinand on the throne.[^13] Though the plot failed, it demonstrated the young prince's willingness to engage in intrigue against his own parents.

## Rise to Power

Ferdinand's path to the throne was extraordinary, involving popular uprisings, foreign invasion, abdication, and imprisonment. On March 17-19, 1808, the Tumult of Aranjuez erupted in the royal town about 48 kilometers south of Madrid.[^14] This uprising, instigated by Ferdinand's supporters including the Duke of Infantado and coordinated by advisers like Canon Escoiquiz, targeted the deeply unpopular Manuel de Godoy.[^15] Soldiers, peasants, and members of the general public assaulted Godoy's quarters and captured him, forcing King Charles IV to dismiss his favorite minister.[^16] Two days later, the court pressured Charles to abdicate in favor of his son, and Ferdinand was proclaimed King Ferdinand VII on March 19, 1808.[^17]

However, Ferdinand's first reign lasted barely two months. Napoleon Bonaparte, under the false pretense of resolving the succession conflict between father and son, invited both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to Bayonne, France.[^18] There, in what became known as the Abdications of Bayonne (May 5-7, 1808), Napoleon forced both Spanish kings to renounce their claims to the throne.[^19] Ferdinand abdicated on May 6, 1808, and Napoleon subsequently placed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the Spanish throne.[^20] Napoleon kept Ferdinand under guard at the Château de Valençay for the next six years.[^21]

While the Spanish government's upper echelons accepted Joseph Bonaparte's rule, the Spanish people emphatically did not.[^22] Uprisings broke out throughout the country, marking the beginning of the Peninsular War (1808-1814), known in Spain as the Spanish War of Independence.[^23] On August 11, 1808, the Council of Castile invalidated the Bayonne abdications, and on August 24, Ferdinand VII was proclaimed king in absentia in Madrid.[^24] His imprisonment by Napoleon transformed him into a symbol of Spanish resistance and earned him the popular nickname "El Deseado" (The Desired).[^25]

Ferdinand remained imprisoned at Valençay while Spain was ravaged by war. Finally, after Napoleon suffered serious military setbacks on multiple fronts, he agreed to restore Ferdinand to the Spanish throne. On December 11, 1813, the Treaty of Valençay was signed, formally acknowledging Ferdinand VII as King of Spain and providing for his release.[^26] The treaty stipulated the restoration of the 1808 borders, the withdrawal of French troops from Spain, and an armistice between the two nations.[^27] Ferdinand was released and returned to Spain on March 22, 1814, entering through the Catalan town of Figueres.[^28]

## Major Achievements

Ferdinand VII's "achievements" are deeply controversial and primarily consist of his successful restoration and maintenance of absolute monarchical power rather than genuine accomplishments beneficial to Spain. Upon his return to Spain in March 1814, Ferdinand faced a country transformed by six years of war and liberal constitutional government. During his absence, the Cortes of Cádiz had drafted and promulgated the Constitution of 1812, a progressive liberal document that limited royal power, established equality before the law, and created a constitutional monarchy.[^29]

Rather than accept this constitutional framework, Ferdinand executed a carefully planned counter-revolutionary coup. Sixty-nine conservative deputies signed the "Manifesto of the Persians" (Manifiesto de los Persas) encouraging him to restore absolutism.[^30] Within weeks of his return, backed by conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy, Ferdinand abolished the Constitution on May 4, 1814, and arrested many liberal leaders on May 10.[^31] He justified his actions by claiming that the constitution had been made by a Cortes "illegally assembled in his absence, without his consent and without the traditional form."[^32]

Ferdinand's restoration of absolutism represented a complete rejection of the liberal reforms that had emerged during the Napoleonic period. He re-established the traditional monarchical system, closed universities, banned Masonic societies, and restored censorship.[^33] In July 1814, he reconstituted the Spanish Inquisition, which had been abolished by Joseph Bonaparte in 1808 and remained suppressed during the liberal period.[^34] Though Ferdinand would later refrain from fully restoring the Inquisition after 1823, in January 1824 he created the General Police Superintendency, which became a key instrument of repression and assumed many functions previously performed by the Inquisition, particularly book censorship.[^35]

Ferdinand successfully maintained absolute power during his first period of restoration (1814-1820), suppressing liberal opposition and creating an extensive apparatus of political repression. From 1814 to 1833, he suppressed the liberal press, jailing many editors and writers, and persecuted liberals who had to flee into exile to avoid imprisonment or worse.[^36] His government conducted purges of the state administration and army to remove those who had supported the constitutional regime.[^37]

After the brief Liberal Triennium (1820-1823), Ferdinand achieved what he considered his greatest accomplishment: the second restoration of absolutism with foreign military support. Following the French invasion by the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis in 1823, Ferdinand was liberated from constitutional constraints on October 1, 1823.[^38] He immediately broke his oath to uphold the Constitution of Cádiz and declared "null and void all the acts and measures of the liberal government."[^39] The last ten years of his reign, known as the "Ominous Decade" (Década Ominosa, 1823-1833), saw the most severe restoration of absolutism and systematic suppression of any opposition.[^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Ferdinand VII's reign is characterized by numerous controversies and has drawn severe criticism from historians across the political spectrum. His restoration of absolutism and violent persecution of liberals constitute his most significant controversies. After regaining power in 1814, Ferdinand unleashed harsh repression against liberals, many of whom fled into exile.[^41] After the 1823 restoration following the French intervention, "repression was fierce and arbitrary against those who had supported the liberal constitutional government."[^42]

The symbol of Ferdinand's brutal repression was the execution of General Rafael del Riego on November 7, 1823, in the Plaza de la Cebada in Madrid.[^43] Riego, who had led the 1820 liberal revolt and served as president of the Cortes in 1822, was hanged after a show trial, becoming a martyr for liberal causes across Europe.[^44] Another shocking execution was that of Juan Martín Díez, known as "El Empecinado" (The Obstinate), a guerrilla hero of the War of Independence who had fought against Napoleon's forces.[^45] Despite his patriotic service, El Empecinado was hanged on August 19, 1825, after spending over twenty years in prison under inhumane conditions following a sham trial.[^46]

Ferdinand's persecution extended to Freemasons, whom he blamed for the 1820 coup, the Liberal Triennium, and even the loss of Spain's American colonies.[^47] During the Ominous Decade, the anti-Masonic campaign intensified, and members who refused to renounce Freemasonry were hanged.[^48] In November 1823, systematic purges began under Francisco Tadeo Calomarde, Secretary of Grace and Justice, who employed secret methods, reports, and left the accused defenseless.[^49] Some dioceses created "Juntas de la Fe" (Councils of the Faith) that assumed the functions and methods of the Inquisition.[^50]

Ferdinand's decree of "general grace and pardon" on May 11, 1824, under pressure from European powers, proved to be a cruel deception.[^51] The amnesty included so many exceptions that it effectively condemned all those listed, causing many people who thought they were safe to flee Spain after its promulgation.[^52]

Another major controversy was Ferdinand's catastrophic colonial policy. Upon his restoration, he refused to accept the reality of Latin American independence movements and "tried to recover the colonies and restore their traditional obedience to the crown through military force."[^53] Rejecting compromise and reform, Ferdinand sent expeditionary forces to the Americas, including the appointment of General Pablo Morillo as captain-general of Venezuela in August 1814 with an army of 10,000 men, the largest force yet sent to the colonies.[^54] This military approach only served to harden the position of Creole rebels.[^55]

Despite losing most of the empire—by 1824 only Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines remained—Ferdinand "never abandoned the illusion that he could recover Spain's lost colonies" and "died without recognizing their independence."[^56] When Mexico sought independence, Ferdinand refused to recognize it, declared the Mexican constitution "void," declined the Mexican crown, and stated that no European prince could accede to the Mexican throne.[^57] In his closing speech to the Cortes on June 28, 1821, Ferdinand was categorical: "the only option for America was the indivisible unity of the monarchy."[^58]

## Personal Life

Ferdinand VII married four times in his quest to produce a male heir, though he would ultimately fail in this endeavor. In 1802, he married his first cousin, Princess Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily (1784-1806), daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Marie Caroline of Austria.[^59] The marriage was unhappy, and Maria Antonia's two pregnancies in 1804 and 1805 both ended in miscarriages.[^60] She died in 1806 at age 21.

In 1816, Ferdinand married his niece, Maria Isabel of Portugal (1797-1818), daughter of his older sister Carlota Joaquina and King John VI of Portugal.[^61] This marriage produced two daughters: one who lived only five months and another who was stillborn.[^62] Maria Isabel died in 1818, likely from complications related to childbirth.

On October 20, 1819, Ferdinand married Princess Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony (1803-1829) in Madrid.[^63] They had no children together. After Maria Josepha's sudden death on May 19, 1829, the 45-year-old king announced four months later that he would remarry.[^64]

Ferdinand's fourth and final marriage was to Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies (1806-1878), his 22-year-old niece, whom he married on December 12, 1829.[^65] This marriage finally produced surviving children: two daughters, the future Queen Isabella II (born October 10, 1830) and the Infanta Maria Luisa Fernanda (born January 30, 1832), Duchess of Montpensier.[^66]

Ferdinand's personality has been described in consistently negative terms by contemporaries and historians. The young prince reportedly "hated studying, spoke little, rarely smiled" and found "sardonic satisfaction in all kinds of petty acts of cruelty."[^67] As king, he was described as "whimsical and ferocious by turns," changing his ministers every few months.[^68] Historian Stanley G. Payne wrote that Ferdinand was "in many ways the basest king in Spanish history. Cowardly, selfish, grasping, suspicious, and vengeful, D. Fernando seemed almost incapable of any perception of the commonwealth."[^69]

Ferdinand's behavior during the Liberal Triennium revealed his duplicity. While publicly proclaiming himself the "firmest supporter" of the Constitution in his March 10, 1820 manifesto, historians suggest his constitutional commitments were completely insincere, as he was conspiring behind his government's back and encouraging royalist forces to intervene.[^70] This pattern of deception and betrayal characterized his entire reign.

## Legacy

Ferdinand VII died on September 29, 1833, in Madrid, leaving behind a country economically weakened, politically fractured, and on the verge of civil war.[^71] His death immediately triggered the succession crisis he had inadvertently created through the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830. On March 29, 1830, Ferdinand had issued this decree, promulgating his predecessor Charles IV's unpublished 1789 decision to revoke the Salic law of succession, which had denied royal succession to females.[^72] This allowed his daughter Isabella, born in October 1830, to inherit the throne, displacing his brother Don Carlos from the succession.[^73]

When Ferdinand died, his widow Maria Christina became regent for their three-year-old daughter, Queen Isabella II.[^74] Don Carlos denied the validity of the Pragmatic Sanction and claimed the throne for himself, launching the First Carlist War (1833-1840), which began a series of devastating civil conflicts.[^75] The Carlist Wars, fought intermittently from 1833 to 1876, represented a struggle between supporters of Isabella II and the Carlists—followers of Don Carlos and his descendants—who rallied to the cry of "God, Country, and King" and fought for Spanish tradition, legitimism, and Catholicism against liberalism and later republicanism.[^76]

The territorial consequences of Ferdinand's reign were catastrophic for Spain. During his rule, Spain lost almost all its lands in the Americas, which became independent countries.[^77] His shortsighted refusal to negotiate with independence movements or implement reforms meant that Spain forfeited one of the world's great empires through military defeat rather than orderly transition. This loss had profound economic and psychological impacts on Spain, contributing to the country's decline as a major European power.

Ferdinand's political legacy created a deep rift in Spanish society that persisted for generations. He linked his monarchy to counter-revolution and reactionary policies that produced a fundamental division "between his forces on the right and liberals on the left."[^78] Liberals who had been forced into exile during his reign returned after his death and dominated Spanish politics for decades, though Spain remained politically unstable.[^79] The ideological polarization Ferdinand fostered—between absolutism and liberalism, tradition and progress, centralism and regionalism—would plague Spain throughout the 19th century and beyond.

His reign set a precedent for political violence and repression that normalized the use of state terror against political opponents. The executions, imprisonments, and forced exiles of the Ominous Decade created a culture of political vendetta that would characterize Spanish politics for generations. The systematic persecution of liberals, intellectuals, and reformers drove many of Spain's most talented individuals into exile, depriving the country of the human capital necessary for modernization.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Ferdinand VII has few defenders among serious historians, though some conservative Spanish historians have attempted to present him in a more favorable light. Conservative scholars have praised him as "a capable and popular king who struggled to preserve the traditional Spanish way of life" in the face of revolutionary upheaval sweeping Europe.[^80] From this perspective, Ferdinand's defense of absolute monarchy, his support for the Catholic Church, and his resistance to liberal reforms represent principled conservatism rather than despotic reaction.

Some sympathetic accounts acknowledge that "the problems faced by Spain during his reign were so great that even the greatest of rulers would have been hard put to cope with them."[^81] This view emphasizes the extraordinary challenges Ferdinand faced: the devastation of the Peninsular War, economic collapse, the disintegration of the American empire, and the ideological polarization between absolutism and liberalism sweeping Europe. From this perspective, Ferdinand's harsh measures were desperate attempts to maintain order and stability in chaotic circumstances.

His initial popularity as "El Deseado" (The Desired) during his imprisonment demonstrates that he did enjoy genuine popular support in 1808, when he was perceived as a victim of Napoleon's aggression and a symbol of Spanish resistance.[^82] His transformation into a beacon of Spanish resistance during the Peninsular War was not entirely manufactured propaganda but reflected authentic popular sentiment during the struggle against French occupation.[^83]

However, even sympathetic assessments acknowledge Ferdinand's severe limitations and the destructive consequences of his policies. The most charitable interpretation views him as a man of limited abilities overwhelmed by circumstances beyond his control, rather than as an actively malevolent tyrant.

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among historians is deeply negative. Ferdinand VII's reign "is typically criticised by historians, even in his own country."[^84] Liberal historians have attacked him as "a coward and bloody ogre who tried to sweep back the tide of progress."[^85] Some historians regard him as "incompetent, despotic, and short-sighted," a monarch whose personal failings and reactionary policies caused immense harm to Spain.[^86]

The harshest assessment comes from historian Stanley G. Payne, who wrote that Ferdinand was "in many ways the basest king in Spanish history. Cowardly, selfish, grasping, suspicious, and vengeful, D. Fernando seemed almost incapable of any perception of the commonwealth."[^87] This judgment emphasizes not just Ferdinand's failed policies but his profound character defects: his cowardice in repeatedly betraying his oaths and promises, his selfishness in placing personal power above national interest, and his vindictiveness in persecuting former enemies with extraordinary cruelty.

British contemporary observers across the political spectrum—Tories, Whigs, and Radicals alike—depicted Ferdinand as a tyrant, though with differences in tone and focus of their criticism.[^88] All portrayed him as an inept ruler and provided a very negative image of his reign.[^89] This international consensus reflected Ferdinand's isolation within the European diplomatic community, where even fellow conservative monarchs were disturbed by the severity of his repression.

Ferdinand's reputation has scarcely improved with historical distance. Modern scholarship emphasizes his responsibility for Spain's loss of empire, the establishment of a culture of political violence, and the creation of deep ideological divisions that would plague Spain for generations. His rejection of constitutional government and liberal reforms, his violent persecution of political opponents, his dishonesty and repeated betrayals of oaths, and his complete inability to adapt to changing circumstances mark him as one of Europe's most reactionary and destructive 19th-century monarchs.

One historian summarized Ferdinand VII as having "the reputation of being the worst monarch in Spanish history," though noting that "in some respects this is unfair," since the challenges he faced were extraordinary.[^90] Yet even this qualified assessment acknowledges that Ferdinand's personal limitations and policy choices made a difficult situation catastrophically worse. His legacy remains that of a king who presided over imperial collapse, civil war, and national decline—a cautionary tale of how personal inadequacy and ideological rigidity can accelerate national catastrophe.
