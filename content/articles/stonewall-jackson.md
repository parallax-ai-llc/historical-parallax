## Summary

Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson (January 21, 1824 – May 10, 1863) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War and is regarded by military historians as one of the most gifted tactical commanders in U.S. history.[^1] He earned his famous nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, where he stood like a "stone wall" against Union forces.[^2] Jackson's rapid marches through the Shenandoah Valley in 1862 and his audacious flanking maneuvers made him a legendary figure, though his life was cut short when he was accidentally shot by his own men at the Battle of Chancellorsville and died eight days later on May 10, 1863.[^3] A devout Presbyterian who owned enslaved people and fought to preserve the Confederacy, Jackson's legacy remains deeply controversial in modern America.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Thomas Jonathan Jackson was born on January 21, 1824, in Clarksburg, Harrison County, Virginia (now West Virginia), to Julia Beckwith (née Neale) Jackson (1798–1831) and Jonathan Jackson (1790–1826), an attorney.[^5] His childhood was marked by profound tragedy and hardship. When Jackson was just two years old, his father and his older sister Elizabeth died of typhoid fever, leaving the family impoverished.[^6] Widowed at age 28, Julia Jackson was left with extensive debts and supported her children by sewing clothes and teaching in a school.[^7]

In 1830, Julia married attorney Blake Woodson, but died during childbirth a year later, leaving Thomas orphaned at age seven.[^8] The death of his father and the destitution of his mother led to the boy being raised by a bullish uncle on the ancestral Jackson estate near the village of Weston.[^9] Jackson and his sister Laura Ann were sent to live with their half-uncle, Cummins Jackson, who owned a grist mill in Jackson's Mill near present-day Weston in Lewis County in central West Virginia.[^10] A lack of familial love molded Jackson into a shy, reticent, independent, and determined adult.[^11]

Despite having little formal education, the poorly prepared teenager sought and gained an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1842.[^12] He was academically unprepared when he entered, but by applying his immense powers of concentration and formidable memory, he raised his standing each year.[^13] In June 1846, Jackson graduated from West Point, finishing seventeenth in rank of fifty-nine cadets.[^14] His determination to overcome his educational disadvantages would become characteristic of his later military career.

Jackson's upbringing in the mountains of western Virginia gave him an intimate knowledge of the region's terrain, which would prove invaluable during his Shenandoah Valley Campaign.[^15] The hardships of his orphaned childhood instilled in him a fierce independence and self-reliance that shaped his personality and command style throughout his life.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Following his graduation from West Point, Jackson began his United States Army career as a second lieutenant in Company K of the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment.[^17] He served with distinction in the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, participating in the Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Contreras, Chapultepec, and Mexico City.[^18] His conduct at the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847, was particularly noteworthy when he refused what he felt was a "bad order" to withdraw his troops, explaining that withdrawal was more hazardous than continuing his overmatched artillery duel.[^19] His judgment proved correct, and Jackson won renown and promotion to brevet major for his fearless conduct.[^20]

After the Mexican War, Jackson's military career stagnated. In 1851, he resigned his commission and accepted a position as Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Instructor of Artillery Tactics at Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia.[^21] Unfortunately, Major Jackson, as he was known at VMI, was a mediocre teacher who could not effectively convey concepts to cadets.[^22] At VMI, Jackson was not thought of as a good teacher and was considered distinctly odd, having been dubbed "Tom Fool Jackson" by the cadets.[^23] However, while a marginal professor of natural philosophy, Jackson proved to be an excellent instructor of artillery.[^24]

Jackson's rise to prominence came with the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, when he left VMI to join the Confederate forces.[^25] He was initially commissioned as a colonel in the Confederate Army and ordered to command the garrison at Harpers Ferry.[^26] His moment of destiny arrived at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21, 1861, where he earned his immortal nickname. During the battle, Confederate General Bernard Bee rallied his troops by declaring that Jackson was standing like a "stone wall."[^27] Jackson's Virginia brigade stood its ground at Henry House Hill and refused to budge, holding off the Union attack long enough for reinforcements to arrive, which helped the Confederates win the battle.[^28]

Following his performance at First Bull Run, Jackson was promoted to major general and given command of the Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley.[^29] His spring 1862 Valley Campaign would cement his reputation as one of the war's most brilliant tactical commanders, as his 17,000 men marched 646 miles in 48 days and won several minor battles while successfully engaging three Union armies totaling 52,000 men.[^30] Using aggressive tactics and thorough knowledge of the Valley's terrain, Jackson fought and beat several Federal commanders up and down the Valley from late March to early June.[^31] Jackson's reputation for moving his troops so rapidly earned them the nickname "foot cavalry," and he became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy.[^32]

## Major Achievements

Stonewall Jackson's military accomplishments during the Civil War established him as one of history's great tactical commanders. His most celebrated achievement was the 1862 Shenandoah Valley Campaign, where he demonstrated masterful use of terrain, speed, and deception to defeat larger Union forces.[^33] From March to June 1862, Jackson's small army executed a series of rapid marches and surprise attacks that kept three separate Union armies off balance and prevented them from reinforcing the Union's Peninsula Campaign against Richmond.[^34] His victories at Front Royal, Winchester, Cross Keys, and Port Republic not only protected the Shenandoah Valley but also created such alarm in Washington that President Lincoln withheld troops from the Peninsula Campaign.[^35]

Jackson's tactical weapons included hard marches, knowledge of terrain, unexpected assaults, singleness of purpose, heavy attacks concentrated at one point, and self-confidence arising from the belief that God was on his side.[^36] His generalship was marked by elements of speed, maneuver, initiative, and audacity, combined with a singleness of purpose and determination matched by very few and exceeded by none.[^37] The rapid movements that earned his men the nickname "foot cavalry" became a hallmark of his command style.[^38]

At the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas) in August 1862, Jackson executed one of the war's most daring strategic marches. His force covered an astonishing 54 miles in just two days to capture the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction, threatening General John Pope's line of communications with Washington.[^39] Withdrawing to strong concealed defensive positions on Stony Ridge, Jackson withstood repeated Union assaults on August 28-29 while General James Longstreet's wing of Lee's army arrived to deliver the decisive blow.[^40]

Jackson also demonstrated his fighting abilities at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9, 1862, where Banks's Federals, though greatly outnumbered, attacked with much vigor and Jackson was forced to rally his men by personally riding into the heart of the fighting.[^41] When Lee decided to invade the North in the Maryland Campaign, Jackson took Harpers Ferry, then hastened to join the rest of the army at Sharpsburg, Maryland, where his men bore the brunt of the initial attacks on the northern end of the battlefield at Antietam on September 17, 1862.[^42]

Jackson's partnership with General Robert E. Lee was one of the most effective command relationships of the war.[^43] At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Jackson's Second Corps held off a strong Union assault against the right flank of the Confederate line in what became a Confederate victory.[^44] Jackson was in command of the Confederate right when Federal General Ambrose Burnside's rash attack was easily repulsed and crushingly defeated.[^45]

His final and perhaps most brilliant achievement was his flanking attack at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863. On May 2, Jackson led his entire corps on a 12-mile march around the Union right flank, launching a devastating surprise attack in the late afternoon that routed the Union Eleventh Corps.[^46] This audacious maneuver is considered one of the greatest tactical achievements in military history and contributed to what many historians consider Lee's most perfect battle.[^47]

Beyond his tactical brilliance, Jackson was known for his strict discipline and high standards for his officers and men. He believed that "war means fighting" and stated: "The business of the soldier is to fight. Armies are not called out to dig trenches, to throw up breastworks, to live in camps, but to find the enemy and strike him; to invade his country, and do him all possible damage in the shortest possible time."[^48] His maxim on military tactics was: "Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible; and when you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as your men have strength to follow."[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his tactical brilliance, Stonewall Jackson's career and legacy are fraught with significant controversies and criticisms. Most fundamentally, Jackson fought to preserve the institution of slavery and the Confederate cause. He owned enslaved people and largely accepted slavery as a divinely sanctioned institution, with his actions being typical for white slaveowners of his era.[^50] Jackson owned at least seven slaves before the Civil War, including two who had asked him to purchase them after the deaths of their masters, and his wife Anna Morrison brought three slaves to the marriage.[^51][^52]

In 1855, Jackson organized Sunday School classes for enslaved people at the Presbyterian Church in Lexington, which has sometimes been portrayed as evidence of benevolence.[^53] However, modern scholars recognize that Jackson's Sunday school fit seamlessly into a proslavery theology that worked not to undermine slavery but to bolster the institution and make it work according to God's plans.[^54] This program was part of a broader effort of evangelizing pro-slavery theology to enslaved people following Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion.[^55]

Jackson's military performance was inconsistent, particularly during the Seven Days Battles near Richmond in June-July 1862, where he displayed ineffective leadership and delivered an uncharacteristically lethargic performance.[^56] Some historians attribute this to severe lack of sleep after the grueling Valley Campaign and the exhausting march to Richmond, while others have questioned his tactical abilities under different circumstances.[^57] His colleague General Daniel Harvey Hill tersely observed that "Jackson's genius never shone when he was under the command of another."[^58]

Jackson's personality quirks and eccentric behavior created difficulties throughout his career. As a professor at VMI, his cold demeanor and strange quirks made him unpopular among students.[^59] He kept one arm raised while teaching, believing it would hide a nonexistent unevenness in the length of his extremities, and was described as "awkward and uncultured."[^60] Jackson believed one side of his body was heavier than the other and would raise his arm to let the blood run back into his body.[^61] Tales of unconventional habits, such as sucking on lemons, wrapping himself in wet sheets before church services, and refusing pepper to avoid weakening his left leg, grew in the telling, though some historians suggest many eccentricities were exaggerated.[^62]

Jackson's command style created serious friction with his subordinate generals. He was taciturn to a fault, repeatedly putting his forces into difficult situations that could have been avoided by telling his subordinates something about his intentions.[^63] His obsession with secrecy occasionally impeded his subordinate officers' ability to execute his orders, and some chafed under his leadership.[^64] His relationship with General A.P. Hill was particularly contentious—Jackson charged Hill with dereliction of duty eight times during their time together and had him arrested and temporarily relieved of command when Hill questioned Jackson's leadership abilities in front of subordinate officers.[^65][^66]

Jackson was known as the "King of Confederate court martials," demonstrating a rigid and unforgiving approach to military discipline.[^67] He clearly lacked the political skills to function on the level of a Robert E. Lee or Ulysses S. Grant, and his rigidity in dealing with subordinate commanders of high rank had already begun to fray his credibility among certain leaders.[^68] Tactically, Jackson was quite up-and-down, and even in the Valley Campaign, some of his battles were not tactical masterpieces, though his men overcame some of his faults with help from incompetent Union commanders.[^69]

---

## Personal Life

Stonewall Jackson's personal life was marked by deep religious faith, two marriages, and profound personal loss. He was a deacon in the Presbyterian Church and a staunch follower of the Presbyterian faith, specifically what was known as a "blue light Presbyterian," a particularly strict variety with a strong focus on predestination.[^70] Jackson was fanatical in his Presbyterian faith, and it energized his military thought and character.[^71] Theology was the only subject he genuinely enjoyed discussing, and his dispatches invariably credited an "ever-kind Providence."[^72]

A member of his congregation asserted that "it would be difficult to find in the entire Presbyterian Church any other member who disciplined himself so strictly, obeyed what he believed to be the will of God so absolutely, prayed so fervently, or found so much happiness in his religion."[^73] Jackson rigorously emphasized the providence of God, believing that every act in life and in all of human history had been ordained by God for His will and purposes.[^74] He described his daily religious practice: "I have so fixed the habit in my own mind that I never raise a glass of water to my lips without a moment's asking of God's blessing. I never seal a letter without putting a word of prayer under the seal. I never take a letter from the post without a brief sending of my thoughts heavenward."[^75]

Jackson's first wife, Elinor "Ellie" Junkin, lived only fourteen months after their marriage and died in childbirth in 1854.[^76] On July 16, 1857, Jackson married his second wife, Mary Anna Morrison (July 21, 1831 – March 24, 1915), at "Cottage Home," the Lincoln County, North Carolina plantation of the Morrison family.[^77] The couple first met through Morrison's sister Isabella, who was married to D.H. Hill, a faculty member at what's now Washington and Lee University in Lexington.[^78] Mary Anna's father, Robert Hall Morrison, was a Presbyterian preacher and the first president of Davidson College.[^79]

The couple were deeply devoted to one another and had a happy home despite experiencing profound tragedy.[^80] On April 30, 1858, Mary Anna gave birth to a daughter, Mary Graham, who died less than a month later on May 25.[^81] Another daughter, Julia Laura, was born in November 1862, shortly before her father's death, and was named after his mother and sister.[^82] Mary Anna visited her husband at his headquarters in Winchester during the winter of 1861-62, at his winter headquarters at Moss Neck Manor in the spring of 1863, and again at Guinea Station after he was wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville.[^83] She was at Jackson's bedside when he died on May 10, 1863.[^84]

After Jackson's death, Mary Anna never remarried and was known as the "Widow of the Confederacy," living until 1915.[^85] She published "Life and Letters of General Thomas J. Jackson" through Harper and Brothers in 1892, which was republished with additions in 1895 as "Memoirs of Stonewall Jackson by His Widow."[^86] Her writings helped shape the early historical memory of her husband and contributed to his legendary status in the post-war South.

## Legacy

Stonewall Jackson's legacy is among the most contested of any American military figure. His wartime martyrdom contributed significantly to the South's postwar Lost Cause mythology, which posed the question: but for Jackson's death, might not the South have won?[^87] The Lost Cause portrayed Jackson as a military genius, a pious Christian, and a loyal defender of states' rights.[^88] Generations of historians and writers sought to transform him into various archetypes, from an unpredictable "loose cannon" to a near-mythical Christian warrior.[^89]

Jackson's death at the height of his fame ensured his elevation to legendary status in the Confederate pantheon. General Robert E. Lee reportedly said upon learning of Jackson's wounding: "He has lost his left arm, but I have lost my right arm."[^90] Despite their uplifting victory at Chancellorsville, Jackson's death damaged the Confederate Army's morale, and some historians have speculated whether the South might have triumphed in the Civil War had he not been killed.[^91]

For over a century, Jackson was commemorated with monuments throughout the South and beyond. The statue on Richmond's Monument Avenue, erected in 1919, became one of the most prominent Confederate memorials in the United States.[^92] However, in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder in 2020 and the renewed attention to the Black Lives Matter Movement, Confederate monuments including the Jackson statue came under intense scrutiny.[^93] On July 1, 2020, the equestrian statue was removed from Monument Avenue on the mayor's orders, with only the base remaining.[^94]

Similar removals occurred across the country. In Charlottesville, Virginia, a statue gifted to the city in 1921 by philanthropist Paul Goodloe McIntire was removed on July 10, 2021, amid racial justice protests.[^95] In Baltimore, the City Council voted unanimously on August 14, 2017, to remove Jackson monuments along with other Confederate memorials.[^96] At Virginia Military Institute, the statue was removed from the Parade Ground and relocated to VMI's Virginia Museum of the Civil War at New Market.[^97]

Significantly, descendants of Thomas Jackson requested the removal of the Jackson statue as well as all Confederate statues, stating that in their opinion they are overt symbols of racism and white supremacy and recognizing the need to stop commemorating symbols of racial injustice.[^98] However, controversy continues—a bronze statue of Jackson remains on a stone pedestal outside the Virginia State Capitol, with Republicans largely opposed to its removal.[^99]

Modern scholarship has worked to distinguish the actual historical figure from the myth. As one historian noted, "A disparity exists between the historical Jackson and the idealized Jackson."[^100] Burke Davis in 1954 began to separate Thomas Jackson the myth from Thomas Jackson the man, shedding light on some of Jackson's faults as well as his triumphs.[^101] Recent scholarship has focused more attention on Jackson's role as a slaveholder, with 2018 research uncovering new information about the enslaved people Jackson owned and their descendants.[^102]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Military historians widely regard Jackson as one of the most gifted tactical commanders in U.S. history, with his generalship marked by elements of speed, maneuver, initiative, and audacity.[^103] Military historian Bevin Alexander, in his works "Lost Victories: The Military Genius of Stonewall Jackson" and "Such Troops as These," has argued extensively for Jackson's tactical brilliance and suggested that the Confederacy's failure to follow his strategic recommendations cost them victory.[^104][^105]

Scholars particularly praise Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862 as a masterpiece of military maneuver. His ability to use terrain, execute rapid marches, and maintain operational security while defeating superior forces demonstrated exceptional military talent.[^106] His tactical weapons—hard marches, knowledge of terrain, unexpected assaults, singleness of purpose, and concentrated attacks—showed a sophisticated understanding of warfare.[^107]

James I. Robertson's "Stonewall Jackson: The Man, the Soldier, the Legend" (1997), by one of the nation's most distinguished Civil War historians, produced a probing examination of Jackson's life with exhaustive research and remains the standard scholarly biography.[^108] Robertson's work, while acknowledging Jackson's flaws, presents him as a complex figure whose religious faith and military abilities were genuinely extraordinary for his time.

Contemporary observers recognized Jackson's abilities. His partnership with Robert E. Lee created one of the war's most effective command relationships, with Lee relying on Jackson's aggressive instincts to execute bold strategic plans.[^109] Even Union commanders respected his tactical acumen and feared encountering his forces on the battlefield.

Defenders of Jackson's legacy point to his personal integrity, his deep religious convictions, and his devotion to what he believed was his duty. His famous statement that "my religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed" reflected his genuine faith and courage.[^110] His maxim "Duty is ours; consequences are God's" encapsulated his worldview and approach to military service.[^111]

### Negative Views

Critics of Jackson emphasize that his military service was fundamentally in defense of slavery and the Confederate cause. Modern scholars have increasingly focused on Jackson as a slaveholder who accepted slavery as divinely sanctioned and worked to maintain the institution.[^112] His Sunday school for enslaved people, once portrayed as benevolence, is now understood as part of a broader proslavery theology designed to make slavery function according to God's plans rather than to undermine it.[^113]

Historians have noted significant limitations in Jackson's military performance. His sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the Seven Days Battles have been extensively debated, with some historians considering his performance tardy, lethargic, or inept.[^114] While Jackson partisans have defended his reputation, arguing that fatigue from the Valley Campaign was responsible, critics suggest these failures revealed limitations in his abilities under different operational circumstances.[^115]

Jackson's command style created serious problems. His taciturnity and obsession with secrecy repeatedly put his forces into difficult situations that better communication could have avoided.[^116] His rigid approach to discipline and his contentious relationships with subordinate generals like A.P. Hill demonstrated a lack of the political and interpersonal skills necessary for high command.[^117] As one assessment noted, he "clearly lacked the political skills to function on the level of a Robert E. Lee or a Ulysses S. Grant."[^118]

Scholars critical of the Lost Cause mythology have worked to deconstruct the idealized image of Jackson. The Lost Cause portrayed him as a military genius, pious Christian, and defender of states' rights, but modern historians recognize this as romanticized mythology that obscured his role in fighting to preserve slavery.[^119] Recent scholarship reflects a broader trend in Civil War historiography toward examining the lives of enslaved individuals and the centrality of slavery to the Confederate cause.[^120]

The ongoing controversy over Jackson monuments reflects deeper debates about his legacy. The removal of statues from public spaces represents a rejection of commemorating Confederate leaders who fought to preserve slavery and white supremacy.[^121] That Jackson's own descendants have called for removing statues bearing his name, recognizing them as symbols of racism and racial injustice, represents a significant repudiation of earlier commemorative efforts.[^122]
