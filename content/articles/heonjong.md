## Summary

Heonjong (born September 8, 1827; died July 25, 1849) was the 24th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1834 to 1849.[^1] Ascending to the throne at the tender age of 7, he was the **youngest monarch** in Joseon history. His reign was dominated by the fierce power struggle between two rival in-law clans: the **Andong Kim clan** (led by his grandmother Queen Sunwon) and the **Pungyang Jo clan** (led by his mother Queen Sinjeong).[^2] Caught between these titans of **Sedo Politics**, the young king struggled to assert royal authority. His era also saw the intensification of Catholic persecution (Gihae Persecution) and the first ominous appearances of Western ships in Korean waters.[^3]

## The Boy King and the Regents

Heonjong was the grandson of King Sunjo and the son of Crown Prince Hyomyeong (who died young). When his grandfather died in 1834, Heonjong became king at age 7.

- **Regency:** For the first seven years (1834–1841), his grandmother **Queen Sunwon** ruled as regent. As a stalwart of the Andong Kim clan, she used her power to purge rivals and consolidate her family's grip on the government.[^4]

## Clan Rivalry: Andong Kim vs. Pungyang Jo

Even after Heonjong officially assumed direct rule in 1841 (at age 14), real power lay with the in-law families.

- **Pungyang Jo Rise:** To counter the Andong Kims, Heonjong's mother, Queen Sinjeong, promoted her own family, the Pungyang Jo clan. This led to a decade-long tug-of-war for control of government posts.[^5]
- **Gihae Persecution (1839):** The persecution of Catholics was largely a political weapon. The Pungyang Jo clan instigated the crackdown to attack the Andong Kim clan, who were seen as lenient towards Catholicism. During this purge, three French missionaries and thousands of Korean Catholics were executed, including Saint Kim Taegon's father.[^6]

## Reign and Death

Despite his weak position, Heonjong was known to be intelligent and an avid collector of art and calligraphy. He attempted to check the power of the Andong Kims but died too young to effect change.

- **Death:** Heonjong died on **July 25, 1849**, at the age of 21. He left no heir.
- **Succession:** His death marked a crisis. With no direct descendants, the Andong Kim clan (Queen Sunwon) seized the initiative again, selecting the uneducated "Woodcutter Prince" Cheoljong from Ganghwa Island to be the next puppet king, ensuring their continued dominance.[^7]
