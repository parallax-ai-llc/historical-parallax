## Summary

Mehmed VI Vahideddin (1861-1926) was the 36th and final Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from July 4, 1918, until the sultanate's abolition on November 1, 1922.[^1] He ascended to power during the empire's most catastrophic period, presiding over its defeat in World War I and subsequent dismemberment. His controversial cooperation with Allied forces and signing of the punitive Treaty of Sèvres earned him condemnation as a traitor in Turkish nationalist circles, though recent scholarship has offered a more nuanced portrait of a monarch overwhelmed by impossible circumstances.[^2] He died in exile in San Remo, Italy, in 1926, never having acknowledged his deposition.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Mehmed Vahideddin was born on January 14, 1861, at the opulent Dolmabahçe Palace in Constantinople, the imperial capital of the Ottoman Empire.[^4] He was the youngest son of Sultan Abdulmejid I, who ruled the empire during a critical period of reform known as the Tanzimat era. His mother, Gülistû Kadın (also known as Gülistu Hanım), was of Georgian-Abkhazian Circassian origin and held the title of kadınefendi, one of the highest ranks among imperial consorts.[^5]

Tragedy struck early in Vahideddin's life. His father, Sultan Abdulmejid I, died when the boy was merely five months old in June 1861, depriving him of paternal guidance before he could form any memories of his father.[^6] The misfortunes continued when his mother Gülistû Kadın succumbed to a cholera outbreak in 1865, when Vahideddin was only four years old.[^7] Orphaned at such a tender age, he was adopted and raised by Şayeste Hanım (also known as Şâyeste Kadın), another consort of his late father, who became his stepmother and primary caregiver during his formative years.[^8]

The young prince received the traditional Ottoman princely education within the confines of the imperial palace. He had private tutors who instructed him in various disciplines, and he attended lessons at the Fatih Madrasa, a prestigious religious school.[^9] His curriculum focused on Islamic theology, literature, music, calligraphy—particularly the elegant naskh script—and martial arts, reflecting the comprehensive education expected of Ottoman princes.[^10] Mehmed VI demonstrated particular talent in literature, music, and calligraphy, artistic pursuits that were highly valued in Ottoman court culture and would remain lifelong interests.[^11]

At age sixteen, in approximately 1877, Vahideddin asserted his independence by leaving his stepmother's mansion with three servants, seeking to establish his own household and escape her guardianship.[^12] This move reflected both the typical Ottoman practice of adult princes maintaining separate residences and perhaps a personal desire for autonomy after years under Şayeste Hanım's care. As a younger prince with little prospect of ascending to the throne—given the number of older male relatives ahead of him in the line of succession—Vahideddin spent decades in relative obscurity, observing the empire's turbulent politics from the sidelines with little experience in actual statecraft or governance.[^13]

## Rise to Power

For most of his adult life, Mehmed Vahideddin remained a peripheral figure in Ottoman politics, overshadowed by more senior princes and excluded from meaningful participation in state affairs. This changed dramatically in 1916 when he became heir to the throne (veliaht) following the death of Şehzade Yusuf İzzeddin, making him the eldest male member of the House of Osman and next in line for the sultanate.[^14] His sudden elevation to heir apparent came at a particularly turbulent moment, with the Ottoman Empire deeply embroiled in World War I alongside the Central Powers.

During 1916 and 1917, Crown Prince Vahideddin made official state visits to Germany and Austria-Hungary, the empire's wartime allies, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Mustafa Kemal Pasha—the future founder of the Turkish Republic, who would later become his greatest adversary.[^15] These diplomatic missions exposed Vahideddin to the realities of modern warfare and the desperate situation facing the Central Powers, though they also reinforced his belief in the importance of Great Power patronage for Ottoman survival.

The moment of succession arrived on July 4, 1918, when Sultan Mehmed V Reşad died after a decade-long reign.[^16] However, Vahideddin's acceptance of the throne was not the smooth, ceremonial affair typical of Ottoman successions. On June 3, 1918, Grand Vizier Talât Pasha called Vahideddin to inform him of Mehmed V's death. Despite being the crown prince and the rightful heir as the eldest male of the Ottoman family, Vahideddin was profoundly shaken by the news and did not immediately accept his entitlement to the throne.[^17] When Talât Pasha, Enver Pasha (the Minister of War and de facto military dictator), and the Sheikh-ul-Islam (the empire's highest religious authority) visited Vahideddin at his palace to formalize his accession, he wavered, suggesting they should focus on his half-brother's funeral arrangements rather than his own enthronement.[^18]

This hesitation reveals much about Vahideddin's character and his awareness of the catastrophic situation he would inherit. After a long night of contemplation, prayer, and fitful sleep, Vahideddin finally informed Talât Pasha during the funeral that he was ready to become sultan.[^19] He was formally enthroned as Mehmed VI on July 4, 1918, becoming the 36th Padishah (emperor) and 115th Islamic Caliph, inheriting both the temporal and spiritual leadership of the Ottoman realm.[^20]

His accession came at possibly the worst moment in Ottoman history. The empire was suffering devastating defeats on multiple fronts in World War I, with Allied forces closing in from all directions. The chaotic circumstances of his reign began immediately, with Turkey facing imminent defeat by the Allied Powers as World War I approached its conclusion.[^21] Clever and perceptive, Mehmed VI attempted to follow the example of his elder half-brother Sultan Abdülhamid II by assuming personal control of the government, seeking to assert his authority during the crisis.[^22] However, he ascended to the throne at age fifty-seven with virtually no experience in statecraft, taking power at the absolute worst possible moment to become an Ottoman sultan.[^23]

## Major Achievements

The reign of Mehmed VI (1918-1922) presents a paradox for historians: it is difficult to identify traditional "achievements" during a period defined almost entirely by crisis management, imperial collapse, and ultimately failure. Unlike his more illustrious predecessors who expanded territories, reformed institutions, or led the empire to military glory, Mehmed VI's primary concern was salvaging what he could from the wreckage of defeat, including his own survival and that of the Ottoman dynasty.[^24]

One action that some revisionist historians cite as potentially significant was his establishment of military tribunals to investigate wartime atrocities. On November 23, 1918, Sultan Mehmed VI created a government commission of inquiry, appointing Hasan Mazhar Bey as chairman to investigate crimes committed during World War I.[^25] On December 16, 1918, he officially established military tribunals investigating the crimes of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the Young Turk political party that had dominated Ottoman politics since 1908 and led the empire into World War I.[^26]

These tribunals, known as the Istanbul trials of 1919-1920, addressed the Armenian genocide and other wartime atrocities. The court ruled that "the crime of mass murder" of Armenians was "organized and carried out by the top leaders of CUP."[^27] Sultan Mehmed VI made a press statement absolving the Ottoman people of collective guilt, stating that the CUP was solely responsible for the war and its excesses, including the Armenian genocide.[^28] In an interview with a British correspondent, he specifically asked that the following statement be published: "The great majority of the nation is entirely innocent of the misdeeds attributed to it. Only a limited number of persons are responsible."[^29]

Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha, acting on the Sultan's authority, officially confessed to massacres against the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire on July 11, 1919.[^30] All those sentenced to death received a fatwa from the Sheikh al-Islam in Mehmed VI's name before their execution, lending religious legitimacy to the proceedings.[^31] In establishing these courts-martial, the Sultan's government hoped to demonstrate that it was the Ittihadist Party (CUP), not the Turkish nation, that was responsible for the Armenian massacres, thereby potentially mitigating Allied punishment of the empire as a whole.[^32]

However, critics argue these trials were primarily motivated by political considerations—deflecting blame from the monarchy and the Ottoman state to appease Allied demands—rather than genuine commitment to justice. The tribunals were ultimately abandoned, and many convicted individuals either escaped or had their sentences commuted.

Beyond the war crimes tribunals, Mehmed VI's "accomplishments" were largely reactive rather than proactive. An ardent Anglophile, Sultan Vahideddin hoped that a policy of close cooperation with Britain could result in a less harsh peace treaty, though this strategy ultimately proved disastrously unsuccessful.[^33] His chief concern was maintaining his throne, so "his policy was to seek favor with the Allies" at almost any cost.[^34] In his speech for the opening of the new legislative year of parliament, Vahideddin wished for peace along the lines of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, expressing hope for an honorable settlement that would preserve Ottoman dignity.[^35]

Some modern historians, principally championed by Murat Bardakçı, assert that Vahideddin not only provided Mustafa Kemal the resources to coordinate a nationalist resistance against the Allies but actually intended him to do so, though Kemal ultimately chose to oppose his sovereign rather than remain loyal to him.[^36] According to this controversial theory, Mehmed VI was playing a sophisticated double game—publicly cooperating with the Allies while secretly supporting nationalist resistance. However, this interpretation remains highly disputed and is primarily supported by ideological Islamists, such as the poet Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, rather than mainstream historians.[^37]

In reality, Mehmed VI's reign was not characterized by significant achievements or reforms, but rather by failed attempts to preserve the Ottoman dynasty through cooperation with Allied powers, which ultimately proved unsuccessful and hastened the empire's dissolution.[^38]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Mehmed VI's reign generated intense controversy, and his legacy remains deeply contested. In mainstream Turkish historiography, he has been condemned as a traitor, coward, and British collaborator, primarily due to his cooperation with Allied occupation forces after World War I.[^39] His decisions during the empire's final years—driven by desperation to preserve the Ottoman dynasty and his own position—fundamentally alienated him from the emerging Turkish nationalist movement and sealed both his fate and that of the institution he represented.

Determined to ensure the continued survival of the Ottoman dynasty, Mehmed VI cooperated extensively with the Allies in suppressing all nationalist groups following the unconditional surrender and Armistice of Mudros on October 30, 1918.[^40] The Sultan, opposed to all nationalist ideologies and anxious to perpetuate the Ottoman dynasty, acceded to the demands of the Allies, viewing nationalism as a threat to monarchical legitimacy.[^41] He dissolved Parliament on December 21, 1918, and undertook to crush the nationalist movement that was beginning to coalesce in Anatolia.[^42] When Parliament was reconvened and accepted the National Pact (Misak-ı Millî), which articulated Turkish nationalist war aims, the Allies dissolved the assembly and officially occupied Istanbul on March 16, 1920, leading to a complete exodus of officers, intellectuals, and bureaucrats to Ankara.[^43]

On April 11, 1920, Mehmed VI dissolved Parliament again, after which the nationalists established a rival provisional government in Ankara, creating a dual power structure that would define the next two years of Turkish history.[^44] The Sultan and his ministers, particularly Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha, remained submissive to Allied demands, and the Sultan's government cooperated with Britain in shipping parliament's deputies and others to a prison on the British-controlled island of Malta.[^45] This cooperation with foreign occupation forces, imprisoning Turkish patriots on behalf of Britain, became one of the most damaging charges against Mehmed VI in nationalist historiography.

The single most controversial act of Mehmed VI's reign was signing the Treaty of Sèvres on August 10, 1920.[^46] This punitive peace treaty would have partitioned the empire, leaving the remainder of the country without meaningful sovereignty and reducing Ottoman territory to little more than a rump state in central Anatolia.[^47] The treaty awarded vast territories to Greece, Armenia, France, and Italy, placed the Turkish Straits under international control, imposed severe military restrictions, and established zones of economic influence that would have effectively colonized what remained of Turkey. Mehmed VI's signing of this humiliating document sparked the fury of nationalists under Mustafa Kemal Pasha's leadership and served to strengthen the nationalist cause rather than appease the Allies.[^48]

Mehmed VI's preoccupation with his own survival made him indifferent toward the concerns and needs of his people, who would have suffered far greater hardship than he would from the punitive terms of the treaty he endorsed.[^49] Turkish nationalists strongly objected to his acceptance of the peace treaty and submission to Allied authority, viewing these actions as treasonous.[^50] Under pressure from the British, fatwas (religious legal opinions) were issued declaring that the nationalists were "infidels," that killing them was "obligatory," and that defection from Istanbul to join the nationalist movement was punishable by death.[^51] Mehmed VI personally condemned the nationalist leaders as infidels and called for their execution.[^52]

The Indian Muslim writer Mawlana Abul Kalam accused Vahideddin of being used by the British to sow discord among Muslims by sentencing Kemalist heroes to death while they were fighting to save their nation from foreign occupation.[^53] Unfortunately, like many previous sultans, Mehmed VI was aloof, isolated, and out of touch with the people he ruled, unable to grasp the depth of popular support for the nationalist movement.[^54]

During the Paris Peace Conference, Mehmed VI relied on Damat Ferid Pasha to outflank Greek territorial demands on Turkey diplomatically through Allied appeasement, but these efforts proved completely unsuccessful.[^55] His belief that British grace could save Turkey—that cooperation with the victorious Allies would earn their gratitude and protection—proved to be a catastrophic miscalculation.[^56] Despite being extremely nervous, he expressed his ideas comfortably, but his weakness, timidity, and caution prevented him from turning the throne into a strong element of resistance.[^57]

Deputies in the Grand National Assembly viewed the sultanate as having collaborated with Allied occupation forces by signing the Armistice of Mudros in 1918 and the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920—actions deemed treasonous that forfeited the dynasty's legitimacy.[^58] The nationalist opposition suspended parliament, asserted personal rule, and declared the nationalist movement as rebellion, which outraged the burgeoning movement led by Atatürk, which argued that the Sultan and the government—not the Turkish people—were responsible for entering the war, so the people should not be punished.[^59]

## Personal Life

Mehmed VI married five times throughout his lifetime, reflecting the Ottoman practice of polygamy permitted to sultans, though his matrimonial history was relatively modest compared to some of his more prolific predecessors.[^60] His first and chief consort was Nazikeda Kadın, daughter of Prince Hasan Ali Bey Marşan, who was of Abkhazian origin.[^61] Nazikeda held the highest rank among his wives and was his only wife for twenty years, an unusually long period of monogamous marriage for an Ottoman sultan.[^62] The couple had three daughters: Münire Fenire Sultan (born 1888), who tragically died in infancy; Fatma Ulviye Sultan (1892-1967); and Rukiye Sabiha Sultan (1894-1971).[^63]

After two decades with only Nazikeda, Mehmed VI married his second wife, Inşirah Hanım, from 1905 to 1909, though this marriage did not produce children and ended in divorce.[^64] In 1911, he married his third wife, Müveddet Kadın, who was also of Abkhazian origin.[^65] Müveddet gave birth to his only son, Şehzade Mehmed Ertuğrul (1912-1944), who would remain unmarried and childless throughout his life, dying without issue and thus ending Mehmed VI's patrilineal line.[^66] In 1918, the year he ascended to the throne, Mehmed VI married his fourth wife, Nevvare Hanım, who was also of Abkhazian origin.[^67] Finally, on September 1, 1921, during the height of the Turkish War of Independence and just over a year before his deposition, he married Nevzad Hanım, who was of Albanian origin.[^68]

While his daughters Ulviye Sultan and Sabiha Sultan went on to marry and have descendants who survive to this day, his son Şehzade Ertuğrul remained unmarried and childless, meaning Mehmed VI's genetic legacy continues only through his female line.[^69] Fatma Ulviye Sultan married twice and had one daughter, Suade Hümeyra Hanımsultan (also known as Hümeyra Özbaş), born on June 4, 1917, who in turn had children including İsmail Halim Özba (born October 6, 1945).[^70]

According to the testimony of his relatives and employees, Vahideddin possessed an optimistic and patient personality.[^71] He was evidently a kind family man within his palace, warm and caring to his wives and children in the private sphere.[^72] However, outside the palace walls, and especially at official ceremonies, he would stand cold, frowning, and serious, refusing to compliment anyone—a stark contrast to his domestic persona that reflected the ceremonial distance expected of Ottoman sultans.[^73] He attached great importance to religious traditions and customs, maintaining the pious observance expected of the Caliph of Islam.[^74] He would not tolerate rumors, nor would he allow gossip to circulate in his palace, maintaining strict control over the information environment within his household.[^75]

Despite his outward confidence in certain settings, Mehmed VI's character contained fundamental contradictions. He had ideas that he knew how to articulate, but his weakness, timidity, and excessive caution prevented him from turning the throne into a strong element of governance or resistance.[^76] He believed fervently that the grace of England could save Turkey, an Anglophile conviction that ultimately proved to be his greatest political miscalculation.[^77] Despite being extremely nervous by temperament, he could express his ideas comfortably in appropriate settings, suggesting a man aware of his own intellectual capacities but paralyzed by the overwhelming circumstances he faced.[^78]

Mehmed VI was talented in literature, music, and calligraphy—refined artistic pursuits that were valued traditions in his family and among Ottoman elites.[^79] These cultural accomplishments, however, offered little preparation for the brutal political and military realities of governing a collapsing empire in the age of total war and nationalist revolution. The final years of his life in exile revealed his tragic deterioration: the sultan ran out of money, was forced to sell his medals and decorations to survive, and at his death, prescriptions for medicines he could not afford to purchase were found under his pillow.[^80]

## Legacy

Mehmed VI's legacy is inextricably intertwined with the end of an era, marking the transition from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey and symbolizing the death of an imperial system that had endured for over six centuries.[^81] His forced abdication and exile in 1922 prepared the way for the emergence of the Turkish Republic under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's leadership within a year, fundamentally transforming the political, social, and cultural landscape of Turkey and the broader Middle East.[^82]

With the Ottoman Sultanate officially ending on November 1, 1922, Mehmed VI became the last Ottoman Sultan, with the abolition carried out by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey meeting in Ankara.[^83] On November 17, 1922, sixteen days after his deposition, Mehmed VI boarded the British warship HMS Malaya and fled to Malta, departing with approximately £20,000 in personal funds—a substantial sum that would nonetheless prove insufficient for his remaining years.[^84] On October 29, 1923, the Republic of Turkey was formally declared, with Mustafa Kemal Pasha as its first president, ending more than 600 years of Ottoman suzerainty and establishing a secular, nationalist state on radically different principles from those of the empire.[^85]

The sultanate and caliphate, which Mehmed VI had held simultaneously, were separated by the Grand National Assembly. After Mehmed VI's exile, his cousin Abdülmecid II was elected as Caliph on November 19, 1922, inheriting the spiritual title while being stripped of all temporal power.[^86] However, even this vestigial institution was short-lived. On March 3, 1924, on Mustafa Kemal's initiative, the National Assembly abolished the caliphate permanently, and Abdülmecid II was sent into exile along with the remaining members of the Ottoman House, conclusively ending any lingering connection between the new Turkish state and the old imperial dynasty.[^87] This marked the end of an institution that had existed in various forms for over 1,300 years, fundamentally transforming the political landscape of the Muslim world by eliminating its most prominent symbol of religious-political unity.[^88]

Mehmed VI's reign marked the end of the Ottoman Empire and the beginning of a new era in Turkish history, paving the way for Turkey's modernization and integration into the international community as a secular nation-state rather than a multi-ethnic empire claiming universal Islamic leadership.[^89] His legacy had significant implications for the regional balance of power, contributing to the reconfiguration of the Middle East along nationalist rather than imperial or religious lines, with profound consequences that continue to shape the region today.[^90]

Unfortunately, like many previous sultans, Mehmed VI was aloof, isolated, and out of touch with the people he ruled, unable to adapt to the revolutionary changes sweeping through the post-war world.[^91] The complex nature of his legacy reflects both the impossible circumstances he inherited—ascending to power as the empire faced defeat in World War I and almost certain dismemberment—and his controversial choices during the empire's final years, particularly his collaboration with Allied occupation forces and signing of the Treaty of Sèvres.[^92]

Mehmed VI's legacy in modern Turkey has remained moribund and deeply negative for decades.[^93] His government's signing of the Treaty of Sèvres and other actions taken during his reign have led to his condemnation in Turkish history as a traitor, coward, and British collaborator.[^94] However, recent scholarship into his life has painted a more nuanced picture. Historian Murat Bardakçı has asserted that the Sultan was more of a tragic, if incompetent, monarch faced with an incredible crisis rather than a simple villain.[^95] The scholarly debate now centers on whether Mehmed VI was genuinely incompetent and traitorous or simply overwhelmed by circumstances beyond any individual's control during the empire's inevitable collapse.

Mehmed VI died from a blocked artery (heart condition) on May 16, 1926, in San Remo, Italy, at the age of sixty-five, never having acknowledged his deposition.[^96] He died in exile having spent his final years in reduced circumstances, the last seat of his court being the Villa delle Magnolie in San Remo.[^97] His final moments were pathetic: he died penniless and deep in debt, having been forced to sell his medals for survival, with unpurchased medical prescriptions found under his pillow.[^98] On July 3, 1926, Vahideddin was buried in the Suleymaniyye Tekiyye (Tekke) in Damascus, Syria, far from the imperial tombs of his ancestors in Istanbul, a final symbol of his estrangement from the nation and dynasty he had once ruled.[^99]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Recent revisionist scholarship has attempted to rehabilitate Mehmed VI's reputation, arguing for a more sympathetic understanding of his impossible position. The historian Murat Bardakçı has been the principal champion of this interpretation, asserting that Vahideddin was more of a tragic, if incompetent, monarch faced with an incredible crisis rather than the simple traitor depicted in nationalist historiography.[^100] Bardakçı's research suggests that the Sultan's options were severely constrained by military defeat, Allied occupation, and the near-complete collapse of Ottoman state institutions, leaving him with few viable alternatives to cooperation with the victorious powers.

The most controversial element of the revisionist interpretation is the claim that Mehmed VI not only provided Mustafa Kemal the resources to coordinate a nationalist resistance against the Allies but actually intended him to do so as part of a sophisticated strategy.[^101] According to this theory, the Sultan was playing a complex double game: publicly cooperating with the Allies to maintain his position and preserve what he could of the Ottoman state, while secretly supporting or at least tolerating nationalist resistance that might eventually negotiate better terms for Turkey. Proponents argue that Mehmed VI appointed Mustafa Kemal as inspector of the Ninth Army in Anatolia, providing him with the authority and resources to organize resistance, and that this was not accidental but a deliberate strategy.

This interpretation is supported by ideological Islamists, such as the poet Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, who have sought to present Mehmed VI as a pious Muslim leader betrayed by secular nationalists rather than a failed sultan who betrayed his people.[^102] They emphasize his personal piety, his commitment to Islamic principles, and his efforts to preserve the caliphate as a unifying institution for the Muslim world. Some defenders argue that history has been unfairly written by the victors—the Kemalist nationalists who established the republic—and that Mehmed VI's perspective and motivations have been systematically distorted to legitimize the abolition of the sultanate and caliphate.

Sympathetic accounts also emphasize the genuinely horrific circumstances Mehmed VI inherited. He ascended to the throne at age fifty-seven with virtually no experience in governance, at the absolute worst moment in Ottoman history, facing simultaneous military defeat, economic collapse, foreign occupation, and the dissolution of the empire's multi-ethnic structure.[^103] No sultan, however capable, could have preserved the Ottoman Empire under these circumstances. From this perspective, Mehmed VI's cooperation with the Allies was not treasonous collaboration but a realistic acknowledgment of Turkey's military weakness and an attempt to secure the best possible terms for whatever remained of the Ottoman state.

### Negative Views

The dominant historiographical interpretation, particularly within Turkey, views Mehmed VI far less charitably. His government's signing of the Treaty of Sèvres and other actions during his reign have led to his condemnation in Turkish history as a traitor, coward, and British collaborator.[^104] This judgment is not merely nationalist propaganda but reflects genuine concerns about his willingness to subordinate Turkish national interests to the preservation of his personal position and the Ottoman dynasty.

The most damning charge against Mehmed VI is that his chief concern was keeping his throne, and "his policy was to seek favor with the Allies" at virtually any cost, including the acceptance of terms that would have reduced Turkey to little more than a colonial dependency.[^105] He dissolved Parliament on December 21, 1918, and undertook to crush the nationalist movement, viewing Turkish patriots fighting for independence as greater threats than the foreign armies occupying their country.[^106] Under pressure from the British, he authorized fatwas declaring that nationalists were "infidels" whose killing was "obligatory," wielding religious authority against his own people on behalf of foreign occupiers.[^107]

The Indian Muslim writer Mawlana Abul Kalam accused Vahideddin of being used by the British to sow discord among Muslims by sentencing Kemalist heroes to death while they were fighting to save their nation from foreign domination.[^108] This critique is particularly significant because it comes not from secular Turkish nationalists but from a prominent Islamic scholar, undermining claims that opposition to Mehmed VI was purely the product of anti-religious secularism.

Critics emphasize that Mehmed VI was not merely a figurehead but actively cooperated with Allied occupation, going beyond passive acceptance to active collaboration. The Sultan and his ministers remained submissive, and the Sultan's government cooperated with Britain in shipping parliament's deputies and others to a prison on the British-controlled island of Malta, effectively helping foreign powers imprison Turkish patriots.[^109] This collaboration extended to supporting Greek territorial claims in Anatolia and accepting the partition of Turkey under the Treaty of Sèvres, which would have destroyed Turkish sovereignty and left millions of Turks under foreign rule.

Unfortunately, like many previous sultans, Mehmed VI was aloof, isolated, and out of touch with the people he ruled, unable to comprehend the depth of nationalist sentiment or the determination of ordinary Turks to resist foreign occupation regardless of the Sultan's wishes.[^110] His belief that British grace could save Turkey revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of early 20th-century geopolitics and the ruthless imperial calculations of the Allied powers.[^111] His weakness, timidity, and excessive caution prevented him from providing effective leadership during the crisis, while his preoccupation with his own survival made him indifferent toward the concerns and needs of his people.[^112]

Turkish nationalists argued that the Sultan and the government—not the Turkish people—were responsible for entering World War I, and therefore the people should not be punished through acceptance of the Treaty of Sèvres.[^113] This distinction between the Ottoman government and the Turkish nation became foundational to republican ideology, with Mehmed VI cast as the epitome of everything wrong with the old regime: unaccountable, detached from the people, willing to sacrifice national interests for dynastic survival, and ultimately illegitimate because he subordinated himself to foreign powers.

Deputies in the Grand National Assembly viewed the sultanate as having collaborated with Allied occupation forces by signing the Armistice of Mudros in 1918 and the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920—actions deemed treasonous that forfeited the dynasty's legitimacy entirely.[^114] The scholarly debate continues, but the negative assessment remains dominant, viewing Mehmed VI as a failed leader whose choices accelerated the empire's collapse rather than ameliorating it.
