## Summary

The Tigray War was one of the deadliest conflicts of the 21st century—and one of the least covered. Between November 2020 and November 2022, as many as 600,000 people died in Ethiopia's northernmost region, many from a man-made famine that a UN official called "starvation as a weapon of war." Ethiopian federal forces, Eritrean troops, and Amhara militia swept through Tigray, and what followed has been called genocide by multiple independent investigations.[^1]

The war began when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed—a 2019 Nobel Peace Prize laureate—launched what he called a law enforcement operation against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which had long dominated Ethiopian politics before Abiy's rise. What was promised as a quick campaign became a two-year nightmare of ethnic massacres, systematic rape, destruction of farms and hospitals, and total blockade of humanitarian aid.[^2]

The November 2022 Pretoria Agreement ended active hostilities, but the damage was done: a region starved, its people scattered, its culture nearly destroyed. Eritrea, whose troops were accused of some of the worst atrocities, never signed the agreement and remained in parts of Tigray. Accountability has been virtually nonexistent. The war that few saw has left wounds that will take generations to heal—if they ever do.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Tigray and Ethiopian Politics

**The TPLF:**
- Led Ethiopian government 1991-2018
- Coalition called EPRDF
- Dominated politics; development but repression
- From Tigray: 6% of population

**Abiy Ahmed (2018):**
- Reformist prime minister
- Freed prisoners, made peace with Eritrea
- Won Nobel Peace Prize 2019
- But: Dismantled TPLF's power
- Created new Prosperity Party; TPLF refused to join[^4]

### The Path to War

**Tensions:**
- Federal government delayed elections (COVID)
- TPLF held regional elections anyway (September 2020)
- Federal government declared elections illegal
- TPLF called federal government illegitimate

**November 4, 2020:**
- TPLF allegedly attacked federal military base in Tigray
- Abiy ordered military operation
- War began[^5]

### Eritrea's Role

**Why Eritrea joined:**
- TPLF = longtime enemy (1998-2000 war)
- Eritrea's dictator Isaias Afwerki allied with Abiy
- Chance for revenge

**Eritrean forces invaded from north, turning a civil conflict into a regional war.**[^6]

### Humanitarian Situation

**By 2024:**
- Access improved but needs remain
- Displacement ongoing
- Healthcare system destroyed
- Agricultural recovery slow

### Accountability

**As of 2024:**
- No international prosecution
- Ethiopian government dismissed genocide claims
- Transitional justice process stalled
- Eritrea faces no consequences[^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Political:**
- TPLF-federal power struggle
- Ethnic federalism tensions
- Abiy's centralization vs. regional autonomy

**Historical:**
- Decades of ethnic grievances
- Eritrea-Ethiopia rivalry
- TPLF's mixed legacy

### Why So Deadly?

**Famine as weapon:**
- Deliberate aid blockade
- Crop destruction
- Killed more than combat

**Eritrea:**
- No restraint
- Revenge motivation
- Atrocities even by civil war standards

**Media blackout:**
- Communications cut
- Journalists blocked
- World didn't see[^12]

### Comparison

| Conflict | Deaths | International Response |
|----------|--------|------------------------|
| Syria | 500,000+ | Major coverage |
| **Tigray** | **300,000-600,000** | **Limited attention** |
| Yemen | 150,000+ | Significant coverage |

**Tigray was arguably deadlier than Syria during same period—with far less attention.**

### For Africa

- AU mediation eventually worked (Pretoria)
- But: Impunity prevailed
- Eritrea faced no consequences

### International Failure

- UN documentation extensive
- But no intervention
- No ICC referral (yet)
- World watched; world did nothing[^13]
