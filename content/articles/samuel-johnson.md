## Summary

Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), often called Dr. Johnson, was an English writer, lexicographer, and literary critic who made lasting contributions to English literature and language.[^1] He is best known for his groundbreaking *A Dictionary of the English Language* (1755), which remained the pre-eminent English dictionary for over 150 years until the Oxford English Dictionary.[^2] Beyond lexicography, Johnson excelled as an essayist, biographer, poet, and critic, producing influential works including *The Rambler* essays, *Lives of the Poets*, and the philosophical tale *Rasselas*.[^3] His friendship with James Boswell led to one of the finest biographies in English literature, cementing Johnson's reputation as the dominant literary figure of 18th-century England.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Samuel Johnson was born on September 18, 1709, in Lichfield, Staffordshire, England, in the family home above his father Michael Johnson's bookshop.[^5] His mother, Sarah Ford, was 40 years old at the time of his birth.[^6] The infant Johnson faced immediate health challenges—he did not cry at birth, causing concern for his survival.[^7] During his nursing period, he contracted what is believed to have been scrofula (tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands), a serious condition that would mark him for life.[^8]

Upon the recommendation of Sir John Floyer, the young Johnson received the "royal touch" from Queen Anne on March 30, 1712, at St James's Palace, a ritual believed to cure the King's Evil.[^9] However, the ceremony proved ineffective, and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scarring across his face and body.[^10] This early illness also resulted in poor hearing and eyesight, disabilities that would affect him throughout his life.[^11]

Johnson's education began at age three, provided by his mother, who had him memorize and recite passages from the Book of Common Prayer.[^12] At age four, he was sent to a nearby school, and at six was placed under the instruction of a retired shoemaker before being enrolled at Lichfield Grammar School at age seven.[^13] There, he excelled in Latin under his teacher Humphrey Hawkins and was promoted to the upper school at age nine, demonstrating exceptional scholarly aptitude.[^14]

In 1728, Johnson enrolled at Pembroke College, Oxford, where he enjoyed his tutor's instruction and showed great promise.[^15] However, by December, he was already a quarter behind in his student fees.[^16] After spending only 13 months at Oxford, lack of funds forced him to return to Lichfield without a degree in 1729, a disappointment that would haunt him until Oxford awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1755.[^17] Following his departure from Oxford, Johnson sank into a deep two-year depression, experiencing despair and an inability to act.[^18]

## Rise to Power

Johnson's father Michael died in December 1731 when Johnson was twenty-two, leaving the family in financial difficulty.[^19] During this period, Johnson remained with his close friend Harry Porter during a terminal illness that ended in Porter's death on September 3, 1734.[^20] Some months later, Johnson began courting Porter's widow, Elizabeth (née Jervis), known as "Tetty," who was 45 years old with three children.[^21] Despite the disapproval of the Porter family, partly due to the age difference—Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 46—they married on July 9, 1735, at St Werburgh's Church in Derby.[^22] Elizabeth's son Jervis was so disgusted by the match that he severed all relations with his mother.[^23]

With Tetty's substantial savings, Johnson opened a school at Edial Hall in 1735, but it failed within months due to a lack of pupils.[^24] Among his few students was David Garrick, who would later become a star of the London stage.[^25] In 1737, with his educational venture in ruins and feeling guilty about living on his wife's money, Johnson took Garrick and walked to London to seek fame and fortune as a writer.[^26]

In London, Johnson began writing for *The Gentleman's Magazine*, producing essays, poetry, and parliamentary reports.[^27] Poverty and illness followed him for much of this early period.[^28] His first important literary work, the poem *London*, was published anonymously in 1738 and established his reputation as a talented poet.[^29] In 1746, a group of London publishers approached Johnson with an ambitious proposal: to create an authoritative dictionary of the English language.[^30] Johnson accepted the commission and began what would become his most famous achievement, undertaking the massive project that he initially claimed he could complete in three years but which ultimately took seven.[^31]

The publication of *A Dictionary of the English Language* in 1755 transformed Johnson from a struggling writer into England's foremost man of letters.[^32] The dictionary contained a 42,773-word list and was remarkable for Johnson's innovation of illustrating word meanings with approximately 114,000 literary quotations from authors including Shakespeare, Milton, and Dryden.[^33] He accomplished this monumental work single-handedly, with only clerical assistance to copy the illustrative quotations.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Samuel Johnson's literary accomplishments span multiple genres and establish him as one of the most versatile writers in English literature. His Dictionary alone would have secured his reputation, but his achievements extended far beyond lexicography.[^35]

**A Dictionary of the English Language (1755)** stands as Johnson's crowning achievement in scholarship. It is among the most influential dictionaries in the history of the English language and remained the pre-eminent English dictionary for 173 years until the Oxford English Dictionary.[^36] Johnson's accomplishment was to provide for the English language a dictionary that incorporated with skill and intellectual power the prevailing ideals and resources and the best available techniques of European lexicography.[^37] His innovative use of literary quotations to illustrate word meanings set a new standard for lexicography and demonstrated the richness of English literary heritage.[^38]

**The Rambler (1750-1752)** was a twopenny sheet issued twice weekly in London, containing 208 periodical essays, all but four written by Johnson.[^39] Unlike the more entertaining styles of earlier periodical essays such as *The Spectator* and *The Tatler*, Johnson approached his work with the intent of being a moral teacher, focusing on the complexities of human nature and the futility of human desires.[^40] Though *The Rambler* did not sell well as a periodical, it was an immense success after being reissued in volume form in 1753, with ten printings before Johnson's death.[^41]

**The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia (1759)** was written during the evenings of a single week to pay for his mother's funeral.[^42] This allegorical fable explores the futility of the pursuit of happiness, presenting the journey of Rasselas and his companions in search of "the choice of life."[^43] The work's charm lies in its wise and humane examination of humanity's constant search for happiness.[^44]

**Edition of Shakespeare (1765)** represented Johnson's contribution to Shakespearean scholarship. Published after years of labor, this edition included a famous preface that established important principles of literary criticism.[^45] While Johnson criticized some aspects of Shakespeare's work, including his use of wordplay and departure from neoclassical standards, the edition helped establish Shakespeare's canonical status.[^46]

**Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets (1779-1781)** secured Johnson's fame as a literary critic and biographer.[^47] When London booksellers approached him in 1777 to write what he thought would be "little Lives, and little Prefaces," the project expanded significantly, with Johnson's prefaces alone filling the first ten volumes.[^48] Major lives include those of Abraham Cowley, John Milton, John Dryden, Joseph Addison, and Alexander Pope.[^49] This work established foundational approaches to literary biography and criticism that influenced generations of scholars.[^50]

**Literary Criticism** Johnson was increasingly seen after his death to have had a lasting effect on literary criticism, with some claiming him to be the one truly great critic of English literature.[^51] Critic Yvor Winters declared that "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson."[^52] His philosophical insistence that language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.[^53]

In 1762, Johnson was granted a royal pension of £300 per year for life in recognition of his literary achievements, providing him financial security for his remaining years.[^54] In 1775, Oxford bestowed upon him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law by diploma, and Trinity College Dublin had awarded him an honorary doctorate in laws (LL.D.) in 1765 in recognition of his editing of Shakespeare.[^55]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his literary eminence, Samuel Johnson was a figure of significant controversy, particularly regarding his political views and critical judgments. His political stance as a staunch Tory brought him into conflict with Whig opponents and colonial Americans, while his critical opinions sometimes revealed personal prejudices.[^56]

**The American Revolution** provoked Johnson's most controversial political writing. His pamphlet *Taxation No Tyranny* (1775) was a defense of Parliament's Coercive Acts and a response to the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress.[^57] Johnson argued that the colonists had not been denied representation but rather had willingly left the country where they had votes, that England had expended vast sums on the colonies, and that they were rightly required to support the home country.[^58] The tract became notorious in the American colonies, contributing considerably to the caricature of Johnson as an arch-Tory.[^59] Johnson also criticized the American Patriots' proslavery positions and ownership of slaves, once proposing a toast to "the next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies."[^60]

On the evening of April 7, 1775, Johnson made a famous statement: "Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel."[^61] The line was not, as is widely believed, about patriotism in general but rather what Johnson saw as the false use of the term by William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, and his supporters.[^62]

**The Royal Pension Controversy** caused Johnson considerable embarrassment. In 1762, after Lord Wedderburn had applied to Lord Bute (the Prime Minister) on Johnson's behalf, he received a royal pension of 300 pounds a year.[^63] This was particularly awkward because Johnson himself had defined a "pension" in his Dictionary in scathing terms as "an allowance made to any one without an equivalent. In England it is generally understood to mean pay given to a state hireling for treason to his country."[^64] Critics accused Johnson of hypocrisy for accepting what he had once condemned.[^65]

**Views on Scotland** Johnson, like many in England, held hostile views on Scotland and its people. During his journey through Scotland with James Boswell in 1773, Johnson "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism."[^66] His negative comments about Scotland created tension during their travels and were criticized by Scottish readers.[^67]

**Literary Prejudices** As a critic, Johnson exhibited strong prejudices that sometimes limited his appreciation of certain poets. He was suspicious of John Milton's language, particularly his blank verse, which he believed would mislead later poets.[^68] He could not stand the poetic language of Thomas Gray and complained about the overuse of obscure allusion in works like Milton's *Lycidas*.[^69] In his "Preface to Shakespeare," Johnson criticized some of Shakespeare's tragic speeches as bombast and complained that scenes of pathos were marred by "idle conceits."[^70] His dislike of eccentricity, idiosyncrasy, and singularity led him to undervalue poets who employed different stylistic approaches from his own preferences.[^71]

**Caricature as Arch-Conservative** Thomas Babington Macaulay tried to promote the belief that Johnson's political thoughts were nonsensical and the writings of a bigot.[^72] Additionally, it was James Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an "arch-conservative," and it was Boswell who, more than anyone else, determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later.[^73] Johnson's political views actually changed considerably throughout his life—he early admitted to sympathies for the Jacobite cause, but by the reign of George III, he had come to accept the Hanoverian Succession.[^74]

**Personal Behavior** Johnson's mental health struggles and physical tics sometimes made him appear odd or difficult. He was constantly afraid of losing his sanity but kept that anxiety to himself throughout his life.[^75] He possibly suffered from Tourette syndrome and displayed many obsessional-compulsive traits and rituals associated with this condition, including compulsions of "odd movements" that friends described.[^76]

---

## Personal Life

Samuel Johnson's personal life was marked by his marriage to Elizabeth "Tetty" Porter, his struggles with mental and physical health, his deep religious faith, and his membership in London's most distinguished literary circle.[^77]

**Marriage to Elizabeth Porter** Johnson's marriage to Elizabeth Porter, whom he called "Tetty," began on July 9, 1735.[^78] According to William Shaw, a friend and biographer, "the first advances probably proceeded from her, as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations."[^79] Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but the well-to-do widow encouraged him and provided for him with her substantial savings.[^80] Johnson called the marriage "a love-match on both sides," and always recalled her affectionately and with grief, especially on the anniversary of her death.[^81]

However, the marriage had its difficulties. Feeling guilty about living almost entirely on Tetty's money after his school failed, Johnson spent considerable time away from her.[^82] Tetty's health deteriorated over the years, worsened by alcohol and medical opiates.[^83] She died in 1752 at age 63 after suffering from ill health for several years.[^84] Johnson grieved deeply for her loss and spoke of her with affection for the rest of his life.[^85]

**Mental Health and Religious Struggles** Johnson suffered from severe bouts of depression throughout his life. After leaving Oxford in 1729, he sank for two years into a deep depression, experiencing despair and inability to act.[^86] He was constantly afraid of losing his sanity, a fear that tormented him privately.[^87] Johnson was deeply but not necessarily conventionally religious—he struggled within himself most of his life to sustain his belief in God.[^88] After the age of nine and through his adolescence, he stopped going to church, though his religious faith remained central to his identity.[^89]

He was tormented by a fear of death and by a deeper fear that he might, in spite of his best efforts, be so guilty and sinful that he merited damnation.[^90] Beneath that fear was another, even deeper—the fear that God might not exist at all, that death might bring annihilation and the loss of personal identity.[^91] Johnson struggled all his life not so much to overcome these fears as to coexist with them.[^92]

**The Literary Club** In February 1764, Sir Joshua Reynolds founded The Club (later known as the Literary Club) to ease Johnson's depression and isolation.[^93] The original members included Reynolds (painter), Johnson (lexicographer and critic), Edmund Burke (philosopher and politician), Topham Beauclerk, Bennet Langton, Sir John Hawkins, Oliver Goldsmith (writer), Anthony Chamier, and Christopher Nugent.[^94] Initially, the Club met one evening per week at the Turk's Head Inn in Gerrard Street, Soho.[^95] The members represented different fields: Goldsmith represented poetry and light literature, Reynolds the arts, and Burke political eloquence and philosophy.[^96] Even over such a distinguished society, Johnson predominated, and the Club is to this day popularly designated as "Johnson's Club."[^97]

**Friendship with James Boswell** Johnson first met James Boswell on May 16, 1763, in a London bookshop owned by Thomas Davies.[^98] Boswell was twenty-three years old, while Johnson, born in 1709, was already widely celebrated as "Dictionary Johnson."[^99] The two men formed an instant friendship, though their first meeting was less a meeting than a collision.[^100] Due to Johnson being a generation older, there was something of a father/son relationship to their friendship, with the older, wiser Johnson reassuring the younger man on his choices of career and marriage.[^101] During their 21-year friendship, Boswell recorded many of Johnson's sayings and activities using a self-invented form of shorthand.[^102] In 1773, Johnson traveled to Scotland to visit Boswell at home, and the two men took a 12-week tour of the Scottish Highlands and Hebrides, which both turned into bestselling books.[^103]

## Legacy

Samuel Johnson's death on December 13, 1784, marked the end of an era in English letters, but his influence extended far beyond his lifetime. For future generations, Johnson became synonymous with the later 18th century in England, with the period often termed "the Age of Johnson."[^104]

**Lexicographical Impact** Johnson's Dictionary had far-reaching effects on Modern English and remained pre-eminent until the arrival of the Oxford English Dictionary 150 years later.[^105] More than just a reference work, Johnson's dictionary stimulated lexicography, raised the status and interest of the dictionary as a literary and cultural artifact, and generated new genres of dictionary writing.[^106] His innovative use of literary quotations to demonstrate word usage became the standard approach for subsequent dictionaries and helped establish a canon of English literature.[^107]

**Shaping "English Literature"** As a critic and editor, through his Dictionary, his edition of Shakespeare, and his *Lives of the Poets* in particular, Johnson helped invent what we now call "English Literature."[^108] He established which authors and works should be considered canonical and created frameworks for analyzing and appreciating literary texts that remain influential today.[^109] His philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.[^110]

**Biographical Legacy** Boswell eventually worked his notes on Johnson into the massive biography published seven years after Johnson's death. The first edition of Boswell's work appeared on May 16, 1791, in two quarto volumes.[^111] *The Life of Samuel Johnson* is widely regarded as the finest biography ever written in the English language and is often called one of the great literary biographies.[^112] Through Boswell's vivid portrayal, Johnson became not merely a historical figure but a living presence whose personality, wit, and wisdom continue to captivate readers.[^113]

**Influence on Literary Criticism** Johnson had a lasting impact on biography and literary criticism.[^114] A prevailing mode of literary theory in the 20th century drew from his views.[^115] His assessments of English poets have survived as what Matthew Arnold called "natural centres," points of reference to which criticism can repeatedly return.[^116] Though Johnson's criticism rested on the classical foundation of adherence to nature, reason, and truth, as well as moral instruction, what Johnson added was the need for historical contextualization—examining works within their cultural and temporal contexts.[^117]

**Cultural Icon** Johnson was a celebrity during his later years, with activities and the state of his health constantly reported in various journals and newspapers.[^118] His life inspired many biographies beyond Boswell's, and his personality became a cultural touchstone for wit, learning, and moral seriousness.[^119] His most famous portrait, "Blinking Sam" by Joshua Reynolds (circa 1775), depicts a myopic Johnson reading closely, and has become an iconic image of the author-scholar.[^120]

**Burial and Commemoration** Johnson was buried on December 20, 1784, at Westminster Abbey with an inscription that reads: "Samuel Johnson, LL.D. Obiit XIII die Decembris, Anno Domini M.DCC.LXXXIV. Ætatis suœ LXXV."[^121] A wreath is laid on his grave each year on the anniversary of his death.[^122] His birthplace in Lichfield is now the Samuel Johnson Museum, and his London residence at 17 Gough Square operates as Dr Johnson's House, a museum dedicated to his life and work.[^123]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessments of Samuel Johnson have generally grown more appreciative over time, particularly regarding his critical and lexicographical work. In the 19th century, interest in Johnson centered on his personality as depicted in Boswell's biography, while in the 20th century his writings regained their rightful prominence.[^124]

Literary critic Yvor Winters offered perhaps the highest praise, claiming that "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson."[^125] This assessment reflects recognition of Johnson's unique contribution to establishing principles of literary criticism that balance historical context, moral purpose, and aesthetic appreciation.[^126]

George Watson says that Johnson is an unambiguously chronicled pundit and the genuine father of authentic analysis in English.[^127] His critical approach, which combined classical principles with historical contextualization, created frameworks that subsequent critics could build upon.[^128] Johnson's literary criticism represented some of the earliest praise of honesty and originality in fiction that might lead to the discovery of general truths about human nature.[^129]

Johnson's assessments of English poets have proven remarkably durable. Matthew Arnold recognized them as "natural centres," points of reference to which criticism can repeatedly return.[^130] This staying power demonstrates that Johnson's judgments, even when controversial, identified essential qualities in literary works that continue to merit discussion.[^131]

As a lexicographer, Johnson's achievement is universally acknowledged. His accomplishment was to provide for the English language a dictionary that incorporated with skill and intellectual power the prevailing ideals and resources and the best available techniques of European lexicography.[^132] More than a word list, his Dictionary became a literary and cultural artifact that shaped how English-speakers understood their language and its literary heritage.[^133]

Johnson's moral seriousness and intellectual integrity have also earned lasting respect. His struggles with faith, doubt, and depression, rather than diminishing his reputation, have made him a more sympathetic figure who confronted fundamental human questions with honesty and courage.[^134] His opposition to slavery, well before the heyday of the British abolitionist movement, showed moral independence from his Tory political alignment.[^135]

### Negative Views

Despite widespread admiration, Johnson has faced substantial criticism, particularly regarding his political views and critical limitations. Thomas Babington Macaulay in the 19th century tried to promote the belief that Johnson's political thoughts were nonsensical and the writings of a bigot.[^136] This characterization, though oversimplified, points to genuine tensions in Johnson's political writings, particularly his harsh stance toward American colonists in *Taxation No Tyranny*.[^137]

Johnson's critical judgments have been questioned for revealing personal prejudices rather than universal principles. His suspicion of John Milton's blank verse, his dislike of Thomas Gray's poetic language, and his complaints about obscure allusions in *Lycidas* suggest that his critical standards sometimes reflected his own stylistic preferences rather than objective assessment.[^138] Modern scholars note that "many of Johnson's points have become fundamental tenets of modern criticism; others give greater insight into Johnson's prejudices than into Shakespeare's genius."[^139]

His critical philosophy emphasized general effects over particular analysis, leading him to repudiate both microscopic and telescopic methods of criticism.[^140] This approach, while protecting against excessive pedantry, sometimes prevented him from appreciating works that achieved their effects through particularity and idiosyncrasy.[^141] His dislike of eccentricity and singularity meant he undervalued poets who employed different stylistic approaches from those he preferred.[^142]

Johnson's "Preface to Shakespeare" exhibited this tension, blending admiration with skepticism. He critiqued Shakespeare's departure from neoclassical standards, particularly concerning poetic justice, and expressed discontent with the playwright's use of wordplay and coarse language.[^143] He criticized some of Shakespeare's tragic speeches as bombast and complained that scenes of pathos were marred by "idle conceits."[^144] While Johnson ultimately celebrated Shakespeare's genius, his neoclassical standards sometimes blinded him to the playwright's innovations.[^145]

Johnson's views on Scotland exhibited national prejudice. During his 1773 journey through Scotland with Boswell, Johnson "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism" that offended many Scottish readers.[^146] His negative comments about Scottish culture and character revealed limitations in his cosmopolitan outlook.[^147]

Some critics argue that Boswell's biography, while brilliant, created a distorted image of Johnson. It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an "arch-conservative," and it was Boswell who, more than anyone else, determined how Johnson would be seen by later generations.[^148] The real Johnson's political views changed considerably over his lifetime and were more complex than the Tory caricature suggests.[^149]

Finally, Johnson's acceptance of the royal pension after having defined "pension" in his Dictionary as "pay given to a state hireling for treason to his country" struck many as hypocritical.[^150] While Johnson never betrayed his principles in his subsequent writing, the contradiction between his earlier definition and his later acceptance caused embarrassment and provided ammunition for critics.[^151]
