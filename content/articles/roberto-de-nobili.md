## Summary

Roberto de Nobili was an Italian Jesuit missionary who pioneered inculturation in India. He adopted the lifestyle and dress of a Brahmin sannyasi, learned Tamil and Sanskrit, and engaged with Hindu philosophy. He was one of the first Europeans to study Sanskrit texts. His approach to mission provoked controversy within the Catholic Church but opened new possibilities for cross-cultural evangelism.
