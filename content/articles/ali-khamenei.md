## Summary

Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei has served as the Supreme Leader of Iran since 1989, making him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East and one of the most influential figures in the Islamic world. Born on April 19, 1939, in Mashhad, Iran, Khamenei rose from humble origins to become the second Supreme Leader following Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death. As Supreme Leader for over three decades, he holds ultimate authority over Iran's political, military, and religious institutions, controlling the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and directing Iran's regional network of proxy forces known as the "Axis of Resistance."[^1][^2] His leadership has been marked by confrontation with the West, advancement of Iran's nuclear program, suppression of domestic dissent, and efforts to export the Islamic Revolution across the Middle East.

## Early Life and Background

Ali Khamenei was born on April 19, 1939, in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city and a major Shia pilgrimage center.[^3][^4] He was the second son of Sayyed Javad Khamenei, a humble and impoverished Islamic scholar and mujtahid who had been born in Najaf, Iraq, and Khadijeh Mirdamadi.[^5] His father taught all members of the family to lead a simple, humble way of life, values that Khamenei would later project publicly throughout his political career.[^6]

Khamenei's education began at the age of four when he started learning the Quran at a traditional maktab (religious elementary school).[^7] He spent his basic and advanced levels of seminary studies at the hawza (Islamic seminary) of Mashhad under mentors such as Sheikh Hashem Qazvini and Ayatollah Milani.[^8] These early years of religious education laid the foundation for his future role as a leading cleric, though sources note that he was far more involved with politics than religious scholarship compared to traditional senior clerics.[^9]

In 1958, at the age of nineteen, Khamenei settled in Qom, the center of Shia scholarship in Iran, where he attended the classes of Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi and, most significantly, Ruhollah Khomeini.[^10][^11] He studied advanced jurisprudence, legal theory, and philosophy in Qom from 1958 to 1964, attending Khomeini's classes directly.[^12] In 1962, Khamenei joined Khomeini's religious opposition movement against Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran.[^13] This political activism would define the trajectory of his life and lead to repeated arrests and persecution under the Shah's regime.

Khamenei returned to Mashhad in 1964 to help his father, who had developed an eyesight problem, and he resumed attending Ayatollah Milani's sessions until 1970.[^14] From the time of his return to Mashhad, while caring for his parents, he also taught jurisprudence, its principles, and other religious subjects to young seminary and university students.[^15] According to his official website, Khamenei was arrested six times before being exiled for three years during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[^16] These experiences of imprisonment and exile under the Shah's authoritarian rule shaped his worldview and deepened his commitment to revolutionary Islam.

## Rise to Power

Khamenei emerged as a key figure in the Iranian Revolution of 1979, serving as a close confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.[^17] After the revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Shah, Khamenei became a prominent member of the new Islamic Republic, serving on the Revolutionary Council and as deputy minister of defense.[^18] However, his rise to power was dramatically affected by a near-fatal assassination attempt.

On June 27, 1981, while delivering a speech at the Abuzar Mosque in southern Tehran, a bomb placed in a tape recorder on the table before him detonated, gravely wounding Khamenei.[^19][^20] He had just returned from the Iran-Iraq War battlefield where he served as Khomeini's representative on the Supreme Defense Council.[^21] Khamenei was hospitalized for 42 days and suffered permanent hearing loss, lung and vocal cord damage, and permanently lost the use of his right arm.[^22] According to his official website, the assassination was planned by the Mojahedin-e Khalq (People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran).[^23] The paralysis of his right arm remains visible in all subsequent photographs and public appearances.

Despite these severe injuries, Khamenei's political trajectory continued upward. In October 1981, following the assassination of President Mohammad-Ali Rajai, Khamenei was elected President of Iran by a landslide vote of 97%.[^24] He served as the third president of Iran from 1981 to 1989, a tenure that coincided with the brutal Iran-Iraq War.[^25] During his presidency, Khamenei developed close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and had a reputation for being deeply interested in military, budgetary, and administrative details.[^26] However, the presidency was largely a ceremonial role during his two terms, with most executive authority being vested in the prime minister.[^27] After the Iraqi Army was expelled from Iran in 1982, Khamenei became one of the main opponents of the decision to counter-invade Iraq, an opinion he shared with Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi.[^28]

The most significant turning point came in 1989 following Khomeini's death. The Assembly of Experts elected Khamenei as Supreme Leader, despite the fact that he did not meet traditional qualifications for the position.[^29] Khamenei had not yet attained the status of a senior cleric, having been accorded only the title of hojatoleslām rather than the more elevated rank of ayatollah typically required for the Supreme Leadership.[^30] Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a Khomeini confidante who had become the powerful speaker of the Iranian parliament (Majles), played a crucial role in this selection. Rafsanjani, who lived next door to Khomeini and had sat at his deathbed, informed the Council of Experts that Khomeini's last wish had been for Khamenei to succeed him.[^31] Scholars have noted that "there is no case to be made that Khamenei rose to the top out of ambition; clearly he was initially chosen because he was considered a relatively weak figure, not a strong one."[^32] However, Khamenei would spend the following decades systematically consolidating power and transforming the office of Supreme Leader into one of near-absolute authority.

## Major Achievements

As Supreme Leader, Khamenei has stood at the heart of the Islamic Republic since 1979, playing a pivotal role in both the militarization of the state and the consolidation of near-absolute authority in the Office of the Supreme Leader.[^33] His tenure, spanning over 36 years, makes him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East and the longest-serving Iranian leader since Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[^34]

One of Khamenei's most significant achievements has been the development and expansion of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He is widely regarded as the architect of the IRGC's rise, shaping it into a powerful instrument of domestic control and regional influence.[^35] The IRGC has grown from a revolutionary militia into a vast military, economic, and political conglomerate controlling significant portions of Iran's economy, including construction, telecommunications, and energy sectors.[^36] This institutional power base has been crucial to maintaining regime stability and projecting Iranian power abroad.

Khamenei's foreign policy centered on Shia Islamism and exporting the Iranian Revolution has created a regional network unprecedented in modern Middle Eastern history.[^37] The "Axis of Resistance" project is perhaps one of Khamenei's most significant legacies, consisting of an alliance network that includes Syria (until the Assad regime's fall in 2024), Hezbollah in Lebanon, allied factions of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, Yemen's Houthi movement, and Palestinian groups including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.[^38][^39] These regional groups, managed by the IRGC, have extended Iranian influence from the Mediterranean to the Arabian Peninsula. Iran invested between $30 and $50 billion in financial and military support to sustain these alliances, particularly in Syria.[^40]

On the economic front, Khamenei favored economic privatization of state-owned industries and, leveraging Iran's massive oil and gas reserves, sought to transform Iran into an "energy superpower."[^41] However, this objective has been significantly hampered by international sanctions and economic mismanagement.

Regarding Iran's nuclear program, Khamenei encouraged its pursuit while maintaining a complex and often contradictory public posture. He issued a fatwa forbidding the production of weapons of mass destruction, with the first public announcement reported in October 2003.[^42][^43] Despite his skeptical public statements during negotiations, Khamenei ultimately approved the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal.[^44] The JCPOA, concluded between Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union, provided that Iran's nuclear activities would be limited in exchange for reduced sanctions.[^45] However, Khamenei was never enthusiastic about the deal and remained skeptical of the agreement from the start, consistently voicing doubt that the United States would honor its commitments.[^46]

As Supreme Leader for more than three decades, Khamenei has cemented his standing as one of the two most consequential figures in the history of the Islamic Republic in terms of shaping the country's trajectory at home and on the world stage, the other being Khomeini himself.[^47] His leadership has profoundly influenced regional politics through proxy networks, anti-Western ideology, and the consolidation of theocratic power in Iran.[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Khamenei's leadership has been marked by severe controversies, particularly regarding human rights violations and the suppression of democratic movements. The most significant challenge to his authority came with the 2009 Green Movement, which emerged after the disputed June 12, 2009 presidential election.[^49] Up to 3 million peaceful demonstrators protested official claims that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won in a landslide, with allegations of widespread election fraud.[^50] Khamenei's unwavering support for President Ahmadinejad and his decision to respond with brutal repression rather than address the protesters' demands marked a fundamental transformation of the Islamic Republic.[^51]

On June 19, 2009, Khamenei issued a warning that protests must end and that political leaders would be blamed for any violence.[^52] The regime's security forces killed at least 30 protesters in clashes on June 15, with estimates suggesting as many as 150 people were killed and thousands jailed over the following months.[^53] To prevent protests around Ahmadinejad's second inauguration, the regime conducted show trials of over 140 prominent reformist politicians, journalists, academics, and activists on August 1, 2009, with defendants having suffered torture at the hands of Iranian security forces.[^54] A reformist cleric later stated that Khamenei had backed the vote-rigging and crackdown.[^55] During demonstrations, protesters chanted "Death to the dictator" and "Khamenei is a murderer. His rule is null and void," showing how the protests evolved from concerns about election fraud to direct challenges against Khamenei himself.[^56]

More recently, the 2022 protests following the death of Mahsa Amini represented another massive challenge to Khamenei's authority. Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was arrested by Iran's Guidance Patrol (morality police) on September 13, 2022, for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly."[^57] She collapsed, was hospitalized, and died three days later. A UN investigation found that Iran was responsible for the "physical violence" that killed her.[^58] The protests that followed began with the chant "Women, Life, Freedom," but soon evolved into widespread calls for revolt against Khamenei.[^59] Protest slogans included "Death to the Dictator," "Khamenei is a Murderer, an Illegitimate Ruler," and "Death to Khamenei."[^60] These were described as "unlike any the country had seen before," the "biggest challenge" to the government, and the "most widespread revolt" since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.[^61]

The government responded with a months-long crackdown, killing more than 500 people and detaining over 22,000.[^62] A UN report found Iranian security forces used shotguns, assault rifles, and submachine guns against demonstrators "in situations where there was no imminent threat."[^63] As of Spring 2023, seven individuals had been executed in connection with the protests.[^64] Despite this brutal suppression, many Iranian women continue to defy the mandatory hijab requirement, and Khamenei has continued to defend the hijab policy in public addresses.[^65]

Another major controversy involves the wealth accumulated by the Khamenei family. While Khamenei presents himself "as an ascetic, dressing and eating simply," his personal fortune was estimated by Reuters in 2013 to be worth at least $95 billion based on the value of Setad (a vast parastatal holdings firm) alone, with some estimates ranging as high as $200 billion.[^66][^67] His children have accumulated enormous wealth: Mojtaba, his second eldest son, has more than $3 billion; Masoud, his third son, manages many of his father's institutions and holds more than $400 million in banks in France and the UK; Meysam, the youngest son, has accumulated wealth of more than $200 million; and Boshra, his daughter, has wealth estimated at around $100 million.[^68] This concentration of wealth stands in stark contrast to the economic hardships faced by ordinary Iranians and the regime's revolutionary rhetoric against corruption and privilege.

Khamenei's response to the collapse of the Iran nuclear deal has also generated criticism. When President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018, reinstating the "highest level of economic sanction," Khamenei's predictions about American unreliability were vindicated.[^69][^70] He told Iranians in a televised speech: "You heard what worthless things the American president said last night. He lied maybe up to 10 times and he threatened the state and the nation. I tell him on behalf of the Iranian nation: Mr. Trump, you can't do a damned thing!"[^71] Calling Trump's words "cheap and petty," he declared: "We kept saying not to trust the US and here is the result."[^72] However, critics note that Khamenei's inflexible posture and support for hardliners has prevented more pragmatic diplomatic solutions that could have relieved the suffering of ordinary Iranians under sanctions.

Recent geopolitical setbacks have further damaged Khamenei's standing. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 was described by Western media as a crippling blow to the Axis of Resistance, despite Khamenei's denials.[^73] The decimation of Hezbollah and Hamas, and the loss of Syria to Sunni Islamists, have been characterized as significant strategic failures.[^74] Academic analyses suggest that "Khamenei's continuous miscalculations, misjudgments, and consistent U-turns have begun to crack the veneer of his radical cult of personality."[^75]

## Personal Life

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei married Mansoureh Khojasteh Baqer Zadeh in 1964, and the couple has remained married for over six decades.[^76] They have six children—four sons (Mostafa, Mojtaba, Masoud, and Meysam) and two daughters (Boshra and Hoda).[^77] Khamenei has been married only once, which is notable in a cultural context where polygamy is legally permitted.[^78]

Despite his immense political power, Khamenei has cultivated a public image of personal asceticism and simple living, dressing and eating simply according to observers.[^79] This carefully maintained persona echoes the lifestyle of his father, who taught the family to embrace humility and simplicity.[^80] However, this public image has been called into question by revelations about the extraordinary wealth accumulated by his family members and the vast economic empire he controls through Setad and other institutions.[^81]

Khamenei's health has been a subject of speculation and concern, particularly given his advanced age. In January 2007, rumors spread of his illness or death after he had not been seen in public for some weeks.[^82] At 86 years old (as of 2025), Khamenei remains Iran's focal authority, though succession planning has become increasingly urgent.[^83] His right arm remains paralyzed from the 1981 assassination attempt, a permanent physical reminder of the dangers he has faced.[^84]

Among his children, Mojtaba Khamenei has emerged as his most politically influential offspring and is widely regarded as the leading contender to succeed his father as Supreme Leader.[^85] As Mojtaba came of age, Khamenei made him his de facto, if unofficial, chief-of-staff so that he could learn the workings of supreme leadership.[^86] However, the possibility of hereditary succession is highly controversial, as Ayatollah Khomeini had railed against the Shah in part because of the notion of hereditary leadership.[^87] In November 2024, reports emerged that the Assembly of Experts had secretly appointed Mojtaba as successor, though this was later denied by pro-government media.[^88] More recently, the New York Times reported that Mojtaba is not among the candidates Khamenei has selected as possible successors, and that Khamenei himself has voiced disapproval of hereditary succession.[^89][^90]

Khamenei's personality is characterized by sources as deeply ideological, suspicious of the West, and committed to the principles of the Islamic Revolution. A comprehensive doctoral dissertation analyzing 500 of his speeches (1989-2013) and 100 interviews (1981-1989) identified Islamic supremacy, resistance to foreign powers, and progress as the core elements of his ideology.[^91] He continues to proclaim Khomeini's ideals from the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including supremacy of Islam, the isolation policy of "Neither East, Nor West," and enmity with the United States and Israel.[^92]

## Legacy

Ali Khamenei's legacy is one of profound and lasting impact on Iran, the Middle East, and the broader Islamic world, though assessments of that impact vary dramatically depending on perspective. As the longest-serving Iranian leader since Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East, his tenure has shaped an entire generation's understanding of the Islamic Republic.[^93][^94] Whether celebrated or criticized, his role in shaping modern Middle Eastern history is undeniable.[^95]

The "Axis of Resistance" stands as perhaps Khamenei's most significant geopolitical legacy. This network of allies and proxy forces—including Hezbollah in Lebanon, various Iraqi Shi'ite militias, the Houthi movement in Yemen, and Palestinian groups such as Hamas—has already left an indelible mark on regional politics.[^96] Through these alliances, Khamenei succeeded in creating a regional dynamic centered on Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine, projecting Iranian influence across the Middle East in ways unprecedented in modern Iranian history.[^97] These allies share Khamenei's worldview of an independent region expunged of U.S. forces, though recent losses—particularly the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the decimation of Hezbollah, and setbacks for Hamas—represent severe setbacks for this vision.[^98]

Domestically, Khamenei's most enduring legacy may be the transformation and consolidation of power in the office of the Supreme Leader itself. He is the architect of the rise of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), shaping it into an instrument of control and regional influence that has fundamentally altered Iran's domestic power structure.[^99] The IRGC has become a state within a state, controlling vast sectors of the economy and serving as the regime's primary tool for both internal repression and external power projection. This militarization of the Islamic Republic under Khamenei's leadership has made Iran's governance structure qualitatively different from what Ayatollah Khomeini had originally envisioned.

Iran's nuclear program represents another critical dimension of Khamenei's legacy. He made Iran's nuclear capabilities central to its strategy for national security and deterrence, despite issuing religious edicts forbidding nuclear weapons.[^100] The program has become a source of both national pride and international isolation, with the controversial 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) and its subsequent collapse under the Trump administration epitomizing the tensions in Khamenei's approach to the outside world.[^101]

However, Khamenei's legacy is profoundly contested. His response to the 2009 Green Movement marked a fundamental transformation of the Islamic Republic, as the regime could no longer credibly claim to derive any authority from the consent of the governed.[^102] The brutal suppression of that movement, and later the 2022 Women, Life, Freedom protests following Mahsa Amini's death, revealed the extent to which Khamenei's rule depends on coercion rather than popular legitimacy. The widespread chants of "Death to the Dictator" and "Khamenei is a murderer" during the 2022 protests demonstrated that for many Iranians, particularly the younger generation, his legacy is one of oppression, economic mismanagement, and missed opportunities.[^103]

Recent academic analyses suggest that Khamenei's standing has been damaged by strategic setbacks and "continuous miscalculations, misjudgments, and consistent U-turns" that have "begun to crack the veneer of his radical cult of personality."[^104] The developing cracks in his base of support, particularly following perceived ideological betrayals and the failure to prevent the decimation of Iran's regional allies, suggest that his legacy may ultimately be one of overreach and decline.[^105]

As Supreme Leader for more than three decades, Khamenei has cemented his position as one of the two most consequential figures in the history of the Islamic Republic, alongside Khomeini himself, in terms of shaping the country's trajectory at home and on the world stage.[^106] His leadership has profoundly influenced regional politics through proxy networks, anti-Western ideology, and the consolidation of theocratic power.[^107] Yet the question of succession—potentially to his son Mojtaba—and the unresolved tensions between revolutionary ideology and pragmatic governance will define how his decades in power are ultimately remembered. The controversy over potential hereditary succession itself represents a fundamental challenge to the revolutionary principles upon which his authority theoretically rests.[^108]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Khamenei view him as a steadfast guardian of the Islamic Revolution's principles and a bulwark against Western imperialism and Zionist aggression. His official biography presents him as a leader who has maintained Iran's independence and dignity in the face of enormous external pressure, including crippling economic sanctions and military threats.[^109] From this perspective, his refusal to compromise with the United States and his support for resistance movements throughout the Middle East represent principled stands against hegemonic power.

Scholarly work sympathetic to Khamenei, such as the article "Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei: The Life and Legacy of a Wise Leader" published by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, portrays him as a visionary leader whose guidance has preserved Islamic values in an increasingly secular world.[^110] His supporters credit him with maintaining the Islamic Republic's sovereignty and revolutionary character despite intense international isolation and internal challenges.

From the viewpoint of Iran's revolutionary establishment, Khamenei's consolidation of power in the office of the Supreme Leader and his development of the IRGC represent necessary measures to protect the revolution from internal and external enemies. The "Axis of Resistance" is celebrated as a historic achievement that has empowered oppressed peoples throughout the Middle East and challenged Israeli and American dominance in the region.[^111] His famous declaration to Trump—"Mr. Trump, you can't do a damned thing!"—is cited as evidence of his courage and defiance in the face of superpower pressure.[^112]

Khamenei's issuance of a fatwa against nuclear weapons is highlighted by supporters as evidence of his commitment to Islamic ethical principles and his rejection of weapons of mass destruction on moral grounds, distinguishing Iran's nuclear program from those seeking military applications.[^113] His defenders argue that he has successfully navigated Iran through decades of economic warfare while maintaining the country's scientific and technological advancement, including in nuclear technology, space programs, and missile development.

Those who view Khamenei positively also emphasize his personal modesty and simple lifestyle, contrasting the image of an ascetic religious leader with the materialism of Western political leaders.[^114] His long tenure is portrayed not as autocracy but as continuity and stability in a region plagued by chaos and foreign intervention.

### Negative Views

Critics and opponents of Khamenei present a starkly different assessment, characterizing his rule as dictatorial, repressive, and economically disastrous for Iran. Academic research has documented his systematic consolidation of power and the transformation of Iran into an authoritarian system where unelected institutions controlled by the Supreme Leader dominate elected ones.[^115] Professor Ali Mashayekhi of Sharif University of Technology, for instance, has criticized Iran's dual power structure—where Khamenei and his unelected appointees frequently undermine elected officials—as generating "policy paralysis and mutual recrimination."[^116]

The brutal suppression of the 2009 Green Movement, which killed at least 150 people and imprisoned thousands, is cited as definitive evidence of Khamenei's authoritarian character and willingness to use extreme violence against peaceful protesters.[^117] Human Rights Watch and other international organizations have extensively documented the torture of political prisoners, executions of protesters, and systematic violations of basic freedoms under his leadership.[^118] The 2022 crackdown on Women, Life, Freedom protests, which killed over 500 people and led to mass arrests and executions, further reinforced this assessment.[^119]

A research paper titled "Ali Khamenei: A Criminal in Disguise" exemplifies the harshest scholarly critiques, characterizing him as responsible for crimes against humanity and systematic human rights violations.[^120] Critics point to the execution of thousands of political prisoners, the persecution of religious minorities, severe restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly, and the brutal enforcement of religiously-justified laws as evidence of a criminal regime.

Economic critics highlight the catastrophic mismanagement of Iran's economy under Khamenei's leadership, with crippling inflation, unemployment, and economic isolation causing widespread suffering among ordinary Iranians while the Supreme Leader's family and the IRGC have amassed enormous wealth.[^121] The revelation that Khamenei controls economic holdings worth tens of billions of dollars while ordinary Iranians struggle with poverty is seen as hypocrisy that undermines his claims to religious and moral authority.[^122]

Recent academic analyses have become increasingly critical. An article titled "Khamenei's Brilliant Failure" by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies argues that his strategic vision has proven fundamentally flawed, with the Axis of Resistance collapsing and Iran increasingly isolated.[^123] The Washington Institute for Near East Policy has documented "the developing cracks in Khamenei's cult of personality," noting that "Khamenei's continuous miscalculations, misjudgments, and consistent U-turns have begun to crack the veneer of his radical cult of personality."[^124] Cracks in Khamenei's hardline base have deepened significantly following perceived ideological betrayals, including the failure to prevent the decimation of Hezbollah and Hamas and the loss of Syria.[^125]

An American Enterprise Institute analysis of the potential succession of Mojtaba Khamenei characterizes the situation as highlighting "the Islamic Republic's weakness," suggesting that the regime has become so dependent on personal loyalty to Khamenei that it cannot envision a legitimate transfer of power.[^126] The controversy over potential hereditary succession is seen as exposing the fundamental contradiction between the Islamic Republic's revolutionary rhetoric and its increasingly dynastic character.

International legal scholars and human rights organizations have called for Khamenei to be held accountable for crimes against humanity, including the systematic torture and execution of political dissidents and the violent suppression of peaceful protests.[^127] The UN investigation that found Iran responsible for Mahsa Amini's death represents the growing international consensus that Khamenei's government bears direct responsibility for egregious human rights violations.[^128]
