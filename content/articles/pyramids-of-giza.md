## Summary

The Pyramids of Giza are ancient Egyptian pyramid complexes located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt. Built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom (c. 2580-2560 BCE), the complex includes three main pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), the Pyramid of Khafre (Chephren), and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with the Great Sphinx and several smaller satellite pyramids. The Great Pyramid is the largest and oldest, originally standing 481 feet tall, and was the world's tallest human-made structure for over 3,800 years. These pyramids served as elaborate tombs for pharaohs and are the only surviving Wonder of the Ancient World. They represent the pinnacle of Egyptian pyramid construction and remain enduring symbols of ancient Egyptian civilization.

## The Great Pyramid of Khufu

**Construction:**
- Built c. 2580-2560 BCE
- Pharaoh: Khufu (Cheops)
- **Original height**: 481 feet (146.5 m)
- **Current height**: 455 feet (138.8 m) - lost outer casing
- **Base**: 755 feet (230 m) per side
- **Volume**: 2.6 million cubic meters
- **Stones**: ~2.3 million blocks, averaging 2.5 tons each

**Engineering Marvel:**
- Aligned precisely with cardinal directions (error <0.05°)
- Built without iron tools, wheels, or pulleys (Bronze Age)
- Enormous labor: estimates 10,000-100,000 workers over 20 years
- Workers were paid laborers, not slaves (recent evidence)
- Construction methods still debated (ramps, internal ramps, etc.)

**Interior:**
- King's Chamber (granite)
- Queen's Chamber
- Grand Gallery
- Narrow shafts (purpose unclear: ventilation? Stellar alignment?)

## Pyramid of Khafre

**Construction:**
- Built c. 2570 BCE
- Pharaoh: Khafre (Khufu's son)
- **Height**: 448 feet (136.4 m)
- Appears taller than Great Pyramid (built on higher ground)
- Retains some original limestone casing at apex

---

## Pyramid of Menkaure

**Construction:**
- Built c. 2510 BCE
- Pharaoh: Menkaure (Khafre's son)
- **Height**: 213 feet (65 m)
- Smallest of the three
- Granite casing (lower 16 courses)

## The Great Sphinx

**Description:**
- Massive limestone statue
- Body of lion, human head (likely Khafre)
- **Length**: 240 feet (73 m)
- **Height**: 66 feet (20 m)
- Carved from bedrock
- Missing nose (vandalized, not by Napoleon's troops as myth claims)

**Purpose:**
- Guardian of Giza necropolis
- Symbol of pharaoh's power
- Possible solar deity connection

---

## Purpose and Beliefs

**Tombs:**
- Houses for pharaohs' bodies in afterlife
- Preserved through mummification
- Contained treasures, food, servants (shabtis) for next world

**Solar Religion:**
- Pyramid shape may represent sun's rays
- Connection to sun god Ra
- Pharaohs believed to become stars or join Ra's solar boat

**Pyramid Texts:**
- Religious inscriptions inside later pyramids
- Spells to help pharaoh reach afterlife

## Construction Theories

**Traditional View:**
- External ramps (straight, spiral, or zigzag)
- Teams dragging stones on sledges
- Copper tools, dolerite hammers
- Water and sand for leveling

**Alternative Theories:**
- Internal ramps (Jean-Pierre Houdin)
- Counterweights
- Some fringe theories (aliens, lost technology) rejected by scholars

**Worker Village:**
- Discovered near pyramids
- Evidence of paid labor, medical care, bread/beer rations
- Debunks slave myth

## Later History

**Ancient Tourism:**
- Greek and Roman tourists visited, wrote graffiti
- Herodotus described them (5th century BCE)

**Arab Period:**
- Caliph Al-Ma'mun forced entry into Great Pyramid (9th century CE)
- Sought treasure (found none)

**Looting:**
- Outer limestone casing stripped for building Cairo
- Interior treasures looted in antiquity

**Modern Era:**
- Archaeological excavations (19th-20th centuries)
- Tourism (millions of visitors annually)
- Conservation efforts

## Mysteries and Theories

**Unresolved Questions:**
- Exact construction methods
- Purpose of shafts
- Why pyramid shape chosen
- Khufu's body never found

**Pseudoscience:**
- "Pyramid power" (debunked)
- Alien construction (no evidence)
- Advanced lost civilization (no evidence)
- Mathematical/astronomical coincidences (mostly cherry-picked)
