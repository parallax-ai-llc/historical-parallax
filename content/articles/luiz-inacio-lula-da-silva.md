## Summary

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, is a Brazilian politician and former metalworker who served as the 35th President of Brazil from 2003 to 2010, and returned to the presidency in 2023 for a third term. Rising from poverty to become one of Brazil's most influential political figures, Lula founded the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT) and championed policies that lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty during his first presidency. His political career has been marked by dramatic highs and lows, including imprisonment on corruption charges in 2018, his convictions being annulled in 2021, and his subsequent political comeback. Lula remains one of the most polarizing and significant figures in Latin American politics, with supporters praising his social programs and critics condemning alleged corruption during his administrations.

## Early Life and Background

Luiz Inácio da Silva was born on October 27, 1945, in Caetés, a small town in the impoverished northeastern state of Pernambuco, Brazil.[^1] He was the seventh of eight children born to Aristides Inácio da Silva and Eurídice Ferreira de Melo. His family lived in extreme poverty, a condition that would profoundly shape his political consciousness and future advocacy for Brazil's poor.[^2]

When Lula was seven years old, his mother moved the family to São Paulo in search of better opportunities, a journey that took thirteen days by pau-de-arara (open-bed truck), a common mode of transportation for poor migrants at the time.[^3] The family settled in the port city of Santos before moving to São Paulo proper, where they lived in a single room in the working-class neighborhood of Vila Carioca.[^4]

Lula's formal education was minimal. He attended school only through the fourth grade, leaving at age twelve to work and help support his family.[^5] His early jobs included shining shoes and working as a street vendor. At fourteen, he secured a position as an office boy at a warehouse, and later worked at a copper-pressing factory.[^6] It was during his time as a metalworker at Villares Metalworks that Lula received technical training as a lathe operator, a skill that would define his early adult life and political identity.[^7]

Tragedy struck in 1971 when Lula's first wife, Maria de Lourdes da Silva, died during childbirth along with their son. This devastating loss came just as Lula was beginning to engage more seriously with trade union activities.[^8] The experience of working in dangerous factory conditions—Lula himself lost his left pinky finger in a workplace accident in 1964—combined with the poverty of his childhood, cultivated a deep awareness of workers' rights and social inequality.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Lula's political ascent began in the trade union movement of the late 1970s, during Brazil's military dictatorship (1964-1985). In 1975, he was elected president of the Steel Workers' Union of São Bernardo do Campo and Diadema, major industrial suburbs of São Paulo.[^10] Unlike the compliant union leaders of the era who cooperated with the military regime and employers, Lula advocated for genuine workers' rights and mobilized for better wages and working conditions.[^11]

The pivotal moment came in 1978-1980 when Lula led a series of strikes involving hundreds of thousands of metalworkers in the ABC region (Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo, and São Caetano do Sul) of Greater São Paulo.[^12] These strikes were groundbreaking in challenging both the military government and the prevailing labor relations system. Despite government repression—Lula was arrested and detained for 31 days in 1980—the strikes achieved significant wage increases and established Lula as a national figure.[^13]

In 1980, Lula co-founded the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT), a political party that brought together trade unionists, intellectuals, and progressive Catholic activists inspired by liberation theology.[^14] The PT was novel in Brazilian politics: it rejected the clientelism and corruption that characterized traditional parties and positioned itself as a democratic socialist alternative committed to fighting inequality and empowering the working class.[^15]

Lula ran for governor of São Paulo in 1982, finishing fourth, but his national profile continued to grow.[^16] He was elected to Congress as a federal deputy in 1986 and played a role in the constituent assembly that drafted Brazil's 1988 democratic constitution.[^17] Lula ran for president in 1989, Brazil's first direct presidential election in nearly thirty years, losing in a runoff to Fernando Collor de Mello in a campaign marked by elite fear-mongering about Lula's socialist policies.[^18]

After losing presidential bids in 1994 and 1998 to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Lula moderated his image and platform. By 2002, he had adopted more market-friendly positions, chose business-friendly running mate José Alencar, and published a "Letter to the Brazilian People" promising to honor contracts and maintain fiscal responsibility.[^19] This strategic repositioning, combined with widespread discontent over economic stagnation and inequality, led to Lula's victory in the 2002 presidential election with 61.3% of the vote in the runoff.[^20]

## Major Achievements

Lula's first presidency (2003-2010) is widely regarded as transformative for Brazil, particularly in reducing poverty and inequality. His signature achievement was the expansion of Bolsa Família, a conditional cash transfer program that provided direct financial assistance to poor families, conditional on children attending school and receiving vaccinations.[^21] By 2010, Bolsa Família reached approximately 50 million Brazilians—nearly a quarter of the population—and contributed to a significant reduction in extreme poverty and income inequality.[^22]

During Lula's tenure, approximately 20 million Brazilians rose out of poverty, and another 29 million entered the middle class, according to government statistics.[^23] The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell from 0.58 in 2002 to 0.52 in 2010, one of the largest reductions in inequality recorded in any country during that period.[^24] The minimum wage increased by approximately 70% in real terms between 2003 and 2010, directly benefiting millions of workers.[^25]

Lula's economic stewardship coincided with favorable global conditions, particularly the commodities boom driven by Chinese demand for Brazilian iron ore, soybeans, and other exports.[^26] His government maintained fiscal discipline while increasing social spending, satisfying both international markets and domestic constituencies. Brazil achieved investment-grade credit ratings from major agencies, attracting foreign investment and boosting economic confidence.[^27]

In foreign policy, Lula pursued an activist agenda aimed at elevating Brazil's global profile and strengthening South-South cooperation. He played a leading role in creating the G20 group of developing nations within the World Trade Organization, challenging the dominance of wealthy nations in trade negotiations.[^28] Lula also promoted regional integration in South America, supporting the creation of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and strengthening Mercosur.[^29]

Lula's government expanded access to higher education through programs like ProUni (University for All Program), which provided scholarships and subsidies for low-income students to attend private universities, and REUNI, which expanded the federal university system.[^30] The number of students in higher education nearly doubled during his presidency.[^31]

Infrastructure investment increased significantly, with the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) launching major projects in transportation, energy, and urban development.[^32] Pre-salt oil discoveries off Brazil's coast in 2007 promised future energy independence and wealth, though full exploitation would take years.[^33]

When Lula left office in 2010, he enjoyed an approval rating of 87%, one of the highest recorded for any world leader.[^34] His success in combining economic growth with poverty reduction earned Brazil international admiration and made Lula a model for progressive governance in developing countries.[^35]

After twelve years out of office, Lula returned to the presidency in 2023 following a narrow victory over incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. His third term has focused on reversing Bolsonaro's environmental policies, particularly regarding Amazon deforestation, and restoring social programs that had been reduced.[^36]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Lula's legacy is deeply tarnished by corruption scandals, most notably the Mensalão and Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) investigations. The Mensalão ("big monthly payment") scandal emerged in 2005 when it was revealed that PT operatives had paid monthly bribes to opposition congressmen to secure their votes for government legislation.[^37] While Lula denied knowledge of the scheme, his chief of staff José Dirceu and several other close associates were convicted in what Brazil's Supreme Court called "one of the largest corruption schemes in Brazilian history."[^38]

The Lava Jato investigation, which began in 2014, uncovered massive corruption involving Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled oil company, where executives, politicians, and construction companies colluded in a kickback scheme worth billions of dollars.[^39] In 2017, Lula was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption for allegedly receiving a beachfront apartment from construction company OAS in exchange for political favors related to Petrobras contracts.[^40]

In 2018, Lula was sentenced to 12 years in prison and began serving his sentence in April of that year, despite maintaining his innocence and claiming the charges were politically motivated.[^41] His imprisonment prevented him from running in the 2018 presidential election, which was won by far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro.[^42] In 2021, Brazil's Supreme Court annulled Lula's convictions, ruling that the trial judge, Sergio Moro, had been biased and that the trial should have been held in a different jurisdiction.[^43] The ruling restored Lula's political rights and enabled his 2022 presidential campaign.[^44]

Critics argue that Lula's social programs, while reducing poverty, created dependency rather than sustainable development and failed to address structural economic problems.[^45] They contend that Brazil's economic growth during his presidency was primarily driven by the global commodities boom rather than sound policy, and that opportunities for structural reforms—such as tax reform, labor market modernization, and infrastructure investment—were missed.[^46]

Lula's foreign policy also drew criticism, particularly his close relationships with authoritarian leaders such as Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, and Fidel Castro of Cuba.[^47] His 2010 agreement with Iran and Turkey regarding Iran's nuclear program was criticized as naive and undermining international efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.[^48]

Environmental critics point to increased Amazon deforestation during Lula's first presidency, despite some conservation achievements.[^49] Agricultural expansion, particularly for soy and cattle, accelerated during his tenure, contributing to habitat loss and indigenous displacement.[^50]

## Personal Life

Lula married three times and has five children. His first wife, Maria de Lourdes da Silva, whom he married in 1969, died in childbirth in 1971 along with their son, a tragedy that profoundly affected him.[^51] In 1974, he married Marisa Letícia Rocco Casa, with whom he had three sons: Fábio Luís, Sandro Luís, and Luís Cláudio (Lulinha).[^52] Marisa was Lula's closest advisor and political partner for over four decades until her death from a stroke in 2017.[^53]

In 2022, at age 76, Lula married Rosângela da Silva, known as Janja, a sociologist and political activist whom he had met at a political event in 2017.[^54] Janja became an active presence in his 2022 presidential campaign and serves as First Lady in his third term.[^55]

Lula's public persona combines elements of the common man—he frequently uses colloquial language, tells jokes, and emphasizes his working-class origins—with shrewd political instincts and negotiating skills.[^56] He is known for his charisma and ability to connect with ordinary Brazilians, often speaking in a folksy manner that contrasts with the elite backgrounds of most Brazilian politicians.[^57]

Despite limited formal education, Lula is regarded as a skilled negotiator and consensus-builder who can navigate Brazil's complex political system, which requires extensive coalition-building due to fragmented party representation in Congress.[^58] His nickname "Lula," which he officially added to his legal name in the 1980s to appear on ballots, has become synonymous with his political brand.[^59]

Lula's lifestyle has been subject to scrutiny, with critics pointing to allegations of improper property holdings, including the controversial beachfront apartment at the center of his corruption conviction, and a country estate.[^60] Supporters counter that compared to Brazil's traditional elite, Lula's personal wealth remains modest.[^61]

## Legacy

Lula's legacy is one of the most contested in contemporary Latin American politics, reflecting deep ideological and class divisions in Brazilian society. For supporters, he represents the possibility of progressive change and social inclusion in a historically unequal society. His success in lifting millions out of poverty while maintaining economic stability provides a counterexample to neoliberal orthodoxy and demonstrates that social democracy can work in developing countries.[^62]

The expansion of Bolsa Família has been emulated by other Latin American countries and studied by development economists worldwide as a model for conditional cash transfer programs.[^63] Lula's presidency coincided with a broader "pink tide" of left-leaning governments across Latin America, and he became an international symbol of this movement.[^64]

For critics, Lula's legacy is inseparable from the corruption that characterized PT governance, particularly the Petrobras scandal. They argue that the failure to prosecute corrupt officials adequately during his presidency created a culture of impunity that ultimately undermined democratic institutions.[^65] The economic problems that emerged after his presidency—Brazil entered a deep recession in 2014-2016—are attributed by critics to unsustainable policies and missed opportunities for reform during the boom years.[^66]

Lula's political resilience is remarkable. From union leader to president, from prison to the presidency again, his career trajectory is unprecedented in Brazilian history and rare globally.[^67] His ability to return to power at age 77, after imprisonment and political exile, demonstrates both his enduring popularity among significant segments of Brazilian society and the volatility of Brazilian politics.[^68]

The PT, which Lula founded, remains one of Brazil's major political parties, though its dominance has been challenged by both right-wing and centrist alternatives.[^69] Lula's political style—combining leftist rhetoric with pragmatic governance and coalition-building—has influenced a generation of Latin American politicians.[^70]

Internationally, Lula elevated Brazil's profile significantly. His advocacy for developing nations, leadership in climate negotiations, and mediation efforts in international conflicts positioned Brazil as a major emerging power.[^71] However, the sustainability of this elevated status beyond his presidency remains questionable, as Brazil's influence has waxed and waned with different administrations.[^72]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic assessments of Lula's presidency frequently highlight his success in combining economic growth with poverty reduction, a achievement that has earned comparisons to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.[^73] Economist Joseph Stiglitz praised Lula's economic policies, arguing that they demonstrated how social inclusion and economic growth could be mutually reinforcing rather than contradictory.[^74]

In 2009, President Barack Obama called Lula "the most popular politician on Earth," reflecting the Brazilian president's extraordinary approval ratings and international stature.[^75] The Economist, despite its generally market-oriented perspective, acknowledged in 2010 that Lula's presidency had been "widely successful" and that his social programs had achieved "remarkable" results in poverty reduction.[^76]

Scholars of Latin American politics view Lula as representing the potential for democratic socialism to address historical inequalities without revolutionary upheaval. Political scientist Timothy Power described Lula's presidency as "one of the most successful in modern Brazilian history," noting that he "governed from the left while maintaining macroeconomic stability."[^77]

Lula's defenders argue that the corruption allegations against him were exaggerated and politically motivated, part of a "lawfare" campaign by conservative elites threatened by his political success and his party's longevity in power.[^78] They point to the annulment of his convictions and revelations about then-judge Sergio Moro's communications with prosecutors as evidence of judicial bias.[^79]

Environmental advocates credit Lula's first presidency with significant achievements in Amazon conservation, including the creation of protected areas and a notable reduction in deforestation rates between 2004 and 2007 through enhanced enforcement and monitoring.[^80] His return to the presidency in 2023 has been welcomed by environmentalists concerned about reversing the damage of the Bolsonaro years.[^81]

---

### Negative Views

Critics from the political right and center view Lula as a demagogue who exploited class resentment and engaged in populist politics that undermined institutional integrity.[^82] They argue that his social programs created dependency on government handouts rather than fostering economic opportunity and that his presidency represented a missed chance to modernize Brazil's economy.[^83]

Conservative political analyst Roberto Campos Neto characterized Lula's economic policies as "fiscally irresponsible" and argued that they contributed to the severe economic crisis that followed his presidency.[^84] Critics contend that the commodity boom, rather than policy excellence, drove growth during Lula's tenure, and that structural problems—including low productivity, poor education, inadequate infrastructure, and complex taxation—worsened or were ignored.[^85]

The corruption scandals have led many observers, particularly in Brazil's business community and among middle-class voters, to view Lula as fundamentally dishonest, regardless of the legal status of his convictions.[^86] Political scientist Sergio Abranches argued that the PT under Lula created "one of the most sophisticated corruption systems ever devised," involving systematic kickbacks from contractors and businesses.[^87]

Lula's foreign policy has been criticized as ideologically driven and insufficiently attentive to human rights concerns. His support for Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, even as democratic institutions eroded and humanitarian crises emerged, has been particularly controversial.[^88] Human rights organizations criticized his reluctance to condemn authoritarianism among left-wing allies.[^89]

Some progressive critics argue that Lula's policies, while reducing absolute poverty, failed to challenge fundamental structures of inequality in Brazil and that his accommodations with agribusiness, extractive industries, and financial sectors betrayed the transformative vision of the early PT.[^90] They contend that Bolsa Família, while beneficial, was a Band-Aid on systemic problems requiring deeper structural reforms, including land reform, progressive taxation, and democratization of media ownership.[^91]
