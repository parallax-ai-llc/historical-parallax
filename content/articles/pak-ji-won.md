## Summary

Pak Ji-won (朴趾源, 1737-1805), styled Yeonam (燕巖, "Rock of Swallow"), was one of the most influential philosophers, novelists, and reformist thinkers of the late Joseon Dynasty.[^1] A leading figure in the Silhak (Practical Learning) movement and the Northern Learning School (Bukhak), he advocated for importing advanced technologies from Qing China, promoting mercantilism, and implementing sweeping social and economic reforms.[^2] His satirical novels, including the celebrated *Jehol Diary* (*Yeolha Ilgi*), *Tale of a Yangban* (*Yangban Jeon*), and *Tiger's Rebuke* (*Hojil*), revolutionized Korean literature by making marginalized social groups the protagonists of classical Chinese prose.[^3] Despite suffering from depression and repeated rejection in state examinations due to his radical views, Pak eventually served as a magistrate in multiple counties and left an enduring legacy as a harbinger of Korean literary modernism and social reform.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Pak Ji-won was born on February 5, 1737, in Bansongbang (盤松坊), near Seoul's Jongno-gu district, in the Yadong (冶洞) neighborhood.[^5] He came from a distinguished aristocratic family of modest means belonging to the Bannam Pak clan (潘南 朴氏), one of the yangban families that had produced scholars and officials for generations.[^6] His formal name was Mijung (美仲), and he adopted several pen names throughout his life, including Yeonam (燕巖), Yeonsang (煙湘), and Yeolsangoesa (洌上外史), with Yeonam becoming his most famous sobriquet.[^7]

Pak received an exceptional classical education from multiple distinguished mentors. His grandfather, Pak Pilgyun (朴弼均, 1685-1760), introduced him to various classics and historical works, particularly the *Shiji* (*Records of the Grand Historian*) by Sima Qian, which profoundly influenced his historical thinking and narrative style.[^8] In 1752, at age fifteen, Pak married the daughter of Yi Bocheon (李輔天), a respected scholar whose family became instrumental in his intellectual development.[^9] Both his father-in-law Yi Bocheon and Yi Bocheon's brother Yi Yangcheon (李亮天) continued his education in classical Chinese literature and Confucian philosophy.[^10]

From an early age, Pak demonstrated intellectual brilliance and an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond the rigid Confucian orthodoxy of Joseon society. He was exposed to the emerging Silhak (Practical Learning) movement, which emphasized empirical investigation, practical knowledge, and social utility over abstract Neo-Confucian metaphysics.[^11] This intellectual environment shaped his lifelong commitment to reform and his belief in *iyonghusaeng* (利用厚生), a principle advocating economic enrichment, convenient use of goods, and sufficient food and clothing to improve people's lives.[^12]

The young Pak Ji-won grew up during a period of relative stability under King Yeongjo's reign but also witnessed the growing stagnation and conservatism that plagued Joseon society in the eighteenth century. The yangban class, to which he belonged, had become increasingly parasitic, clinging to empty rituals while ignoring practical governance and technological advancement.[^13] These observations during his formative years would later fuel his satirical critiques of the yangban system and his passionate advocacy for reform.

## Rise to Power

Pak Ji-won's path to prominence was anything but conventional. Unlike most yangban scholars who achieved status through success in the civil service examinations (*gwageo*), Pak's journey was marked by repeated failure, personal struggle, and eventual recognition through his literary genius rather than bureaucratic credentials.[^14]

In his youth, Pak suffered from severe depression, anorexia, and insomnia while preparing for state examinations.[^15] His examination answer sheets were consistently rejected because he continued to point out society's absurdities from a radical perspective, despite hailing from a prestigious Noron faction family that wielded considerable power.[^16] The examination officials found his critical thinking and reformist ideas too dangerous for the conservative Joseon establishment. At age thirty-five, Pak finally abandoned his attempts to pass the examination and become a government official through conventional means.[^17]

The execution of his close friend Yi Heecheon (Lee Hee-cheon) in 1771 for possessing a book compiled by a Qing Dynasty scholar dealt Pak a devastating emotional blow.[^18] This traumatic event reinforced his decision to never take the civil service examination again and instead devote himself entirely to the study of Silhak and the pursuit of practical knowledge that could benefit Korean society.[^19] Pak became a follower of Bukhak (Northern Learning), a branch of Silhak that aimed to understand and adopt the superior aspects of Qing Dynasty culture, science, and technology.[^20]

Pak's rise to intellectual prominence came through his association with other brilliant Silhak scholars, particularly Hong Daeyong (洪大容), a close friend and fellow leader of the Profitable Usage school.[^21] Together with Hong, Pak argued that the Earth was round, not flat—a revolutionary claim in conservative Joseon society that clung to traditional cosmology.[^22] After Hong Daeyong's return from China, the two scholars collaborated in forming the Bukhak group, which became the intellectual vanguard of reformist thought in late eighteenth-century Korea.[^23]

The watershed moment in Pak's career came in 1780 when King Jeongjo commanded him to accompany royal envoys on a tributary mission to China to celebrate the seventieth birthday of Qing Emperor Qianlong at his summer residence in Jehol (Rehe), northeast of Beijing.[^24] This journey, though nominally diplomatic, became a transformative intellectual experience. Pak documented everything he observed during the five-month trip, producing the *Jehol Diary* (*Yeolha Ilgi*), a massive work extending to twenty-six chapters and ten volumes in its original classical Chinese version.[^25]

The *Jehol Diary* was far more than a travel account. It was a comprehensive analysis of Qing China's superior material culture, technological achievements, and institutional innovations, combined with a scathing critique of Joseon's backwardness and uneconomic practices.[^26] Although conservative yangban found the work distasteful because they believed Pak had praised the Manchu "barbarians," the diary became enormously influential among reform-minded intellectuals.[^27] King Jeongjo himself took issue with the prevalence of Pak's distinctive writing style, known as Yeonamche, which spread rapidly among educated elites.[^28]

By the time Pak obtained his first minor government position at age fifty in 1791 as Assistant Prefect at Hanseong City (漢城府判官), he was already a bestselling author and the acknowledged leader of the Bukhak group.[^29] His literary reputation preceded his bureaucratic career, an unusual reversal of the typical yangban trajectory. He subsequently served as Magistrate of Anui County (安義縣監) in 1792, Magistrate of Myeoncheon County (沔川郡守) in 1797, and Magistrate of Yangyang District (襄陽府使) in 1800.[^30]

## Major Achievements

Pak Ji-won's achievements spanned literature, philosophy, governance, and social reform, making him one of the most versatile intellectuals in Korean history. His contributions can be divided into several major categories:

### Literary Innovation and the Revolution of Korean Prose

Pak Ji-won is widely regarded as the most acclaimed writer in the history of classical Korean literature, occupying the highest reputation and status in pre-modern Korean prose.[^31] His revolutionary approach involved writing in the most abstruse literary Chinese (*hanmun*) about the lives of ordinary, marginalized people—a radical departure from traditional yangban literature that focused exclusively on elite subjects.[^32]

His satirical novel *Tale of a Yangban* (*Yangban Jeon*) lampooned the hypocrisy and incompetence of the yangban scholar-official class, exposing how these supposedly noble elites had become parasitic burdens on society.[^33] *Tiger's Rebuke* (*Hojil*), written during his journey to China, satirized the hypocrisy of Confucian scholars through the voice of a tiger criticizing human pretensions.[^34] *Tale of Master Heo* (*Heosaengjeon*), perhaps his most famous satirical work, featured a brilliant but frustrated commoner scholar who attempts to reform society through unorthodox means.[^35]

Pak's literary genius lay in his ability to combine satire with empathy, using the novel as a vessel for debates on ideology, economic systems, institutions, philosophy, and psychology.[^36] As translator Emanuel Pastreich noted, Pak took "the classical language of literary Chinese to describe the downtrodden such as beggars, merchants of night soil, charlatans, and poor widows who were marginal in Korean literature," making them protagonists—a revolution that shocked the literary establishment.[^37]

His writing style was extraordinarily flexible, utilizing various forms including Seonjin yanghan gomun (先秦兩漢古文, old proses of the Qin and Han dynasties), Dangsong gomun (唐宋古文, old proses of Tang and Song dynasties), Sopummun (小品文, essays on minor subjects), and Paegwan soseol (稗官小說, novels of story collectors).[^38] This stylistic versatility allowed him to adapt classical Chinese literary forms to address contemporary Korean social realities, creating what scholar Kim Taekyeong (1850-1927) later recognized as comparable to the achievements of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song dynasties.[^39]

### Philosophical Leadership in the Silhak Movement

Pak Ji-won served as the intellectual center of the Iyonghusaengpa (利用厚生派, School of Profitable Usage and Benefiting the People), a major branch of the Silhak movement.[^40] This school promoted industrialization, commercial development, and the introduction of Western technologies to Joseon Korea through positive engagement with Qing China.[^41] His philosophy emphasized practical benefits for ordinary people over abstract metaphysical speculation, a radical departure from orthodox Neo-Confucianism.

As an advocate of Northern Studies (Bukhak) within the broader Practical Studies movement, Pak sought to bring natural science, applied science, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, and institutional reforms from eighteenth-century Qing China to Korea.[^42] His influence extended to a generation of younger scholars, including Pak Chega (Pak Je-ga), Yu Deukgong, and Yi Deokmu, who became known as the "Four Geomseo" appointed by King Jeongjo to the Kyujanggak royal library.[^43]

### Economic and Social Reform Proposals

Pak Ji-won proposed comprehensive reforms across multiple domains. He advocated that Joseon import advanced technologies from the Qing Dynasty and actively promote mercantilism to strengthen the national economy.[^44] He called for limiting large-scale landholding, allotting land to peasants, eliminating class inequality, and encouraging trade and industry—proposals that directly challenged the yangban-dominated feudal system.[^45]

In the *Jehol Diary*, Pak provided detailed analyses of Qing China's superior agricultural techniques, commercial practices, manufacturing methods, and infrastructure, contrasting them with Joseon's backward approaches.[^46] He was an early advocate of sustainability, lamenting how Korean potters stripped pine forests bare in their insatiable use of fuel, demonstrating environmental consciousness rare for his era.[^47]

When King Jeongjo issued him an official letter in 1798 requesting agricultural reform proposals while Pak served as Magistrate of Myeoncheon County, Pak devoted the *Gwanongsocho* to the king, a comprehensive agricultural reform treatise.[^48] His land reform proposals noted that farmers complained, "Even if you work hard all year round, you will not be able to afford salt," and he proposed restructuring land ownership to address this fundamental injustice.[^49]

### Government Service and Practical Administration

Despite obtaining government positions relatively late in life, Pak demonstrated exceptional administrative ability. In 1792, while traveling to his post as Magistrate of Anui County, he received a request from the governor of Gyeongsang Province in Daegu to investigate four murder cases, which he successfully resolved through careful investigation and judicial reasoning.[^50]

During his magistrate positions, Pak continued writing prolifically, including a preface to *Hongbeomuik*, a controversial preface to *Yeollyeo Hamyang Pakssijeonbyeongseo* that criticized the tradition of widows maintaining chastity unto death, and a full-length classical Chinese poem called *Haeinsa*.[^51] His governance philosophy emphasized practical benefits for local populations over rigid adherence to Confucian ritual, making him an effective administrator despite his late start in official service.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Pak Ji-won's radical ideas and unconventional approach generated substantial controversy during his lifetime and sparked debates about his legacy that continue today.

### Conservative Opposition and the *Jehol Diary* Controversy

The conservative upper class found the *Jehol Diary* deeply offensive because they believed Pak had tried to curry favor with the Qing Dynasty, ruled by Manchus whom orthodox Joseon scholars considered barbarians.[^52] The ruling class of the Joseon Kingdom viewed the Qing Dynasty as an illegitimate regime, maintaining loyalty to the vanquished Ming Dynasty as the only legitimate Chinese government.[^53] When Pak praised aspects of Qing civilization, economy, and technology, conservative officials felt he had betrayed Joseon's ideological commitment to Ming legitimacy and Confucian cultural purity.[^54]

King Jeongjo himself expressed concern about the widespread influence of Pak's writing style (Yeonamche), suggesting that the monarch found Pak's literary influence potentially destabilizing to orthodox literary and ideological norms.[^55] The prevalence of Pak's style among intellectuals indicated a growing appetite for his critical, reformist perspective—a development that alarmed conservative authorities who sought to maintain the status quo.

### Critique of the Yangban Class and Social Hierarchy

Pak Ji-won and his colleague Pak Chega openly criticized the formalism of traditional scholars and called for economic and political reforms that threatened the yangban class's privileged position.[^56] In the *Jehol Diary* and his satirical novels, Pak subjected the prevailing Confucian philosophy to criticism from the standpoint of natural science and empirical observation, attributing Korea's economic and cultural backwardness to the laziness and parasitism of the ruling yangban class.[^57]

This direct assault on yangban privilege made Pak many enemies among the conservative establishment. His examination failures and delayed government appointment can be partially attributed to powerful officials who viewed his ideas as dangerously subversive. His argument for "eliminating class inequality" directly challenged the rigid social hierarchy (*yangban*-*chungin*-*sangmin*-*cheonmin*) that formed the foundation of Joseon society.[^58]

### Limitations and Blind Spots in His Reform Vision

While Pak was remarkably progressive for his time, modern scholars have identified limitations in his reformist vision. His proposals for technological adoption and commercial development were primarily oriented toward strengthening the existing state structure rather than fundamentally democratizing power.[^59] Despite criticizing yangban privilege, Pak remained a yangban himself and did not advocate for complete social revolution or elimination of the class system—only its modification.

Furthermore, Pak's focus on learning from Qing China, while prescient in recognizing China's technological and commercial sophistication, did not extend to serious engagement with Western knowledge and technology, which would soon prove crucial for Korean modernization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[^60] His Northern Learning remained fundamentally Sinocentric, missing the emerging global reconfigurations of power.

### Personal Struggles and Mental Health

Pak's struggle with depression, anorexia, and insomnia during his examination preparation years revealed the psychological toll of living as an intellectual ahead of his time in a profoundly conservative society.[^61] His repeated rejection in state examinations, though partially due to his radical ideas, also represented a personal failure to navigate the established system successfully. Unlike contemporaries who maintained outward orthodoxy while pursuing private reforms, Pak's uncompromising intellectual honesty cost him decades of potential influence in government.[^62]

The devastating impact of his friend Yi Heecheon's execution for possessing a Qing Dynasty book demonstrated the dangers faced by reform-minded scholars.[^63] Pak's decision to abandon examination attempts after this traumatic event, while principled, also limited his ability to implement reforms from positions of greater authority.

---

## Personal Life

Pak Ji-won's personal life was marked by intellectual companionship, family connections, and the psychological struggles of a visionary thinker in a conservative society.

### Family and Marriage

In 1752, at age fifteen, Pak married the daughter of Yi Bocheon (李輔天), a respected scholar.[^64] This marriage proved intellectually beneficial, as Yi Bocheon and his brother Yi Yangcheon became important mentors to the young Pak, deepening his classical education.[^65] Pak's wife's family connections provided him with access to broader scholarly networks and alternative intellectual traditions beyond his own family's teachings.

Pak had a son named Pak Jong-chae, who wrote detailed descriptions of his father's physical appearance in a work called *Gwagwon-rok*.[^66] According to Jong-chae's account, Pak Ji-won was tall and very large, with a long face, prominent cheekbones, and double eyelids—a description that matches surviving portraits of the scholar.[^67] This filial documentation suggests a close father-son relationship and Pak Jong-chae's desire to preserve his father's memory for posterity.

Pak's grandson, Hwanjae Pak Gyu-su (朴珪壽, 1807-1877), became a major figure in the formation of the enlightenment faction (*Gaehwa*) in the late Joseon Dynasty, serving as a scholar-bureaucrat, teacher, politician, and diplomat who continued his grandfather's reformist legacy.[^68] Pak Gyu-su achieved the high position of Right State Councilor and was recognized as a meritorious retainer of the Jongmyo Shrine and father of the reformist faction, demonstrating how Pak Ji-won's intellectual legacy extended through his family lineage.[^69]

### Intellectual Friendships and Collaborations

Pak's closest intellectual friendship was with Hong Daeyong (洪大容), another leader of the Profitable Usage school within Silhak.[^70] Together, they argued for the radical proposition that the Earth was round, not flat, challenging traditional cosmology.[^71] After Hong Daeyong's return from China, he and Pak participated in forming the Bukhak (Northern Learning) group, creating an intellectual community that supported each other's heterodox ideas.[^72]

The tragedy of Yi Heecheon's execution in 1771 profoundly affected Pak emotionally and philosophically.[^73] This friend's death for the seemingly minor transgression of possessing a Qing Dynasty book illustrated the dangers faced by intellectuals who challenged orthodoxy and reinforced Pak's decision to pursue reform through literature and indirect influence rather than direct political confrontation.

Pak's influence extended to younger scholars who became his students and followers. Pak Chega (Pak Je-ga), Yu Deukgong, and Yi Deokmu were all influenced by Pak Chiwŏn and formed part of the intellectual circle known as the Yeonam Group.[^74] These relationships created a multigenerational reformist tradition that extended Pak's influence well beyond his lifetime.

### Personality and Character

Contemporary and historical accounts describe Pak as unusually creative, inquisitive, and open to new ideas and ways of thinking—qualities that set him apart from his conservative contemporaries.[^75] Unlike scholars who were content with the Confucian way of thinking and made little effort to move forward, Pak possessed intellectual restlessness and insatiable curiosity about alternative approaches to governance, literature, and social organization.

His willingness to praise aspects of Qing Dynasty civilization, despite the strong anti-Manchu prejudice among Joseon yangban, demonstrated intellectual independence and empirical honesty.[^76] Pak was willing to admire what he found admirable, regardless of ideological preconceptions—a scientific attitude rare among scholars of his time.

Pak's struggles with depression and examination failure reveal vulnerability beneath his intellectual brilliance. His mental health challenges during his youth, combined with the professional setbacks of repeated examination rejection, would have broken many scholars. Instead, Pak channeled his frustration into revolutionary literary works and philosophical treatises that ultimately proved more influential than any government position he might have obtained through conventional means.[^77]

## Legacy

Pak Ji-won's legacy as one of Korea's greatest intellectuals and literary figures has grown considerably since his death, with his influence extending across literature, philosophy, and social reform movements.

### Literary Legacy and Influence on Korean Literature

Pak Ji-won is now recognized as a harbinger of Korean literary modernism, whose innovations in the eighteenth century anticipated developments that would fully emerge in the twentieth century.[^78] His approach of making marginal social figures the protagonists of sophisticated classical Chinese prose was "a revolution of sorts" that fundamentally expanded the boundaries of who and what could be considered worthy literary subjects.[^79]

According to scholar Emanuel Pastreich, Pak "turned to literature as the means to effectively influence people, and in that respect he was most successful. He continues to influence us today."[^80] His novels represented a critical first sprout of a new awareness of literature's potential in the late Joseon period, adumbrating the rise of realism in twentieth-century Korean literature.[^81]

Pak's writing style (Yeonamche) became so influential that it persisted long after his death, shaping generations of Korean writers who followed.[^82] Kim Taekyeong's *Selections from the Writings of Ten Great Masters of Korean Literature* (1850s) recognized Pak as an ancient literary scholar comparable to the Eight Great Prose Masters of Tang and Song China—an extraordinary acknowledgment of his literary stature.[^83]

### Philosophical and Intellectual Legacy

Pak Ji-won is regarded as one of the earliest advocates of modernization in Korea, whose thoughts on progress and social reforms inspired by knowledge of Western civilization (filtered through Qing China) had deep influence on later generations.[^84] As a representative scholar of Bukhak (Northern Learning) within Silhak, he helped establish an intellectual tradition that challenged Joseon orthodoxy and prepared the ground for the Gaehwa (Enlightenment) movement of the late nineteenth century.[^85]

The scholars Pak influenced—Pak Chega, Yu Deukgong, and Yi Deokmu—continued his reformist tradition and extended his ideas into new domains.[^86] His grandson Pak Gyu-su became a leading figure in the enlightenment faction, demonstrating how Pak's intellectual legacy transmitted both through students and family lines.[^87]

An expert argued that Pak's works constitute one of the three finest legacies of the Joseon era, alongside Admiral Yi Sun-sin's military tactics and the academic accomplishments of the great Neo-Confucian scholars Yi Hwang (Toegye) and Yi I (Yulgok)—placing him among the most important figures in Korean history.[^88]

### Collection and Preservation of His Works

Kim Taekyeong (1850-1927) undertook the crucial work of collecting Pak's writings and publishing *Yeonamjip* (Collected Works of Yeonam), *Yeonam Sokjip* (Sequel of Collected Works of Yeonam), and *Jeungpyeon Yeonamjip* (The Revised Edition of Collected Works of Yeonam), ensuring Pak's works were preserved for future generations.[^89] The comprehensive *Yeonamjip* was published in 1932 and reprinted in 1966, making Pak's complete works accessible to modern scholars and readers.[^90]

In recent decades, major translations have brought Pak's works to international audiences. Yang Hi Choe-Wall's English translation of the *Jehol Diary* and Emanuel Pastreich's *The Novels of Park Jiwon: Translation of Overlooked Worlds* have introduced this eighteenth-century Korean genius to global readership, demonstrating his enduring relevance.[^91]

### Modern Assessment and Contemporary Relevance

Modern scholars recognize that Pak's literary works, though considered sensational in the past, remain relevant and worthwhile reading today because of his reform-minded and visionary thoughts.[^92] His critiques of social inequality, parasitic elites, economic stagnation, and resistance to practical reforms resonate with contemporary concerns about social justice and effective governance.

Pak's experimental thinking and Daoist influences have attracted scholarly attention as scholars explore the complexity of his philosophical synthesis beyond simple categorization as a Confucian reformer.[^93] His willingness to integrate insights from multiple intellectual traditions—Confucianism, Daoism, empirical science, and practical statecraft—exemplifies intellectual flexibility increasingly valued in our interconnected world.

The title "The loneliness of those who are ahead of their time" applied to Pak by *The Korea Herald* captures both the isolation he experienced during his lifetime and the vindication his ideas eventually received.[^94] Like many visionaries, Pak was misunderstood and marginalized by his contemporaries but celebrated by subsequent generations who recognized his prescience.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessment of Pak Ji-won has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding his literary innovations and reformist vision. Kim Taekyeong's recognition of Pak as comparable to the Eight Great Prose Masters of Tang and Song China represented an early acknowledgment of his extraordinary literary achievement.[^95] This comparison placed Pak among the greatest prose writers in the entire East Asian literary tradition, not merely Korean literature.

Modern literary scholars praise Pak's revolutionary approach to making marginal social figures literary protagonists. As one academic analysis noted, employing "the approach of writing in the most abstruse literary Chinese about the lives of ordinary people as a tool for making the experience of ordinary people visible to intellectuals of his age" was a significant experiment for the late eighteenth century.[^96] This innovation represented a critical first sprout of realist consciousness in Korean literature that would fully flower in the twentieth century.[^97]

Translator Emanuel Pastreich emphasizes Pak's genius for combining satire with empathy, using literature as a vessel for complex debates about ideology, economic systems, institutions, philosophy, and psychology.[^98] Pastreich finds Pak's work reminiscent of Montesquieu's *Persian Letters* (1721), though the comparison reveals Pak's unique complexity as a Korean writer working in literary Chinese.[^99] This cross-cultural comparison situates Pak within global Enlightenment-era intellectual movements.

Historians of Korean thought recognize Pak as one of the earliest advocates of modernization whose ideas on progress and social reform had deep influence on later generations.[^100] His role as a representative scholar of Bukhak (Northern Learning) helped establish an intellectual tradition that challenged ossified orthodoxy and created conceptual space for the Gaehwa enlightenment movement.[^101]

The assessment that Pak's works constitute one of the three finest legacies of the Joseon era—alongside Yi Sun-sin's military achievements and the philosophical accomplishments of Yi Hwang and Yi I—places him at the pinnacle of Korean cultural achievement.[^102] This evaluation acknowledges that Pak's contributions to literature, philosophy, and social thought equal the military genius of Korea's greatest admiral and the philosophical sophistication of its most celebrated Neo-Confucian thinkers.

Contemporary scholars emphasize Pak's continuing relevance. One noted that "his literary works may have been considered sensational in the past but are still relevant and worthwhile reading today because of his reform-minded and visionary thoughts."[^103] This enduring relevance distinguishes Pak from many historical figures whose ideas remain trapped in their historical context.

### Negative Views

While overwhelmingly celebrated, Pak Ji-won has faced some criticisms and limitations acknowledged by balanced historical assessment. Conservative Confucian scholars of his own era viewed him with deep suspicion, believing his praise of Qing Dynasty civilization represented ideological betrayal and cultural treason.[^104] From their perspective, Pak's willingness to acknowledge Manchu achievements violated Joseon's commitment to Ming legitimacy and Confucian cultural purity.[^105]

King Jeongjo's expressed concern about the prevalence of Pak's writing style suggests that even relatively progressive monarchs found his influence potentially destabilizing.[^106] The king's ambivalence reveals the threatening nature of Pak's ideas to established authority, even when that authority was relatively enlightened by Joseon standards.

Some modern critics note limitations in Pak's reformist vision. Despite his criticisms of yangban privilege and calls for eliminating class inequality, Pak remained embedded in yangban consciousness and did not advocate for complete social revolution.[^107] His reform proposals aimed to strengthen and modernize the existing state structure rather than fundamentally democratize power or abolish hierarchical social distinctions.

Pak's focus on learning from Qing China, while progressive in recognizing Chinese technological and commercial sophistication, remained fundamentally Sinocentric and did not extend to serious engagement with Western knowledge.[^108] This limitation meant that Pak's Northern Learning, despite its innovations, still operated within an East Asian cultural sphere that was increasingly peripheral to global centers of technological and economic dynamism.

His personal struggles with depression and examination failure, while humanizing, also represented a kind of professional failure. Unlike more successful contemporaries who navigated the system while pursuing private reforms, Pak's uncompromising intellectual honesty cost him decades of potential governmental influence.[^109] A more pragmatic approach might have allowed him to implement reforms from positions of greater authority, though it might also have compromised the radical clarity of his critiques.

Some scholars suggest that Pak's literary focus on satire and social criticism, while brilliant, lacked the systematic philosophical rigor of great Neo-Confucian synthesizers like Yi Hwang or Yi I.[^110] His strength lay in critical deconstruction rather than positive philosophical construction, leaving later thinkers to develop systematic alternatives to the orthodoxy he challenged.

> "Even if you work hard all year round, you will not be able to afford salt."

Pak quoted this farmer's lament in his land reform proposals to King Jeongjo, illustrating the fundamental injustice of Joseon's economic system that left agricultural workers impoverished despite their labor.[^112]

> "To take the highest form of literary Chinese and use it to articulate the words of a beggar, that was shocking."

Though describing rather than directly quoting Pak, this statement from translator Emanuel Pastreich perfectly encapsulates Pak's revolutionary literary approach of using elite classical language to give voice to society's marginalized.[^113]

> "Korean potters strip the landscape bare of pine forests in their insatiable use of fuel."

Pak's environmental observation in the *Jehol Diary* demonstrated his holistic awareness of sustainability issues and economic practices' ecological consequences—remarkably prescient for the eighteenth century.[^114]

> "Farmers said 'Even if you work hard all year round, you will not be able to afford salt.'"

From Pak's agricultural reform proposals, this quotation of peasant hardship illustrated his concern for ordinary people's welfare and his empirical approach of listening to actual farmers rather than relying solely on classical texts.[^115]
