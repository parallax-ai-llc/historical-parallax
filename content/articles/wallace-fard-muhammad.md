## Summary

Wallace Fard Muhammad was the mysterious founder of the Nation of Islam who appeared in Detroit in 1930. He taught African Americans that they were descended from an original Black civilization and that white people were created by a scientist named Yakub. His movement combined elements of Islam, Black nationalism, and millenarianism. He disappeared in 1934, and his true identity and fate remain among the great mysteries of American religious history.
