## Overview

Alan Turing (1912–1954) was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and philosopher who is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. His 1936 paper introduced the "Turing Machine"—a conceptual model that could simulate any algorithm, forming the basis of all modern computers. During WWII, his genius saved millions of lives by cracking the Nazi Enigma code. Tragically, his country repaid him with prosecution for "gross indecency" (homosexuality), leading to his suicide at age 41.

## The Universal Turing Machine (1936)

Before computers existed physically, Turing invented them mathematically.
**The Question:** The *Entscheidungsproblem* (Decision Problem). Could a machine determine if any given mathematical statement is provable?
**The Solution:** Turing proved it couldn't. But in doing so, he imagined a hypothetical machine reading a tape of 0s and 1s. This "Universal Machine" could run any program.
**Significance:** Every smartphone, laptop, and server today is a realization of Turing's paper idea.

## Bletchley Park & Enigma

**The Problem:** The Germans used the **Enigma machine** to encrypt naval and army signals. It had 159 million million million possible settings, changing every day at midnight.
**The Bombe:**
Turing didn't just use logic; he built a machine. He designed the **Bombe**, an electromechanical device that searched through Enigma settings to find the key.
**The Impact:**
By 1943, Bletchley Park was cracking 84,000 messages a month.
Historians estimate this intelligence (**Ultra**) shortened the war in Europe by 2 to 4 years, saving approx. 14 million lives.
Turing specifically cracked the complex Naval Enigma, defeating the U-boat wolf packs in the Atlantic.

## Artificial Intelligence

In 1950, he published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence."
**The Turing Test:**
He proposed a game: Can a machine fool a human into thinking it is also human?
He famously asked, *"Can machines think?"*
He predicted that by the year 2000, machines would play the imitation game well enough to fool judges 30% of the time.

## Tragedy & Pardon

**1952:** Turing was burglary victim. He told police he had a relationship with a man (Arnold Murray).
**The Crime:** Homosexual acts were illegal in the UK. He was charged with "gross indecency" (same law as Oscar Wilde).
**The Sentence:** He was given a choice: Prison or chemical castration (estrogen injections). He chose castration to keep working.
**The End:**
The drugs caused him to grow breasts and become impotent. His security clearance was revoked.
On June 7, 1954, he was found dead with a half-eaten apple dipped in cyanide. (Rumored to be an homage to *Snow White*).
**Posthumous Pardon:**
In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a royal pardon. In 2021, he appeared on the £50 note.
