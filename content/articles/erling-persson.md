## Summary

Erling Persson founded Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) in 1947, creating what would become one of the world's largest fashion retailers. He was inspired by high-volume, low-price fashion stores he saw in the United States after WWII. Starting with women's clothing in Västerås, Sweden, he expanded across Scandinavia and eventually worldwide. His concept of democratizing fashion made trendy clothing affordable for everyone.
