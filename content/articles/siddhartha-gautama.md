## Summary

Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha (the Awakened One), was the founder of Buddhism. Born a prince of the Shakya clan, he renounced his privileged life to seek the cause of human suffering. After years of asceticism and meditation, he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree at Bodh Gaya. He taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path for 45 years, establishing a monastic community (Sangha) that spread across Asia.
