## Summary

Herman Melville (1819-1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet, best known for his masterpiece "Moby-Dick" (1851), a novel that is now considered one of the greatest works in Western literature. Despite achieving early literary success with adventure tales based on his experiences at sea, Melville's more ambitious and complex works were largely misunderstood and commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime. After the critical and financial failure of "Moby-Dick" and subsequent novels, he largely withdrew from the literary world, spending nearly two decades as a customs inspector in New York. His literary reputation was only restored decades after his death, when scholars rediscovered his work in the 1920s, recognizing him as a profound explorer of themes including obsession, good and evil, identity, and the human condition.

## Early Life and Background

Herman Melville was born on August 1, 1819, in New York City to Allan Melvill, a merchant, and Maria Gansevoort Melvill, daughter of a prominent Albany family.[^1] The family enjoyed relative prosperity during Herman's early childhood, living comfortably on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan. Young Herman attended the New York Male High School and later Columbia Grammar School, receiving a solid education typical of the merchant class.[^2]

However, the family's fortunes collapsed dramatically in 1830 when Allan Melvill's importing business failed, forcing the family to flee creditors and relocate to Albany.[^3] The trauma deepened in January 1832 when Herman's father died suddenly, possibly from exhaustion and stress, at age 49. Contemporary accounts suggest Allan Melvill died in a state of mental delirium, a fact that would later inform Herman's explorations of madness and obsession in his fiction.[^4] The family added an "e" to their surname around this time, becoming "Melville."

The family's sudden poverty had profound effects on young Herman. At age 12, he was forced to leave school and work as a clerk at the New York State Bank to help support his widowed mother and seven siblings.[^5] He later worked at his brother's fur and cap store and taught briefly at rural schools near Pittsfield, Massachusetts. These early experiences of financial insecurity, loss of status, and interrupted education would inform much of Melville's later writing, particularly his sympathy for common laborers and his critique of American capitalism.[^6]

In 1839, desperate for employment and adventure, the 20-year-old Melville signed on as a crew member aboard the merchant ship St. Lawrence, sailing to Liverpool, England. This four-month voyage introduced him to the brutal realities of maritime life and exposed him to Liverpool's devastating urban poverty, experiences he would later chronicle in his novel "Redburn" (1849).[^7]

## Rise to Prominence

Unable to find steady employment after returning from Liverpool, Melville made the fateful decision in January 1841 to sign aboard the whaling ship Acushnet, bound for the South Pacific.[^8] This voyage would fundamentally shape his life and literary career. After 18 months at sea in brutal conditions, Melville and a shipmate deserted in the Marquesas Islands in July 1842, where he spent approximately four weeks living among the Typee people in the Taipivai Valley.[^9]

This experience in Polynesia—whether Melville was held captive or stayed willingly remains debated—provided the material for his first novel. After escaping on an Australian whaler, serving briefly in the U.S. Navy, and finally returning to Boston in October 1844, Melville began writing about his adventures.[^10] His family and friends were captivated by his sea stories, encouraging him to put them on paper.

"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life" was published in 1846 to immediate success in both Britain and America. Critics praised its exotic adventure, romantic depictions of South Sea island life, and criticism of Christian missionaries.[^11] The book's sensual descriptions of Polynesian women and its anti-missionary stance generated controversy, which only increased sales. Melville suddenly found himself a literary celebrity, known as "the man who lived among cannibals."[^12]

He quickly capitalized on this success with a sequel, "Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas" (1847), which continued his South Pacific adventures and further criticized missionary colonialism. This book was equally successful, establishing Melville as America's leading writer of exotic adventure tales.[^13] In August 1847, riding high on his literary success, Melville married Elizabeth Shaw, daughter of Massachusetts Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, and settled in New York City to pursue a full-time writing career.[^14]

Melville published "Mardi: and a Voyage Thither" in 1849, a far more ambitious and philosophical work that departed from straightforward adventure narrative. The book's experimental style and allegorical complexity confused readers and critics, resulting in disappointing sales.[^15] This pattern—Melville's artistic ambitions outpacing his audience's expectations—would define the rest of his career.

---

## Major Achievements

Melville's supreme literary achievement is "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale," published in October 1851. The novel tells the story of Captain Ahab's obsessive quest to kill the white whale that destroyed his ship and severed his leg, narrated by the philosophical sailor Ishmael.[^16] The book is simultaneously an adventure story, an encyclopedia of whaling, a philosophical meditation on good and evil, a critique of American expansion and capitalism, and an exploration of human obsession and fate.

The novel's innovative structure combines narrative action with chapters on cetology (whale science), philosophical digressions, dramatic soliloquies resembling Shakespearean tragedy, and meditations on art, nature, and meaning.[^17] Melville's prose ranges from technical whaling descriptions to soaring poetic passages, creating a unique literary hybrid that defied conventional genre categories. The famous opening line—"Call me Ishmael"—has become one of the most recognizable in American literature.[^18]

Though "Moby-Dick" received mixed reviews and sold poorly during Melville's lifetime (about 3,200 copies in its first 40 years), it is now universally recognized as a masterpiece of world literature.[^19] The novel has been analyzed through virtually every critical lens—psychoanalytic, Marxist, postcolonial, environmental, queer theory—demonstrating its remarkable depth and complexity. Scholars have identified layers of biblical allegory, American political commentary, and universal human themes in the text.[^20]

Melville's short fiction, particularly "Bartleby, the Scrivener" (1853) and "Benito Cereno" (1855), represents another major achievement. "Bartleby," with its protagonist's enigmatic refrain "I would prefer not to," has become a touchstone for discussions of passive resistance, capitalism's dehumanization, and existential alienation.[^21] The story's ambiguity and its portrait of Wall Street's soul-crushing routine remain powerfully relevant. "Benito Cereno," based on a real 1799 slave revolt, explores themes of slavery, moral blindness, and the unreliability of perception through its tale of deception aboard a ship.[^22]

"Billy Budd, Sailor," Melville's final work of fiction, remained unpublished at his death and wasn't discovered until the 1920s. The novella tells the story of a handsome, innocent sailor falsely accused of mutiny who strikes and kills his accuser, leading to his execution.[^23] The work explores justice, innocence, authority, and moral ambiguity with a restraint and classical balance that differs markedly from "Moby-Dick's" expansiveness. Many scholars consider it Melville's most perfectly crafted narrative.[^24]

Melville's poetry, long neglected, has gained increasing recognition. "Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War" (1866), his collection of Civil War poems, offers complex, morally ambiguous meditations on that conflict, refusing simplistic patriotic celebration.[^25] His late poetry collection "Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land" (1876), an 18,000-line philosophical poem about faith and doubt, demonstrates his sustained engagement with religious and metaphysical questions.[^26]

Beyond individual works, Melville pioneered what became American literature's characteristic themes and techniques: the symbolic use of nature, the exploration of racial dynamics and democracy, the questioning of religious certainty, the creation of distinctly American mythologies, and the development of a vernacular yet elevated prose style.[^27] His influence extends through American literature from Faulkner and Morrison to Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy.

## Controversies and Criticisms

During his lifetime, Melville's greatest "controversy" was his perceived failure and artistic decline. After the commercial disappointment of "Moby-Dick," which earned him just $1,260, and the even greater failure of "Pierre; or, The Ambiguities" (1852), critics turned hostile.[^28] "Pierre," a dark, psychologically complex novel touching on incest and moral hypocrisy, was condemned as "immoral," "insane," and "unreadable."[^29] Contemporary reviewers openly questioned Melville's mental stability, with one suggesting he belonged in an asylum rather than the literary marketplace.[^30]

This critical rejection deeply wounded Melville and effectively ended his career as a commercially viable novelist. His subsequent novels "Israel Potter" (1855), "The Confidence-Man" (1857), were largely ignored. By age 38, Melville had essentially been rejected by the literary establishment and reading public.[^31] This failure stemmed partly from his refusal to continue writing the simple adventure tales his audience wanted, instead pursuing increasingly complex philosophical and psychological themes that mid-19th-century readers found difficult or disturbing.[^32]

Melville's personal life also attracted criticism and speculation. He suffered from what contemporaries called "nervous conditions" and what modern scholars interpret as depression, possibly manic depression.[^33] His wife Elizabeth's family at one point considered him mentally unstable and allegedly discussed plans for her to separate from him, though she never did.[^34] Biographers have documented Melville's heavy drinking and volatile temperament, which created domestic tensions.[^35]

The tragic death of Melville's eldest son Malcolm in 1867 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at age 18 raised questions about Melville's parenting, though the death was ruled accidental.[^36] His younger son Stanwix led an unsuccessful, wandering life and died at 35, suggesting possible family dysfunction, though poverty and Melville's literary failure likely contributed to these tragedies.[^37]

Some Victorian critics found Melville's depictions of male physical intimacy and his romanticization of Polynesian life morally questionable. "Typee" was criticized for its sensual descriptions and perceived endorsement of "primitive" life over Christian civilization.[^38] Modern scholars have extensively debated the homoerotic elements in Melville's work, particularly the relationship between Ishmael and Queequeg in "Moby-Dick," though evidence about Melville's own sexuality remains ambiguous and contested.[^39]

Melville's harsh criticism of Christian missionaries in the Pacific, while now often viewed as prescient anti-colonial critique, was controversial in his time. Religious publications condemned his portrayal of missionaries as hypocritical, cruel, and destructive to indigenous cultures.[^40] His broader questioning of religious certainty and conventional morality troubled many 19th-century readers seeking moral clarity from literature.

From a literary perspective, critics have noted Melville's uneven writing quality, with brilliant passages alongside verbose, self-indulgent sections. Even admirers acknowledge that works like "Mardi" and "Pierre" suffer from structural problems and tonal inconsistencies.[^41] His tendency toward philosophical digression frustrated readers expecting conventional storytelling. Some scholars argue he never fully mastered novelistic form, instead creating sui generis hybrids that resist categorization.[^42]

## Personal Life

Herman Melville married Elizabeth "Lizzie" Shaw on August 4, 1847, shortly after his early literary successes. Elizabeth was the only daughter of Lemuel Shaw, Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and a family friend.[^43] The marriage produced four children: Malcolm (1849-1867), Stanwix (1851-1886), Elizabeth (1853-1908), and Frances (1855-1938). While the marriage lasted until Melville's death in 1891, it appears to have been strained and possibly unhappy, particularly during the difficult years following his literary failures.[^44]

Elizabeth bore the burden of Melville's financial failures, mood swings, and possible mental instability. Her family correspondence reveals concerns about Herman's temperament and her own unhappiness, though she remained loyal and never publicly criticized him.[^45] The couple's relationship stabilized somewhat in later years, particularly after Melville secured steady employment as a customs inspector, though emotional distance apparently remained.[^46]

Melville's most significant literary friendship was with Nathaniel Hawthorne, whom he met in August 1850 in the Berkshires of Massachusetts.[^47] This relationship profoundly influenced Melville during the composition of "Moby-Dick," which he dedicated to Hawthorne. Melville's letters to Hawthorne are among his most revealing writings, expressing deep intellectual and emotional connection in language some scholars interpret as romantic or homoerotic.[^48] However, Hawthorne, more reserved and conventional, appears to have been uncomfortable with Melville's intensity, and their friendship cooled by 1852.[^49]

In 1850, using borrowed money, Melville purchased Arrowhead, a farm near Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he lived with his extended family while writing his greatest works.[^50] Financial pressures forced him to sell the property in 1863, moving back to New York City. From 1866 until 1885, Melville worked as a customs inspector at the New York docks, a humble position for someone who had once been a celebrated author.[^51] This stable but unglamorous employment provided necessary income and allowed him to write in his spare time without commercial pressure.

Melville was described by contemporaries as intellectually intense, moody, and often withdrawn. He was a voracious reader, accumulating a substantial library and marking his books extensively with annotations that reveal his thinking.[^52] He studied Shakespeare, the Bible, philosophy, and contemporary literature deeply, incorporating these influences into his work. In his later years, he became increasingly reclusive, writing poetry for private satisfaction rather than publication.[^53]

The deaths of his sons Malcolm and Stanwix were devastating blows. Malcolm's death in 1867, potentially a suicide though ruled accidental, occurred during a period of significant family tension.[^54] Stanwix's death in San Francisco in 1886, after years of wandering and failure to establish himself, added to Melville's grief.[^55] His daughters remained closer, with Elizabeth living at home and Frances marrying. Melville developed a particularly affectionate relationship with his granddaughter Eleanor, to whom he told stories in his final years.[^56]

## Legacy

Herman Melville died on September 28, 1891, in near-total obscurity. The New York Times obituary contained factual errors and described him primarily as a former customs official who had once written popular sea tales.[^57] His books were mostly out of print, and he was largely forgotten by the literary establishment. At his death, Melville left behind the manuscript of "Billy Budd," unpublished and unknown to the world.[^58]

The "Melville Revival" began in the 1920s, driven by modernist writers and scholars who recognized in his work a complexity and experimentation that aligned with modernist aesthetics.[^59] Raymond Weaver's 1921 biography and his discovery and publication of "Billy Budd" sparked renewed interest. By the 1920s and 1930s, critics like Lewis Mumford, F.O. Matthiessen, and others championed Melville as a major American literary figure.[^60] The centennial of "Moby-Dick" in 1951 solidified his canonical status.

Today, Melville is universally recognized as one of the greatest American writers. "Moby-Dick" regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest novels in English, alongside works by Shakespeare, Joyce, and Tolstoy.[^61] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages and has never been out of print since the revival began. It is a staple of high school and university curricula worldwide, introducing millions of readers to Melville's prose and themes.[^62]

Melville's influence on American and world literature is immeasurable. Writers from William Faulkner to Toni Morrison, Thomas Pynchon to Cormac McCarthy have acknowledged his impact.[^63] His techniques—symbolic layering, philosophical digression, unreliable narration, generic hybridity—became fundamental to modern and postmodern fiction. His exploration of American identity, race, democracy, and capitalism established themes that subsequent American writers continue to engage.[^64]

Beyond literature, Melville's work has influenced film, with numerous adaptations of "Moby-Dick" and other works, though none has fully captured the novel's complexity.[^65] John Huston's 1956 film starring Gregory Peck remains the best-known adaptation. The white whale has become a cultural symbol for obsessive quests and unattainable goals, entering the language as a metaphor.

Academic Melville studies constitute a substantial scholarly industry, with dedicated journals, societies, and conferences. The Melville Society, founded in 1945, continues to promote scholarship and appreciation of his work.[^66] Northwestern University's critical edition of his complete works represents decades of textual scholarship. New critical approaches—postcolonial, ecocritical, queer theory, disability studies—continue to find new dimensions in his texts.[^67]

Melville's home Arrowhead in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he wrote "Moby-Dick," is now a museum dedicated to his life and work, attracting thousands of visitors annually.[^68] The Herman Melville Society maintains an active online presence, and annual Moby-Dick Marathon readings occur around the world, with participants reading the entire novel aloud over 24 hours.[^69]

His legacy extends to environmental literature and ocean conservation. "Moby-Dick's" detailed cetology and complex portrayal of human-whale relationships has influenced environmental thinking about whales and oceans.[^70] As whales have transformed from commodities to objects of conservation, Melville's novel has been reread as an early environmental text warning against human exploitation of nature.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern literary scholarship overwhelmingly celebrates Melville as a visionary genius whose work transcended his time. F.O. Matthiessen's influential "American Renaissance" (1941) positioned Melville alongside Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Whitman as central to American literature's flowering.[^71] Critics praise his ambitious attempt to create a uniquely American epic that could rival European literary achievements while addressing distinctly American themes of democracy, race, and individualism.[^72]

Scholars particularly admire Melville's stylistic experimentation and formal innovation. "Moby-Dick's" hybrid structure—combining adventure narrative, cetological encyclopedia, philosophical essay, dramatic script, and poetic meditation—has been celebrated as anticipating modernist and postmodernist literary techniques.[^73] His willingness to violate conventional expectations and create new literary forms marks him as a true innovator who expanded what novels could achieve.

His treatment of race and colonialism has earned praise from postcolonial scholars. Unlike most white American writers of his era, Melville created complex non-white characters like Queequeg and depicted cross-racial friendships with genuine affection and equality.[^74] His criticism of missionary colonialism and American expansion, particularly in "Typee," "Omoo," and "Benito Cereno," demonstrated a critique of imperialism unusual for his time. While not free from racial stereotypes, his work showed progressive racial attitudes relative to his contemporaries.[^75]

Melville's philosophical depth continues to attract scholarly attention. His engagement with questions of free will versus determinism, the nature of evil, the limits of human knowledge, and the possibility of meaning in an indifferent universe places him in dialogue with major philosophical traditions.[^76] His refusal to provide easy moral answers and his embrace of ambiguity and contradiction mark him as a sophisticated thinker exploring modernity's deepest anxieties.

Environmental and oceanic scholars celebrate his detailed knowledge of whaling and marine ecosystems, his respect for the ocean's power and mystery, and his complex portrayal of human-animal relationships.[^77] "Moby-Dick" has been reread as an early environmental text that questions human dominion over nature and recognizes the whale's autonomous existence beyond human uses.

Writers consistently praise Melville's courage in pursuing artistic vision over commercial success. His willingness to write difficult, challenging books despite financial pressure and critical rejection has made him a model of artistic integrity.[^78] His journey from popular success to obscurity to posthumous recognition offers inspiration to artists working against prevailing tastes.

### Negative Views

Despite his canonical status, Melville has faced significant criticism. Some scholars and readers find his prose excessively verbose, digressive, and self-indulgent.[^79] "Moby-Dick's" cetological chapters, while praised by some as innovative, are criticized by others as tedious interruptions that halt narrative momentum. Even admirers acknowledge that Melville's ambition sometimes exceeded his execution, resulting in structural problems and tonal inconsistencies.[^80]

Feminist critics have noted the almost complete absence of developed female characters in Melville's work. His fiction predominantly features male homosocial worlds—ships, military vessels, offices—with women relegated to brief appearances or allegorical functions.[^81] This exclusion limits his exploration of human experience and reflects the gender biases of his era, though some feminist scholars have found value in his portrayal of male vulnerability and emotional expression.[^82]

While progressive on race compared to many contemporaries, Melville's work still contains racial stereotypes and ethnocentric assumptions that trouble modern readers. His romanticization of "primitive" Polynesian life, while critiquing Western colonialism, also exoticizes and simplifies indigenous cultures.[^83] Characters like Queequeg, though portrayed sympathetically, are also marked by racial stereotypes and serve partly as foils for white characters' development rather than existing as fully autonomous subjects.[^84]

Some critics argue that Melville's pessimism and darkness can become oppressive and even nihilistic. His later works particularly offer bleak visions of human nature and social relations with little hope or redemption.[^85] "The Confidence-Man," his final novel, presents such a dark, misanthropic vision of American society that some readers find it emotionally punishing rather than illuminating.

Conservative critics have occasionally challenged Melville's canonical status, arguing that his difficulty makes him more admired than read, a writer studied out of obligation rather than pleasure.[^86] They suggest that his cult status reflects academic investment in difficulty and obscurity rather than genuine literary merit or reader engagement. Popular reader reviews often note struggling to finish "Moby-Dick" despite its reputation.[^87]

His biography has drawn criticism for personal failings—his apparent neglect or harsh treatment of his family, his inability to provide financially, his possible alcoholism and mental instability.[^88] While these personal struggles don't diminish his literary achievement, they complicate romanticized portraits of the struggling artist and raise questions about the human cost of artistic ambition.

Finally, some scholars question whether Melville's work has been over-read, with critics finding meanings and complexities he never intended. The proliferation of wildly different interpretations—Melville as Christian allegorist, existentialist, Marxist critic, queer theorist, environmental prophet—raises questions about whether his ambiguity reflects profound complexity or merely confusion and lack of clear intention.[^89]
