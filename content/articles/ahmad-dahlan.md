## Summary

Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan (born Muhammad Darwis; 1 August 1868 – 23 February 1923) was an Indonesian Muslim religious leader, revivalist, and reformer who established Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations in Indonesia.[^1] Born into a prestigious religious family in Yogyakarta as a descendant of Maulana Malik Ibrahim of the Wali Sanga, Dahlan pioneered Islamic modernism by advocating for purification of Islamic practices from syncretic Javanese traditions and promoting the integration of religious and secular education.[^2] Through Muhammadiyah, founded in 1912, he created a vast network of schools, hospitals, and social institutions that transformed Indonesian society.[^3] Declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 1961, his legacy continues through Muhammadiyah's 29 million members and extensive educational and healthcare infrastructure.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ahmad Dahlan was born as Muhammad Darwis on 1 August 1868 in Kauman, the Muslim quarter of Yogyakarta, which was then under the rule of the Yogyakarta Sultanate during Dutch colonial occupation.[^5] He was the fourth child among seven children born to Kyai Haji Abu Bakr bin Sulaiman and Siti Aminah.[^6] His father held the prestigious position of Ketib, serving as a palace Muslim cleric and imam at the Kauman Great Mosque, while also working as a successful batik merchant.[^7] His mother, Siti Aminah, came from an educated family, providing young Muhammad Darwis with an intellectually stimulating home environment.[^8]

Muhammad Darwis came from an illustrious religious lineage, being the 12th generation descendant of Maulana Malik Ibrahim, better known as Sunan Gresik, one of the revered Wali Sanga (Nine Saints) who pioneered the spread of Islam in Java, with ancestry tracing back to the Prophet Muhammad himself.[^9] This distinguished heritage profoundly influenced his religious identity and sense of mission.[^10]

He was raised in the Kauman area and received his initial education directly from his parents in a family environment steeped in religious learning, where he was educated on matters of religion and the Quran from an early age.[^11] This solid foundation allowed Ahmad Dahlan to explore Islamic knowledge deeply during his formative years.[^12] The financial support provided by his parents enabled him to fuel his passion for learning, purchasing numerous books and embarking on journeys to various places to seek knowledge from renowned scholars.[^13]

Young Kiai Dahlan's curiosity extended far beyond religious studies alone. Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, he delved into diverse subjects, even studying poisons and snakes, demonstrating an intellectual breadth unusual for religious scholars of his era.[^14] He began formal studies at the Kauman boarding school at age 10, where he immersed himself in traditional Islamic education.[^15]

In 1883, at the remarkable age of 15, Muhammad Darwis performed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, where he would remain for five years.[^16] This transformative period proved crucial in shaping his reformist vision. During these years in the holy city, he studied various Islamic religious jurisprudence including qiraat (Quranic recitation), tafsir (Quranic exegesis), tawhid (Islamic theology), fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and tasawuf (Sufism).[^17] More significantly, he became the student of Ahmad Khatib Al-Minangkabawi, an imam at Masjid al-Haram who was also the teacher of other prominent Indonesian Islamic figures including Hasyim Asy'ari, who would later found Nahdlatul Ulama.[^18]

During his stay in Mecca, Muhammad Darwis became deeply involved with reformist thought within Islam, encountering the revolutionary ideas of modernist thinkers such as Muhammad Abduh, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Rashid Rida, and Ibn Taymiyyah.[^19] These intellectual encounters exposed him to critiques of traditional practices and emphasis on returning to core Quranic and prophetic sources, ideas that would fundamentally shape his future mission.[^20] He collected numerous religious books during this period, building an impressive personal library that would serve his scholarly pursuits.[^21]

## Rise to Power

Ahmad Dahlan returned to Indonesia in 1888, having undergone a profound intellectual and spiritual transformation during his years in Mecca.[^22] Upon his return, he changed his name from Muhammad Darwis to Ahmad Dahlan, signaling his new identity and mission.[^23] After returning to Java, he married Siti Walidah, the daughter of the imam of the Great Mosque in Yogyakarta, in 1889 when she was seventeen years old and he was twenty.[^24] Siti Walidah, also known as Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, was recognized as a highly intelligent woman who would become his most important partner in establishing the reform movement.[^25]

In 1903, Ahmad Dahlan embarked on a second pilgrimage to Mecca to further deepen his religious knowledge, remaining there for two years before returning to Indonesia in 1905.[^26] This second sojourn reinforced his commitment to Islamic reform and modernization, providing him with additional exposure to the evolving currents of Islamic modernist thought sweeping through the Middle East.[^27]

Two years after his return, in 1907, Ahmad Dahlan joined Budi Utomo, one of the first Indonesian nationalist organizations, founded on May 20, 1908, which marked the beginning of the Indonesian National Awakening.[^28] Though Budi Utomo was primarily a Javanese cultural and educational organization rather than a mass political movement, Ahmad Dahlan's involvement demonstrated his growing awareness of the need for social reform and national consciousness.[^29] However, he would soon determine that religious reform was the foundation necessary for broader social transformation.

As a court official (ketib) of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, Ahmad Dahlan occupied a position of respect within traditional Javanese society.[^30] Yet his exposure to reformist Islam created increasing tension between his role within the established religious hierarchy and his vision for purifying and modernizing Indonesian Islamic practice. He began advocating for changes to prayer practices, arguing for straight prayer rows without the mystical embellishments common in Javanese tradition.[^31]

His early reform efforts in Kauman, Yogyakarta, where he advocated for purifying Islamic practices from what he viewed as innovations (bid'ah), superstitions (khurafat), and syncretic elements inherent in Javanese traditions, provoked significant opposition from traditional ulama.[^32] This opposition culminated in physical retaliation, including the demolition in the 1910s of a mosque linked to his early preaching efforts in Kauman.[^33] Despite this hostility, Ahmad Dahlan remained steadfast in his conviction that Indonesian Islam required fundamental reform.

Recognizing that piecemeal efforts would prove insufficient, Ahmad Dahlan determined to establish an organization that could systematically implement his reformist vision. On November 18, 1912, in Yogyakarta, he formally founded Muhammadiyah, initially conceived as an educational organization and vehicle for realizing his reformist ideals.[^34] The name "Muhammadiyah" means "followers of Muhammad," emphasizing the organization's commitment to returning to the pure teachings of the Prophet.[^35]

The organization was quickly joined by traders, craftsmen, and merchants, who formed the initial core of supporters drawn to Ahmad Dahlan's vision of a purified, rationalized, and socially engaged Islam.[^36] Unlike traditional pesantren education, which focused exclusively on religious subjects and often incorporated Sufi practices and local customs, Muhammadiyah schools would integrate religious and secular education, preparing students for both spiritual development and modern life.[^37]

## Major Achievements

### Founding and Expansion of Muhammadiyah

Ahmad Dahlan's most significant achievement was the creation and development of Muhammadiyah as a comprehensive socio-religious movement. Founded on November 18, 1912, Muhammadiyah represented a structured effort to purify Indonesian Islam from syncretic practices, superstitions, and un-Islamic customs, emphasizing a direct return to the Quran and Sunnah as primary sources of faith.[^38] The organization was established as a reformist socioreligious movement, advocating ijtihad—individual interpretation of Quran and Sunnah—as opposed to taqlid, blind conformity to the traditional interpretations propounded by the ulama.[^39]

From its inception, Muhammadiyah experienced remarkable growth. Between 1913 and 1918, the organization established five Islamic schools.[^40] By 1925, just two years after Ahmad Dahlan's death, Muhammadiyah had built 55 schools across Java and beyond.[^41] By the 1930s, it had established branches throughout Indonesia, far beyond its Javanese origins.[^42] Today, Muhammadiyah operates 440 Islamic boarding schools, 20,233 kindergartens, 2,817 elementary schools, 1,817 junior high schools, 1,364 senior high schools, and 163 universities.[^43] The movement has extended its reach to over 30 countries, establishing a university in Malaysia and schools in Australia and other nations.[^44]

### Educational Reform and Integration

Ahmad Dahlan revolutionized Islamic education in Indonesia by uniting traditional-based education systems with modern education systems, collaborating religious sciences with general sciences, and integrating Islamic religious education with general education across aspects of curriculum, methods, and institutions.[^45] He introduced an innovative educational model recognizing that traditional approaches were insufficient for preparing students to meet the demands of the modern world, believing comprehensive education should include both religious teachings and general knowledge to create well-rounded individuals.[^46]

He introduced modern teaching methods that encouraged critical thinking, understanding, and application of knowledge, believing students should not merely memorize facts but should understand concepts and apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems.[^47] This represented a radical departure from traditional Islamic education in Indonesia, which emphasized rote memorization and adherence to classical texts.[^48] Ahmad Dahlan explained that education encompasses the development of character and spirituality as well as the transfer of knowledge, putting forward concepts that were pragmatic, progressive, pedagogical, and social.[^49]

### The Theology of Al-Ma'un and Social Justice

Ahmad Dahlan's interpretation and implementation of Surah Al-Ma'un became the theological foundation for Muhammadiyah's social welfare activities.[^50] This short Quranic chapter begins with a powerful question: "Do you know who denies the religion?"—answering that religion is defined in practical terms, focusing on caring for orphans and the poor.[^51] Ahmad Dahlan took this message and used it as the foundation for a large social movement, developing what became known as the "Theology of Al-Ma'un," emphasizing the importance of doing good, caring for others, and making a positive contribution to society, especially by helping the vulnerable and marginalized.[^52]

He interpreted Al-Ma'un into three main activities: education, healthcare, and sponsorship of the poor, transforming religious understanding from mere sacred doctrines into cooperation for human liberation.[^53] Ahmad Dahlan believed the weak were not a burden on society but a group needing empowerment through real and meaningful action, deserving help rather than humiliation.[^54] For Ahmad Dahlan, religion was not just a set of beliefs but a source of inspiration for creating a more just and compassionate society.[^55]

This theology led to concrete social initiatives. Muhammadiyah founded schools in remote areas to provide education to marginalized communities, established hospitals to provide healthcare to all regardless of social status, and introduced numerous social and religious services to reach those in need.[^56] By 1925, Muhammadiyah had built two clinics in Surabaya and Yogyakarta.[^57] On February 15, 1923, just days before his death, Ahmad Dahlan oversaw the establishment of Muhammadiyah's inaugural clinic in Yogyakarta.[^58] Today, Muhammadiyah operates 126 hospitals and 562 orphanages across Indonesia.[^59]

### Women's Empowerment and Aisyiyah

In 1917, Ahmad Dahlan added a women's section to Muhammadiyah named Aisyiyah, which played a significant role in modernizing the life of Indonesian women.[^60] The organization evolved from the Sopo Tresno recitation association that Ahmad Dahlan and Siti Walidah had founded, which existed as a study group from 1914-1917 before becoming formalized.[^61] Aisyiyah was officially established on April 22, 1917 (27 Rajab 1335 H), with Nyai Ahmad Dahlan serving as its head.[^62]

Through Aisyiyah, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan founded girls' schools and dormitories, as well as literacy and Islamic education programs for women, and preached against forced marriage.[^63] She introduced the revolutionary thinking that women have the same rights to pursue knowledge as high as possible, pioneering the gender equality movement by establishing various educational institutions from 1914 onwards.[^64] The organization focused on education, health, welfare, and community empowerment, creating opportunities for women's participation in public life previously unavailable in traditional Javanese society.[^65]

### Promotion of Ijtihad and Rational Interpretation

Ahmad Dahlan's theological approach challenged entrenched traditionalism by promoting ijtihad (independent reasoning) and rational interpretation, positioning Muhammadiyah as a vehicle for modernist Islam that adapted core doctrines to modern societal demands without diluting theological essentials.[^66] Muhammadiyah created networks of modernist schools for girls and boys that combined both modern scientific education and religion, advocating for necessary legal reforms through Quran, Sunnah, and ijtihad.[^67]

This reformist approach, influenced by ideas from Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and Rashid Rida, shaped Dahlan's vision for a progressive, action-driven interpretation of Islam.[^68] He insisted on scriptural purity and direct engagement with primary Islamic sources rather than blind adherence to medieval jurisprudential schools, though critics argued this undermined the madhhab-based taqlid they upheld.[^69]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Challenge to Traditional Javanese Islam

Ahmad Dahlan was deeply concerned about the many Javanese practices that he believed were not justified by Islamic scripture, arguing for the creation of a renewed, purer Islam more in step with the modern world.[^70] He sought to free Javanese Islam from the mixture of adat (customs) and local beliefs, viewing the birth of Muhammadiyah as a response to "impurity" deeply rooted in society and cultivated by priyayi (Javanese aristocratic) culture.[^71]

He specifically targeted rituals such as slametan (communal feasts), tahlilan (recitations for the deceased), excessive grave visitations, and mourning observances on the seventh and fortieth days after death, arguing these deviated from core Quranic and prophetic teachings.[^72] Traditional scholars embedded in pesantren networks and accustomed to integrating local customs with Islam defended these as permissible cultural expressions that fostered community cohesion, viewing Dahlan's stance as an overly rigid importation of Arabian reformism that undermined indigenous religious harmony.[^73]

### Opposition from Traditional Ulama and Physical Retaliation

Ahmad Dahlan's advocacy for purifying Islamic practices from innovations (bid'ah), superstitions (khurafat), and syncretic elements provoked significant opposition from traditional ulama, particularly in the Kauman religious quarter of Yogyakarta.[^74] This opposition culminated in physical retaliation, including the demolition in the 1910s of a mosque linked to his early preaching efforts in Kauman, where he had advocated for reformed prayer styles with straight rows and without mystical embellishments.[^75]

Traditionalists contended these changes represented "modernist excesses," accusing Dahlan of cultural erasure and excessive rationalism that prioritized individual ijtihad over collective tradition, thereby risking schism within Indonesian Islam.[^76] Critics, often kyai aligned with abangan (syncretic) Muslim communities in Yogyakarta, argued that Dahlan's insistence on scriptural purity undermined the madhhab-based taqlid (imitation of juristic schools) they upheld, potentially eroding communal harmony.[^77]

### Founding of Nahdlatul Ulama as Opposition

The tensions created by Ahmad Dahlan's reforms foreshadowed the 1926 founding of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) by traditionalist kyai like K.H. Hasyim Asy'ari—ironically, a fellow student under Ahmad Khatib Al-Minangkabawi in Mecca—explicitly to safeguard customary practices against modernist encroachments like those Dahlan pioneered.[^78] Nahdlatul Ulama was founded specifically to preserve traditional Indonesian Islam against what they viewed as the conservative agenda of Muhammadiyah, creating a lasting tension between modernist and traditionalist Muslim organizations in Indonesia that persists today.[^79]

### Hostility Toward Pesantren and Sufism

Muhammadiyah's opposition to the pesantren was born not merely from their neglect of secular teaching but from hostility to the Sufism and local practices that were integral parts of pesantren education.[^80] This deep "Protestant" suspicion of traditionalist Islamic practices such as ziarah (making pilgrimages to tombs of saints) contributed to increasing antipathy toward classical Islamic scholarship.[^81] Critics charged that Muhammadiyah's inability to reproduce sophisticated religious thinkers resulted from this rejection of traditional Islamic educational methods and scholarly traditions.[^82]

### Social Tensions and Class Dimensions

Despite its positive role in Indonesian society, Muhammadiyah's hostility toward 'abangan' practices created tensions, making traditional ulama feel threatened by modernism.[^83] The organization's initial appeal to traders, craftsmen, and merchants rather than traditional religious scholars highlighted class dimensions of the conflict, with some viewing Muhammadiyah as a bourgeois movement disconnected from grassroots religious life.[^84]

### Accusations of Wahhabi Influence

Critics sometimes accused Ahmad Dahlan and Muhammadiyah of importing rigid Wahhabi ideology from Arabia, pointing to similarities between his rejection of saint veneration, tomb visitation, and elaborate mourning rituals and the austere practices advocated by Saudi reformers.[^85] While Ahmad Dahlan was influenced by Middle Eastern reformers like Muhammad Abduh, who themselves drew on Wahhabi-adjacent ideas, his approach was generally more moderate and adapted to Indonesian contexts than purist Wahhabi doctrine.[^86]

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Family

Ahmad Dahlan married Siti Walidah in 1889 when she was seventeen years old and he was twenty.[^87] Siti Walidah, known as Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, was recognized as a highly intelligent woman who became his most important partner in the reform movement and co-founder of Aisyiyah.[^88] She strongly supported Kiai Dahlan in founding and developing Muhammadiyah, playing a significant role in women's education and empowerment.[^89]

From his marriage with Siti Walidah, they had six children: Johanah (born 1890), Siradj Dahlan and Siti Busjro (born 1889 and 1903), Siti Aisyah (born 1905), Irfan Dahlan (born 1907), and Siti Zuharah (born 1908).[^90] Their partnership became legendary within Muhammadiyah, with Siti Walidah's contributions to women's empowerment being recognized when she was posthumously declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 1971.[^91]

Ahmad Dahlan practiced polygamy, having four wives in total.[^92] He married three other women for reasons related to Islamic outreach after establishing the Muhammadiyah organization.[^93] His second wife was R.A.Y. Soetidjah Windyaningrum (also known as Nyai Abdullah), whose marriage was requested by the Yogyakarta Palace; from this marriage he had one son named R. Dhurie, though this marriage ended in separation.[^94] His third wife was Ny Romiyah (known as Nyai Rum), the sister of KH Munawwir from Krapyak, a prominent Nahdlatul Ulama figure—a marriage that demonstrated his attempt to bridge the modernist-traditionalist divide.[^95]

### Character and Personality

Known as Ahmad Darwis in his youth, Dahlan displayed early signs of leadership and a compassionate nature.[^96] His intellectual curiosity extended far beyond religious studies, encompassing natural sciences and diverse fields of knowledge.[^97] Colleagues and students described him as a man of action rather than lengthy theoretical discourse, preferring practical implementation of Islamic principles to abstract theological debate.[^98]

Ahmad Dahlan is recognized not only as a revered Islamic scholar but as a man of action who left an enduring legacy through practical contributions rather than solely through written works.[^99] He emphasized sincerity (ikhlas) in all endeavors, famously stating: "Saya titipkan Muhammadiyah kepadamu. Hidup hidupilah Muhammadiyah, jangan mencari hidup di Muhammadiyah" (I entrust Muhammadiyah to you. Live for Muhammadiyah, don't seek a living from Muhammadiyah).[^100]

His teaching style emphasized dialogue over authoritarian pronouncement, recognizing that "Most people are arrogant and prideful, making decisions on their own," and thus seeking to engage rather than dictate.[^101] He taught that "Kasih sayang dan toleransi adalah kartu identitas orang Islam" (Love and tolerance are the identity card of Muslims), demonstrating a humanistic approach despite his uncompromising stance on doctrinal purity.[^102]

### Final Years and Death

Throughout the last year of his life in 1922-1923, Ahmad Dahlan suffered from several health issues.[^103] Following his doctor's advice, he took time to rest at Mount Tretes, Malang, East Java, seeking recuperation in the mountain air.[^104] Despite his deteriorating health, he returned to Yogyakarta to attend an annual Muhammadiyah meeting, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to the organization he had built.[^105]

On February 15, 1923, just eight days before his death, Ahmad Dahlan oversaw the establishment of Muhammadiyah's inaugural clinic in Yogyakarta, a final realization of his theology of Al-Ma'un.[^106] His health continued to deteriorate until he died on February 23, 1923, at age 54 in Yogyakarta.[^107] His death came at a time when Muhammadiyah was still in its formative stages, having been established only eleven years earlier.[^108]

## Legacy

### Institutional Impact

Ahmad Dahlan's most tangible legacy is the vast institutional network of Muhammadiyah, which has grown into one of the world's largest Islamic organizations. With approximately 29 million members as of 2008—and even higher estimates of up to 30 million by some sources—Muhammadiyah stands as Indonesia's second largest Muslim organization after Nahdlatul Ulama.[^109] The organization operates 440 Islamic boarding schools, over 20,000 kindergartens, thousands of elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, 163 universities, 126 hospitals, and 562 orphanages throughout Indonesia.[^110]

Muhammadiyah's rising influence in the modern context has been driven by an extensive network of activists and missionaries emphasizing moral and intellectual development, and it is widely held as one of the largest and most organized and systematic Islamic movements in the world.[^111] The movement has extended its reach to over 30 countries, establishing educational institutions internationally and creating a worldwide transformative model for Islamic reform.[^112]

### National Recognition

For his services to Indonesian society and nationalism, Ahmad Dahlan was inaugurated as a National Hero according to Presidential Decree No. 657 of 1961.[^113] President Sukarno remarked in his eulogy: "We know Kiyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan, not only as a founder and father of Muhammadiyah, but as one of the pioneers of freedom and Islamic reformism in Indonesia."[^114] This recognition acknowledged his role not only in religious reform but in the broader Indonesian National Awakening that laid foundations for independence.[^115]

The rise of numerous National Heroes from Muhammadiyah demonstrated his success in creating a movement that transcended his individual leadership.[^116] As of 2023, Indonesia has bestowed the title of National Hero on 206 people, including 23 or approximately 11% who are Muhammadiyah members—a disproportionately high representation given the organization's percentage of the Indonesian population.[^117] His wife, Siti Walidah (Nyai Ahmad Dahlan), was recognized as a National Hero in 1971, honoring her contributions to women's empowerment.[^118]

### Educational Philosophy and Reform

Ahmad Dahlan's educational philosophy transformed Islamic education in Indonesia by uniting traditional and modern education systems, integrating religious and secular knowledge, and emphasizing practical application alongside spiritual development.[^119] His efforts included advancing human resource development and promoting equal access to education, healthcare, and social services regardless of social class or gender.[^120] Academic assessments conclude that the thoughts of Ahmad Dahlan remain relevant and continue to influence Islamic education in the modern era.[^121]

He pioneered a modern, adaptive, dynamic, and progressive approach to Islamic thought that balanced religious authenticity with contemporary relevance.[^122] His vision of education as the primary tool to liberate Muslims from ignorance, backwardness, and social injustice, with educational approaches integrating religious and general sciences while providing practical skills relevant to societal needs, continues to guide Muhammadiyah institutions.[^123]

### Theological and Intellectual Legacy

Ahmad Dahlan contributed decisively to Islamic modernism in Indonesia by bringing into perspective the tawhidic (monotheistic) and puritanical aspects of Muhammadiyah that projected its modern and ethical tradition and consciousness.[^124] His promotion of ijtihad (independent reasoning) over taqlid (blind adherence to tradition) reshaped Indonesian Islamic thought, encouraging Muslims to engage directly with primary sources rather than rely exclusively on medieval jurisprudence.[^125]

His theology of Al-Ma'un transformed abstract Quranic teachings into tangible social action, establishing a model for socially engaged Islam that addresses contemporary social justice issues.[^126] Research implications demonstrate the relevance of Dahlan's reformist ideology in contemporary contexts, including education, interfaith dialogue, and social development.[^127]

### Impact on Women's Empowerment

Through the establishment of Aisyiyah in 1917, Ahmad Dahlan created lasting infrastructure for women's education and participation in public religious life.[^128] This pioneering effort in gender equality opened opportunities for Indonesian Muslim women to pursue education, professional careers, and religious leadership roles previously unavailable in traditional society.[^129] Today, Aisyiyah continues as a major force for women's empowerment in Indonesia and has expanded internationally.[^130]

### Shaping Religious Pluralism in Indonesia

Ahmad Dahlan's founding of Muhammadiyah inadvertently contributed to Indonesian Islamic pluralism by creating an alternative to traditionalist Islam represented by Nahdlatul Ulama.[^131] While this division created tensions, it also established a pattern of multiple legitimate Islamic organizations coexisting, preventing any single interpretation from monopolizing Indonesian Muslim identity.[^132] This pluralism within Indonesian Islam has been credited with promoting moderation and preventing extremism from dominating the Muslim community.[^133]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic scholarship overwhelmingly recognizes Ahmad Dahlan as a pivotal figure in Indonesian Islamic modernization and social development. Scholars examine his contributions to Islamic reform in Indonesia, focusing on his role in modernizing Islamic education, promoting social justice, and transforming theological practice through the establishment of Muhammadiyah.[^134] His efforts to renew Islamic education by uniting traditional and modern systems, collaborating religious and general sciences, and integrating comprehensive educational approaches across curriculum, methods, and institutions are viewed as groundbreaking achievements.[^135]

Researchers highlight Muhammadiyah's successful integration of secular and religious education, its emphasis on social justice through Surah Al-Ma'un, and gender inclusivity via Aisyiyah as pioneering accomplishments that addressed critical social needs.[^136] His educational philosophy, which encompassed character development and spirituality alongside knowledge transfer, and which put forward pragmatic, progressive, pedagogical, and social concepts, is recognized for its sophisticated understanding of holistic education.[^137]

Scholars credit Ahmad Dahlan with viewing education as the primary tool to liberate Muslims from ignorance, backwardness, and social injustice, with educational approaches integrating religious and general sciences while providing practical skills relevant to societal needs.[^138] His promotion of ijtihad and rational interpretation as vehicles for modernist Islam that adapted core doctrines to modern societal demands without diluting theological essentials is seen as a balanced approach to religious reform.[^139]

Contemporary assessments conclude that Ahmad Dahlan's thoughts remain relevant and continue to influence Islamic education and social practice in the modern era, with comprehensive analysis demonstrating the applicability of his reformist ideology to contemporary contexts including education, interfaith dialogue, and social development.[^140] His legacy is characterized as fundamentally transforming Indonesian Islam through educational modernization, social reform, and creating one of the world's largest and most organized Islamic organizations.[^141]

Supporters praise his humanistic approach, noting his teaching that "Love and tolerance are the identity card of Muslims" and his emphasis on dialogue and compassionate engagement.[^142] His theology of Al-Ma'un is celebrated for transforming abstract religious concepts into concrete social action addressing poverty, health, and education.[^143] The establishment of extensive healthcare infrastructure, educational institutions, and social services is viewed as exemplifying authentic Islamic values of charity and social responsibility.[^144]

### Negative Views

Critics and traditionalist scholars have consistently challenged Ahmad Dahlan's approach to Islamic reform, viewing it as culturally destructive and theologically problematic. Traditional ulama, particularly those associated with Nahdlatul Ulama, argue that his advocacy for purifying Islamic practices from innovations (bid'ah), superstitions (khurafat), and syncretic elements represented an assault on Indonesian Islamic identity and cultural heritage.[^145]

Traditionalists contend that Dahlan's changes represented "modernist excesses," accusing him of cultural erasure and excessive rationalism that prioritized individual ijtihad over collective tradition, thereby risking schism within Indonesian Islam.[^146] They defend practices like slametan (communal feasts), tahlilan (recitations for the deceased), grave visitations, and elaborate mourning rituals as permissible cultural expressions fostering community cohesion, viewing Dahlan's stance as an overly rigid importation of Arabian reformism that undermined indigenous religious harmony.[^147]

Traditional scholars embedded in pesantren networks argue that integration of local customs with Islam creates meaningful religious experience rooted in Indonesian culture, and that Dahlan's scriptural purism disconnects Islam from lived cultural reality.[^148] They charge that his insistence on scriptural purity undermined the madhhab-based taqlid (adherence to established jurisprudential schools) that provided stability and prevented religious chaos, potentially eroding communal harmony through excessive individualism in religious interpretation.[^149]

Critics point to Muhammadiyah's "inability to reproduce sophisticated religious thinkers" as evidence that rejection of traditional Islamic educational methods and classical scholarship produces shallow understanding of Islamic tradition.[^150] They argue that the organization's deep "Protestant" suspicion of traditionalist practices such as ziarah (saint veneration) and its hostility toward Sufism demonstrate intellectual narrowness and spiritual poverty.[^151]

Some scholars view Ahmad Dahlan's reforms as class-based rather than purely theological, noting Muhammadiyah's initial appeal to traders, craftsmen, and merchants rather than traditional religious scholars, suggesting it represented bourgeois interests rather than authentic religious reformation.[^152] Critics contend that modernist Islam serves commercial and professional classes seeking to shed traditional obligations and communal responsibilities in favor of individualistic interpretations compatible with capitalist modernity.[^153]

Opponents sometimes accuse Ahmad Dahlan of importing rigid Wahhabi ideology from Arabia, arguing that his rejection of saint veneration, tomb visitation, and elaborate rituals mirrors Saudi reformist movements that have destroyed cultural heritage and promoted intolerance.[^154] While scholars note that Dahlan's influences were more diverse and moderate than pure Wahhabism, critics maintain that the practical effects—rejection of traditional practices, hostility toward Sufism, emphasis on scriptural literalism—parallel problematic aspects of Wahhabi thought.[^155]

The physical opposition to his early reforms, including the demolition of a mosque linked to his preaching, is interpreted by some not as reactionary intolerance but as legitimate community self-defense against destabilizing innovations.[^156] From this perspective, traditional communities reasonably resisted impositions that threatened social cohesion and cultural continuity.[^157]
