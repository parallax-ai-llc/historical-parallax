## Summary

Huineng was the Sixth Patriarch of Chan (Zen) Buddhism and the most important figure in the development of Chan Buddhism in China. His Platform Sutra is the only Chinese Buddhist text to be called a 'sutra.' He emphasized sudden enlightenment over gradual cultivation, defining the Southern School of Chan that became dominant. His teaching that enlightenment was accessible to all, regardless of education or status, democratized Chinese Buddhism.
