## Summary

Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (1475-1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Considered one of the greatest artists of all time, Michelangelo created works of unparalleled beauty and emotional power: the *David* sculpture in Florence, the Sistine Chapel ceiling and *Last Judgment* in Vatican, and the design of St. Peter's Basilica dome. A contemporary of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, Michelangelo was called *Il Divino* ("the Divine One") during his lifetime. His mastery of anatomy, his heroic depiction of the human form, and his ability to extract figures that seemed to live within marble made him the archetype of Renaissance genius.

**Terribilità:**
Quality of awe-inspiring grandeur in his figures. Muscular power, emotional intensity.

## Famous Quotes

> "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."

> "The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark."

> "If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all."

> "Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it."
