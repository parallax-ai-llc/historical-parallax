## Summary

Max von Laue was a German physicist who won the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of X-ray diffraction by crystals. This discovery proved that X-rays are electromagnetic waves and that crystals have periodic atomic structures. His work opened the field of X-ray crystallography, which became essential for determining the structures of molecules including DNA.
