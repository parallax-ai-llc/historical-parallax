## Summary

William Lawrence Bragg was an Australian-born British physicist who shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics with his father William Henry Bragg for their work on the analysis of crystal structure using X-rays. At age 25, he remains the youngest person ever to win a Nobel Prize. He formulated Bragg's law, which relates the angles at which X-rays are diffracted by crystal planes. He later directed the Cavendish Laboratory where the DNA structure was discovered.
