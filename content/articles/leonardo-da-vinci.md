## Summary

Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included painting, sculpture, architecture, science, mathematics, engineering, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, paleontology, and cartography. Often described as the archetype of the "Renaissance man," Leonardo is revered for his masterpieces *Mona Lisa* and *The Last Supper*, which are among the most famous paintings ever created. Beyond art, his notebooks reveal a mind that was centuries ahead—filled with designs for flying machines, tanks, submarines, and anatomical studies of unprecedented detail. Though many of his inventions were never built in his lifetime, Leonardo's combination of artistic genius and scientific curiosity epitomizes human creative potential.
