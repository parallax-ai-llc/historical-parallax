## Summary

Rudolf Clausius was a German physicist and mathematician who formulated the second law of thermodynamics and introduced the concept of entropy. He stated that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter one, establishing one of the most fundamental principles in physics. His work on the kinetic theory of gases and thermodynamics was foundational to modern physics and chemistry.
