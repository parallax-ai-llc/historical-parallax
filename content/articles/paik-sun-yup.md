## Summary

Paik Sun-yup (November 23, 1920 – July 10, 2020) was the first four-star general in South Korean military history and one of the most controversial figures in modern Korean history.[^1] Best known for his distinguished service during the Korean War, where American commanders praised him as "the finest operational commander in the Republic of Korea," Paik led critical battles including the defense of the Pusan Perimeter at Tabu-dong and commanded the first UN forces to enter Pyongyang.[^2] However, his legacy remains deeply contested due to his service in the Japanese-controlled Manchukuo Imperial Army's Gando Special Force, where he participated in operations against Korean independence fighters during World War II.[^3] After his military career, he served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, diplomat to multiple nations, and South Korea's Minister of Transportation, leaving a complex legacy that continues to divide South Korean society between those who celebrate his defense of South Korea and those who condemn his collaboration with Japanese colonial forces.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Paik Sun-yup was born on November 23, 1920, in the small town of Tokhung in Kangso County, seventeen miles southeast of Pyongyang, in what is now North Korea.[^5] He was the second of three siblings, with an older sister and a younger brother, and was raised by a widowed mother under extremely difficult circumstances.[^6] The family's poverty was so severe that it shaped much of Paik's early life and influenced his later decisions.

In 1925, when Paik was five years old, his family moved to Pyongyang, where they lived in deplorable conditions in a single rented room.[^7] The grinding poverty they endured was so extreme that his mother, unable to feed her three children, attempted to commit family suicide by jumping from the Taedong River Bridge with all her children.[^8] She was dissuaded from this desperate act by her eldest daughter, who convinced her to continue struggling to survive. This traumatic early experience left an indelible mark on young Paik and his understanding of survival and sacrifice.

To support the family after moving to Pyongyang, Paik's mother and older sister took jobs at a rubber factory.[^9] The meager wages they earned, combined with greatly reduced tuition assistance, allowed young Paik to attend Mansu Primary School for four years before transferring to Yaksong Primary School.[^10] Despite the family's poverty, education was prioritized as a path to a better life, and Paik proved to be a dedicated student.

After completing primary education, Paik spent five years studying at the prestigious Pyongyang Normal School, a missionary institution where he learned English and trained to become a teacher.[^11] The Normal School provided teacher training and was seen as a respectable path for young Koreans during the Japanese colonial period. His education at this missionary school exposed him to Western ideas and the English language, skills that would later prove invaluable during his interactions with American military commanders during the Korean War.

However, in 1939, at age nineteen, Paik made a decision that would forever alter his life trajectory and later become the source of immense controversy: instead of becoming a teacher as his education had prepared him to do, he volunteered to attend the Mukden Military Academy of Manchukuo in Japanese-occupied Manchuria.[^12] This choice would launch his military career but also mark him in the eyes of many Koreans as a collaborator with Japanese imperialism during one of the darkest periods of Korean history.

## Rise to Power

Paik Sun-yup's rise to prominence began during the Japanese occupation of Korea and Manchuria, a period that would later haunt his legacy. After graduating from the Mukden Military Academy of Manchukuo in 1941, Paik became a second lieutenant in the Manchukuo Imperial Army at the age of twenty-one.[^13] He was assigned to the notorious Gando Special Force, a unit composed primarily of ethnic Koreans that operated in the border regions between northern Korea and Manchukuo.[^14]

The Gando Special Force was tasked with suppressing anti-Japanese and pro-communist militant groups, including Korean independence fighters who were resisting Japanese colonial rule.[^15] From 1943 to 1945, Paik served in this capacity, engaging in guerrilla suppression operations in Jiandao (Gando in Korean) in eastern Manchuria.[^16] According to government records, these operations resulted in approximately 172 deaths, including civilians.[^17] Though Paik later denied direct engagement in fights with Korean independence fighters, his service in this unit would become the central controversy of his legacy, leading to his designation as a chinilpa (pro-Japanese collaborator) decades later.[^18]

As an officer in the Manchukuo Imperial Army, Paik fought Communist guerrillas in eastern Manchuria and later Chinese Red Army forces in North China until the Soviet military invaded Manchuria in August 1945.[^19] When Japan surrendered and World War II ended, Paik briefly worked with the Korean Nationalist Movement in the chaos that followed liberation.[^20] However, he quickly became convinced that the Communists would dominate Russian-controlled North Korea, prompting him to flee south across the 38th parallel in late 1945.[^21]

In South Korea, Paik's military training and experience made him valuable to the fledgling Republic of Korea Army, despite his service under the Japanese. He joined the Constabulary, which would later become the ROK Army, and rapidly rose through the ranks.[^22] By 1948, as tensions between North and South Korea intensified, Paik had already established himself as a capable officer. When the Korean War erupted on June 25, 1950, with the North Korean People's Army invading across the 38th parallel, Colonel Paik Sun-yup commanded the ROK 1st Infantry Division, one of the most critical South Korean units.[^23]

The early days of the war were catastrophic for South Korean forces, with most units collapsing or retreating in disarray before the overwhelming North Korean assault. However, Paik distinguished himself by maintaining unit cohesion and conducting an organized fighting retreat, preventing the complete disintegration of his division.[^24] His competent leadership during this crisis earned him rapid promotion to Brigadier General on July 25, 1950, just one month after the war began.[^25] At age twenty-nine, Paik was one of the youngest generals in the ROK Army and had established himself as one of its most capable commanders.

## Major Achievements

General Paik Sun-yup's military achievements during the Korean War established him as South Korea's most celebrated combat commander and earned him the respect of American military leaders. His most significant accomplishments occurred during the darkest days of the war and in the crucial anti-guerrilla campaigns that followed.

**Defense of the Pusan Perimeter and the Battle of Tabu-dong**

After retreating under relentless North Korean pressure, UN and ROK forces established a defensive perimeter around the southeastern port city of Pusan (now Busan) in August 1950.[^26] The survival of South Korea as a nation depended on holding this perimeter until reinforcements could arrive. Paik's 1st Division was assigned to defend the critical northern approach to Pusan near the town of Tabu-dong, just north of the city of Taegu (now Daegu).[^27]

The Battle of Tabu-dong, fought from September 1 to September 15, 1950, became one of the fiercest and most critical engagements of the Korean War.[^28] Paik teamed up with U.S. Colonel John "Mike" Michaelis, commander of the 27th Infantry Regiment (the "Wolfhounds"), with Paik's ROK troops holding the hills around Tabu-dong while American forces held the road and engaged North Korean tanks.[^29] For Paik's soldiers, the battle consisted mainly of intense, exhausting hand-to-hand combat.[^30] Night after night, North Korean tanks advanced down a 2.5-mile road that American soldiers nicknamed the "Bowling Alley" because of the sound of tank rounds ricocheting off the rocky terrain.[^31]

When his exhausted troops began to retreat, Paik delivered a legendary speech that rallied them: "I want to thank you for fighting like you have. But we just don't have room to retreat any more. The only place left for us to go is into the ocean. If we run now, Korea is done for."[^32] He then made a dramatic promise: "I will be at the forefront of the fight. If I retreat, shoot me first."[^33] This display of leadership steadied his troops and they held their positions. Despite suffering tremendous casualties in desperate fighting, the ROK 1st Division held the line at Tabu-dong, contributing critically to the successful defense of the Pusan Perimeter.[^34] For his gallantry during this battle, Paik was awarded the Distinguished Silver Star by Eighth Army Commanding General Lieutenant General Walton Walker.[^35]

**Capture of Pyongyang**

Following the successful Inchon Landing in September 1950 and the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, UN forces drove north in pursuit of the retreating North Korean army. In one of the war's most symbolic moments, on October 19, 1950, Paik's ROK 1st Division became the first UN element to enter Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea.[^36] For Paik, entering his hometown as a liberator rather than under communist rule was deeply personal. However, this triumph would be short-lived, as Chinese intervention in late November 1950 would force UN troops into a massive retreat southward.

Reflecting on the Chinese intervention and the subsequent retreat, Paik later wrote in his memoirs: "For us in the ROK Army, December 3, 1950, lives as the day when our dream of national unification by force was dashed forever."[^37] This retreat was devastating for South Korean forces who had briefly hoped to reunify the peninsula under their government.

**Operation Rat Killer**

By early 1951, communist guerrilla fighters had established significant presence in the mountainous regions of southern South Korea, threatening supply lines and terrorizing civilian populations.[^38] In November 1951, Paik was given command of Operation Rat Killer, the largest anti-guerrilla operation of the Korean War, designed to eliminate these communist forces from south-central Korea.[^39] He was given operational control of two divisions pulled from the front lines specifically for this mission.[^40]

The three-phase operation centered on the Jiri Mountain region in southwestern Korea and began on December 2, 1951, when Task Force Paik began systematically shrinking a 163-mile perimeter around the mountain.[^41] After just twelve days of operations, 1,612 guerrillas had been killed and 1,842 captured.[^42] The campaign continued with relentless pressure, employing combined arms tactics and cutting off guerrilla supply lines and escape routes. By the time Operation Rat Killer concluded in mid-March 1952, Task Force Paik had killed or captured approximately 19,000 guerrillas and bandits.[^43] While the operation did not completely eliminate all guerrilla resistance, it dealt communist irregular forces a crushing blow from which they never recovered. For this success, Paik was promoted to Lieutenant General.[^44]

**Senior Command and Diplomatic Recognition**

Paik rose to corps command in April 1951 and was placed in charge of the entire eastern sector of Korea.[^45] In July 1951, he represented the South Korean military at the failed Kaesong Truce Talks, gaining diplomatic experience that would later serve him well.[^46] In July 1952, he was appointed Army Chief of Staff, the highest position in the ROK Army.[^47] Finally, in January 1953, Paik Sun-yup became the first full general (four-star general) in South Korean military history, a position he achieved at the remarkably young age of thirty-two.[^48]

American commanders universally praised Paik's abilities. General Matthew B. Ridgway and General James A. Van Fleet, who commanded the Eighth Army, stated that Paik "was, without question, the finest operational commander in the Republic of Korea."[^49] During the war, Paik participated in all ten major campaigns and earned a reputation for not making significant tactical mistakes, maintaining unit discipline, and fostering smooth relationships with U.S. military officers at a time when many other ROK commanders struggled with these challenges.[^50]

For his service, Paik became South Korea's most highly decorated war veteran, receiving the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit with Gold Star (four times), four U.S. Legion of Merit medals, the U.S. Silver Star for gallantry, and numerous other Korean and international decorations.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his celebrated military achievements during the Korean War, Paik Sun-yup's legacy has been profoundly complicated by his service under Japanese colonial rule and ongoing debates about collaboration, nationalism, and historical memory in South Korea.

**Service in the Gando Special Force**

The most serious criticism of Paik centers on his service in the Manchukuo Imperial Army's Gando Special Force from 1943 to 1945.[^52] This unit, composed primarily of ethnic Koreans, was specifically tasked with hunting down and suppressing Korean independence fighters and communist guerrillas who were resisting Japanese colonial rule in Manchuria.[^53] During this period, when many Koreans were fighting and dying for independence from Japan, Paik wore the uniform of the Japanese-controlled Manchukuo army and participated in operations against fellow Koreans.[^54]

According to official records, the Gando Special Force's operations resulted in approximately 172 deaths, including civilians, during the suppression campaigns.[^55] While Paik later denied direct engagement in combat with Korean independence fighters, his presence in the unit and participation in its mission made him, in the eyes of many historians and activists, complicit in Japanese colonial oppression.[^56] Critics argue that regardless of the economic pressures or limited opportunities available to young Koreans at the time, the choice to join the Manchukuo military and actively fight against Korean independence represented an unforgivable betrayal.

**Chinilpa Designation**

The controversy over Paik's wartime service came to a head in the 2000s when South Korea's progressive governments began formally investigating and documenting collaboration with Japanese colonial authorities. In 2008, the Institute for National Affairs published the "Pro-Japanese Personalities and People's Exhibition," which included Paik in the military section of prospective chinilpa (pro-Japanese collaborator) candidates.[^57] 

More significantly, in 2009, the Roh Moo-hyun administration's National Behavior Commission included Paik Sun-yup on a highly controversial list of 705 individuals designated as chinilpas.[^58] This official designation as a collaborator was a devastating blow to Paik's reputation and sparked intense political debate in South Korea. For many progressives and descendants of independence fighters, the designation was long overdue recognition of historical truth. For conservatives and Korean War veterans, it was a politically motivated attack on a national hero who had defended South Korea from communist invasion.

**Burial Controversy**

When Paik died on July 10, 2020, at age ninety-nine, the controversy over his legacy erupted into a public battle over where and how he should be buried.[^59] Conservative groups and Korean War veterans argued that South Korea's first four-star general deserved burial at the prestigious Seoul National Cemetery with full military honors. However, progressive activists and groups honoring independence fighters vehemently opposed this, questioning whether it was appropriate to bury "a pro-Japanese collaborator who suppressed independence fighters at a national cemetery."[^60]

The Moon Jae-in government, caught between competing historical narratives, offered only a modest fifth-level state funeral rather than the higher-level ceremony typically afforded to figures of Paik's military rank.[^61] There were no official statements from the Blue House (presidential office) or the ruling Democratic Party regarding his death.[^62] The Justice Party explicitly expressed opposition to his burial at a national cemetery, with members stating they would "feel ashamed to see independence fighters" if someone who had been "a puppet of Japanese imperialism" was interred there.[^63]

Ultimately, Paik was buried at the National Cemetery in Daejeon in central South Korea, not the more prestigious Seoul National Cemetery.[^64] Some Democratic Party members even submitted legislation to authorize the removal of graves from national cemeteries if the interred individuals were later proven to be pro-Japanese collaborators.[^65]

**The Fundamental Dilemma**

The controversy surrounding Paik Sun-yup reflects deeper questions about historical memory, national identity, and how societies should evaluate complex figures who both collaborated with oppressors and later defended their nation. As scholar Scott Snyder noted, the ongoing debate over Paik "may be the most consequential contemporary manifestation of his legacy and contributions," adding that without Paik's sacrifices during the Korean War, "the freedom to debate Paik's role itself would possibly not exist."[^66] This paradox—that Paik's defense of South Korea enabled the very democracy that now condemns his earlier collaboration—lies at the heart of the enduring controversy over his legacy.

## Personal Life

Paik Sun-yup's personal life was marked by family hardship, wartime separation, and decades of public service that left limited documentation of his private affairs. Unlike his extensively documented military career, details about his family relationships and personal characteristics remain relatively sparse in historical records.

During the chaotic early months of the Korean War, while commanding the ROK 1st Division at the front lines, Paik was briefly reunited with his family in Pusan in 1950.[^67] He found his mother, wife, and three-year-old daughter living together in a single small room without money or adequate food—conditions painfully reminiscent of his own childhood poverty in Pyongyang.[^68] Most distressing, his wife was critically ill with typhoid fever, one of many diseases that ravaged refugee populations during the war.[^69] The reunion was brief, as Paik had to return to his combat command, leaving his family in these desperate circumstances while he fought to defend the Pusan Perimeter.

Historical sources confirm that Paik was married and had at least one daughter, who was three years old during the early 1950s.[^70] At the turn of the twenty-first century, he lived with his wife in Seoul.[^71] However, detailed information about his wife's name, background, the total number of children they had, or other aspects of their family life has not been extensively documented in available sources. This absence of personal detail is not uncommon for military figures of his generation, where public service overshadowed private life in historical records.

Those who knew Paik professionally described him as a decisive, charismatic leader who inspired loyalty among his troops. His dramatic speeches during critical battles, such as his famous declaration at Tabu-dong that his soldiers should shoot him if he retreated, demonstrated his understanding of leadership and personal courage.[^72] His ability to work effectively with American commanders while maintaining the respect and authority over Korean troops required considerable diplomatic skill and cultural adaptability—traits likely developed during his missionary school education where he learned English.[^73]

After retiring from active military service, Paik remained engaged in veterans' affairs and historical memory projects related to the Korean War. He authored his memoir, "From Pusan to Panmunjom: Wartime Memoirs of the Republic of Korea's First Four-Star General," which provided his personal account of the war and his role in it.[^74] The memoir offered insight into his decision-making during critical battles and his perspective on the war's impact on Korea, though it did not extensively address the controversies surrounding his service under Japanese colonial rule.

In his later years, despite the growing controversy over his Manchukuo service, Paik remained a revered figure among South Korean conservatives and Korean War veterans. In June 2013, at age ninety-two, he visited the Eighth Army operational command post that had been named in his honor, where he was given the title of honorary commander—a recognition of his continued symbolic importance to the U.S.-ROK military alliance.[^75]

## Legacy

The legacy of Paik Sun-yup embodies one of the most profound and divisive debates in modern Korean history: how should a nation remember those who both collaborated with colonial oppressors and later defended the nation's survival? This question has made Paik's legacy deeply contested, with his contributions evaluated dramatically differently depending on political ideology, generational perspective, and historical priorities.

**The Korean War Hero Narrative**

For South Korean conservatives, Korean War veterans, and U.S. military officials, Paik Sun-yup represents an indispensable figure in the defense of South Korean freedom and democracy. Without his leadership at critical moments—particularly the defense of Tabu-dong and Operation Rat Killer—South Korea might not have survived as an independent nation.[^76] American commanders' assessment of him as "the finest operational commander in the Republic of Korea" carries significant weight, as the Korean War was fundamentally a coalition effort where Korean-American cooperation determined success or failure.[^77]

The United States has consistently honored Paik's memory. When he died in 2020, the U.S. National Security Council tweeted that South Korea is "a prosperous, democratic Republic thanks to Paik Sun-yup and other heroes who defeated Communist invaders in the 1950s."[^78] The State Department noted that his service in the Korean War was "emblematic of the fight for the values of freedom and democracy."[^79] General Vincent Brooks, former commander of U.S. Forces Korea, described Paik's death as "a deep loss for the alliance and a true part of history."[^80] For the approximately 25,000 South Koreans who visited memorial altars at Gwanghwamun to pay respects after his death, Paik remained a revered national hero whose wartime service outweighed all other considerations.[^81]

**The Collaborator Narrative**

For South Korean progressives, independence movement descendants, and younger generations educated about colonial history, Paik represents the problematic rehabilitation of colonial collaborators in post-war South Korea. They argue that his service in the Gando Special Force, hunting Korean independence fighters while Korea suffered under brutal Japanese occupation, represents an unforgivable betrayal that no subsequent service can erase.[^82] From this perspective, Paik's military success during the Korean War does not absolve his participation in Japanese colonial oppression—it merely demonstrates how collaborators were able to transition their careers to serve new masters while genuine independence fighters were often marginalized in post-liberation Korea.[^83]

The 2009 official designation of Paik as a chinilpa (pro-Japanese collaborator) represented a formal governmental acknowledgment of this historical reality, though it came decades after his most significant contributions and well into his old age.[^84] For advocates of this designation, it was an essential act of historical justice that acknowledged the suffering of independence fighters and refused to allow nationalist narratives about the Korean War to completely overshadow the colonial period's moral complexities.

**Institutional Recognition and Removal**

The contested nature of Paik's legacy has led to ongoing debates about institutional honors. While he was buried at Daejeon National Cemetery, the lower-level ceremony and location (compared to Seoul National Cemetery) reflected the government's attempt to navigate between competing constituencies.[^85] In a dramatic demonstration of this controversy's ongoing nature, South Korea removed state burial records of General Paik as a pro-Japanese figure in recent years, though the exact circumstances and implications of this removal remain subjects of political debate.[^86]

**The Paradox of Democratic Memory**

Perhaps the most insightful observation about Paik's legacy comes from Scott Snyder, who noted that the ongoing debate over Paik's service and legacy is itself only possible because of Paik's military contributions during the Korean War.[^87] The democratic South Korea that can freely debate whether to honor or condemn Paik exists partly because he helped defend it from conquest. This creates a profound paradox: the freedom to condemn Paik's collaboration exists because of his defense of that freedom. From this perspective, both the celebration and condemnation of Paik are legitimate expressions of the democratic values he helped preserve.

**Comparative Historical Assessment**

Korean historian Park Myung-lim has argued that the Korean War was the only major Cold War conflict in which the United States succeeded in defending a free society in Asia, and that this success was made possible by commanders like Paik.[^88] This assessment emphasizes Paik's role in a global historical context, where his tactical competence contributed to one of the few instances where a democratic nation successfully resisted communist expansion during the Cold War period.

**An Unresolved Legacy**

Paik Sun-yup died in 2020 without reconciliation of these competing narratives about his life. His legacy remains a battlefield where South Koreans contest fundamental questions about their national identity, the weight of colonial history, the meaning of patriotism, and who deserves to be remembered as a hero. Unlike historical figures who fade into consensus, Paik's legacy has become more controversial with time, as South Korean democracy has created space for previously marginalized historical narratives to challenge dominant Cold War-era accounts that minimized collaboration and emphasized anti-communism.

The fact that South Korea continues to struggle with how to remember Paik—whether his burial should be honored or his records removed, whether streets and buildings should bear his name or be renamed—demonstrates that his legacy is not historical memory but living history, continually reinterpreted by each generation according to its own values and priorities.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Paik Sun-yup's defenders, particularly military historians, Korean War veterans, and American military officials, emphasize his extraordinary military competence and his indispensable role in South Korea's survival during its darkest hour. American generals Matthew B. Ridgway and James A. Van Fleet's assessment that Paik was "without question, the finest operational commander in the Republic of Korea" is frequently cited as authoritative evidence of his military excellence.[^89] These commanders worked directly with Paik and observed his leadership under the most challenging combat conditions, lending significant credibility to their evaluation.

Military scholars have particularly praised Paik's ability to maintain unit cohesion and discipline during the chaotic early months of the Korean War, when most ROK Army units disintegrated or fled in panic.[^90] His conduct of fighting retreats that preserved his division's combat effectiveness, followed by his successful defense of critical positions like Tabu-dong, demonstrated tactical sophistication and leadership that was rare among ROK commanders at the time. One military analysis noted that Paik "did not make major mistakes, preventing the routing and disintegration of formations that plagued other commanders."[^91]

The successful execution of Operation Rat Killer further demonstrated Paik's capabilities beyond conventional battlefield command. Anti-guerrilla warfare requires different skills than conventional combat, including intelligence gathering, population control, and sustained operations in difficult terrain. The operation's success in killing or capturing 19,000 guerrillas over several months showed Paik's adaptability and comprehensive military competence.[^92]

Defenders also emphasize Paik's role in establishing the credibility of ROK forces with American allies. At a time when U.S. commanders had little confidence in Korean military capabilities following early defeats, Paik's ROK 1st Division demonstrated that Korean units could fight effectively when properly led.[^93] This credibility was essential for South Korea's continued receipt of American military support and ultimately its survival as an independent nation.

Regarding the collaboration controversy, some defenders argue that context matters in evaluating Paik's choices as a young man during the colonial period. They point out that opportunities for educated Koreans were severely limited under Japanese rule, and that many Koreans who later became important figures in South Korean society had some form of association with Japanese institutions out of economic necessity rather than ideological commitment.[^94] From this perspective, Paik's subsequent lifetime of service to South Korea, including his defense of the nation during the Korean War and his diplomatic service, demonstrates where his true loyalties lay.

American assessments have remained consistently positive. The U.S. State Department's 2020 statement that Paik's service was "emblematic of the fight for the values of freedom and democracy" reflects continued American appreciation for his role in defending South Korea and strengthening the U.S.-ROK alliance.[^95] For American military professionals, Paik represents the best qualities of an allied commander: competence, courage, and reliability under pressure.

### Negative Views

Critics of Paik Sun-yup, particularly progressive historians, independence movement advocates, and younger South Koreans educated about colonial history, argue that his service in the Gando Special Force represents a moral failure that cannot be mitigated by subsequent achievements. From this perspective, during the most critical period of Korean history—when the nation was fighting for its very independence—Paik chose to wear the uniform of the oppressor and actively participated in suppressing Korean independence fighters.[^96]

The designation of Paik as a chinilpa (pro-Japanese collaborator) by the National Behavior Commission in 2009 represented the formal scholarly and governmental conclusion that his service in the Manchukuo Imperial Army constituted genuine collaboration rather than mere survival or neutral participation.[^97] The Gando Special Force was not a general military unit but a specialized force explicitly created to hunt down Korean guerrillas fighting for independence.[^98] Critics argue that this specific mission makes Paik's service qualitatively different from Koreans who may have worked in Japanese factories or served in non-combat roles out of economic necessity.

The Institute for National Affairs' inclusion of Paik in the "Pro-Japanese Personalities and People's Exhibition" reflected growing scholarly consensus among revisionist historians that South Korea's post-liberation governments had systematically overlooked or minimized collaboration by individuals who later became useful during the anti-communist struggle.[^99] From this analytical framework, Paik's celebrated military career during the Korean War actually demonstrates the problem: collaborators were able to seamlessly transition into positions of power and authority in post-liberation South Korea, while many genuine independence fighters were marginalized or even persecuted during the anti-communist campaigns of the 1950s.

Progressive critics also question the narrative that emphasizes Paik's role in defending "freedom and democracy." They note that the South Korean government he defended during the Korean War was the authoritarian Syngman Rhee regime, which imprisoned political opponents, suppressed dissent, and perpetrated massacres of suspected leftist civilians.[^100] From this perspective, celebrating Paik as a defender of democracy involves considerable historical revisionism about what South Korea actually was in the 1950s.

The Justice Party's statement opposing Paik's burial at a national cemetery—that they would "feel ashamed to see independence fighters" if a "puppet of Japanese imperialism" was buried there—reflects the moral clarity of critics who refuse to allow anti-communist credentials to override collaboration with colonialism.[^101] This position holds that historical memory should prioritize those who fought for Korean independence over those who fought against them, regardless of subsequent service.

Some critics have also questioned whether Paik's military competence during the Korean War has been overstated due to American favoritism and his English language skills, which allowed him to communicate more effectively with American commanders than other ROK officers.[^102] They suggest that his elevation to senior command positions may have owed as much to his ability to work within the American-dominated command structure as to his tactical abilities, and that other Korean commanders who lacked his colonial military training and language skills were unfairly overlooked.

Finally, critics argue that the continued celebration of Paik by conservative politicians and the U.S. military represents an unwillingness to seriously reckon with South Korea's colonial history and the compromised nature of its post-liberation political order. The fact that South Korea's most decorated military hero served in the Japanese colonial military is not a paradox to be explained away but a fundamental contradiction that reveals uncomfortable truths about who was empowered in post-liberation Korea and whose service was valued.[^103]
