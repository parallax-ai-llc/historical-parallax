## Summary

Nguyễn Văn Tường (1824–1886) was a powerful mandarin and regent of the Nguyễn dynasty during one of Vietnam's most turbulent periods—the final collapse of independence before French colonial rule.[^1] Born to a peasant family in Quảng Trị, he rose through the Confucian examination system to become Minister of Domestic and Foreign Affairs and eventually co-regent alongside Tôn Thất Thuyết.[^2] Known for both negotiating treaties with France and leading armed resistance against French colonization, Tường's legacy remains deeply controversial—viewed by some as a patriotic defender of Vietnamese sovereignty and by others as a ruthless power broker whose machinations weakened the dynasty at its most critical hour.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Nguyễn Văn Tường was born in 1824 in An Cư village (in present-day Triệu Phước commune, Triệu Phong district, Quảng Trị province) in central Vietnam, to a peasant family.[^4] His humble origins were not uncommon among Vietnamese mandarins of the 19th century, as the Confucian examination system theoretically allowed men of any background to rise to positions of power through demonstrated mastery of classical Chinese literature, philosophy, and law.[^5]

During the Nguyễn dynasty, the examination system was divided into three tiers: thi Hương (provincial examination), thi Hội (metropolitan examination), and thi Đình (court examination).[^6] Success in these examinations brought bureaucratic appointment as a mandarin, high prestige in society, and land grants from the government.[^7] It took several years to gain proficiency in Chinese script and to master the Confucian scholarship needed to pass these triennial examinations.[^8]

Historical records indicate that during the Thừa Thiên examination, a candidate named Nguyễn Phúc Tường had his licentiate registration stripped and his name changed to Nguyễn Văn Tường because Emperor Thiệu Trị detested his illegal usage of the dynastic surname "Phúc."[^9] The emperor ordered his name be removed from the list of graduates, changed it to Nguyễn Văn Tường, and handed him over to the Censorate for punishment, resulting in one year in exile.[^10] Whether this refers to the same Nguyễn Văn Tường who would later become regent remains a matter of scholarly debate, though the timing and geographical origin suggest they may be the same person.

Despite this early setback, Tường eventually succeeded in the examination system and entered imperial service during the reign of Emperor Tự Đức (1847-1883), becoming one of the most influential mandarins of the late Nguyễn dynasty.[^11] His education in Confucian classics shaped his worldview, and even in the 1890s, he still referred to Chinese texts like Xu Jishe's "A Brief Survey of the Maritime Circuit" when seeking to understand Western powers, reflecting the broader Vietnamese scholarly approach of looking to Chinese sources for information about the West.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Nguyễn Văn Tường's political ascent began in earnest during the turbulent 1870s, when France intensified its military pressure on Vietnam. In 1873, following the Garnier Expedition crisis, Emperor Tự Đức gave Tường the critical responsibility of negotiating with the French.[^13] This appointment marked him as one of the emperor's most trusted advisors during an existential threat to Vietnamese sovereignty.

On January 5, 1874, French diplomat Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre and Nguyễn Văn Tường signed a preliminary convention that would serve as the draft for the official treaty signed later in Saigon.[^14] The Treaty of Saigon, concluded on March 15, 1874, is often referred to as the "Philastre Treaty."[^15] Following successful negotiations and the recovery of Hanoi after the attack by Francis Garnier, Tường was promoted to the prestigious post of Minister of Domestic and Foreign Affairs—one of the highest positions in the imperial bureaucracy.[^16]

In 1881, Tường's influence reached its apex when he became head of the Cabinet of Ministers, effectively making him the most powerful civil official in the empire.[^17] His position gave him enormous influence over both domestic policy and Vietnam's increasingly desperate diplomatic efforts to maintain independence in the face of French expansion.

When Emperor Tự Đức died on July 17, 1883, the succession crisis that followed would prove to be the defining moment of Tường's career.[^18] Tự Đức, left impotent by smallpox, had no biological children despite maintaining a large harem.[^19] He had adopted nephews as symbolic heirs but left the throne's transition unresolved amid court intrigue. Tường was appointed as one of three regents, alongside Tôn Thất Thuyết and Trần Tiễn Thành, though contemporary accounts make clear that Thuyết and Tường dominated the court and wielded far more power than Trần Tiễn Thành.[^20]

## Major Achievements

### Diplomatic Negotiations with France

Nguyễn Văn Tường's most significant diplomatic achievement came in 1873-1874 when he successfully negotiated the Philastre Treaty with France.[^21] The treaty temporarily halted French military expansion and secured the return of Hanoi to Vietnamese control, earning Tường his promotion to Minister of Domestic and Foreign Affairs.[^22] For a brief period, the treaty appeared to have stabilized Franco-Vietnamese relations, though it would ultimately prove to be merely a temporary respite before further French encroachment.

### Administrative Reforms

As head of the Cabinet of Ministers from 1881, Tường wielded considerable influence over the administration of the Nguyễn dynasty during its final years.[^23] The royal court during this period expressed awareness of the "stagnant and backward situation of feudal education" modeled after Chinese Confucian education, and urged mandarins to reform the school and examination systems.[^24] While specific reforms attributed directly to Tường are not well-documented, his position placed him at the center of these reform efforts.

### Leadership of the Cần Vương Movement

Following the French assault on Huế in July 1885, Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết orchestrated a nationwide insurrection against French colonial rule.[^25] On July 4, 1885, acting in the name of the young Emperor Hàm Nghi, they launched coordinated attacks across Vietnam.[^26] On July 13, 1885, after the fall of the capital, Emperor Hàm Nghi issued the Royal Edict of Cần Vương ("Save the King"), calling on scholars, officials, and the people to rise up and save the country.[^27]

The Cần Vương movement became a large-scale Vietnamese insurgency between 1885 and 1896, with the objective of expelling the French and installing Hàm Nghi as the leader of a restored independent Vietnam.[^28] The royal decree became "a sacred call, forging the will and aspiration for independence of the entire nation," gathering prominent resistance figures such as Tống Duy Tân, Đinh Công Tráng, Lê Trực, and Phan Đình Phùng.[^29] Though the movement ultimately failed militarily, it left "an immortal spiritual legacy of the will to protect national sovereignty."[^30]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Murder of Emperors

Nguyễn Văn Tường's most controversial actions involved his role in the deposition and execution of multiple emperors during the succession crisis of 1883-1884.[^31] After Emperor Tự Đức's death, one of his nephews, Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Ái, was crowned as Emperor Dục Đức but was imprisoned and executed after only three days by the three regents—Nguyễn Văn Tường, Tôn Thất Thuyết, and Trần Tiễn Thành.[^32] Historical sources state that Dục Đức "died in 1883 in jail due to no food."[^33] The exact reasons for this brutal treatment remain unclear, though some historians speculate it was "a vengeance killing due to the monarch's interference in the affair between Tường and Học Phi."[^34]

The regents then installed Tự Đức's brother, Nguyễn Phúc Hồng Dật, as Emperor Hiệp Hòa on July 30, 1883.[^35] However, "the new emperor was aware of their faults, so he decided to steer clear of them, and as a result, they wanted to dispose of him."[^36] When Hiệp Hòa attempted to make a deal with the French for protection, the regents acted swiftly. In November 1883, when French forces were absent, Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết executed both Emperor Hiệp Hòa and Trần Tiễn Thành for their perceived pro-French sympathies.[^37] The next day, Father Thọ carried to the French resident "an apocryphal letter of abdication by Hiep-Hoa, saying that the sovereign had committed suicide," though the French resident rejected this claim.[^38]

Senior Censorate official Phan Đình Phùng denounced the three regents for their irregular handling of Tự Đức's succession, but Tôn Thất Thuyết excoriated Phan Đình Phùng and sent him from the court.[^39]

### The Affair with Học Phi

Tường was having an affair with Học Phi (Nguyễn Thị Hương), one of the imperial consorts who formed part of the "Tam Cung" (Three Palaces) triumvirate alongside Dowager Empress Từ Dụ and consort Trang Ý.[^40] Học Phi was a wife of Emperor Tự Đức and adoptive mother of Emperor Kiến Phúc.[^41] 

When Emperor Kiến Phúc caught Tường with Học Phi and vowed to kill them for their conduct, Học Phi took drastic action: she poisoned Kiến Phúc's medicine, and he died the next day.[^42] There are hypotheses that Tôn Thất Thuyết and Nguyễn Văn Tường killed King Kiến Phúc (or facilitated his death through Học Phi) to enthrone a younger king to make it easier to take full power.[^43] After Kiến Phúc's death in 1884, the regents installed the 13-year-old Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Lịch as Emperor Hàm Nghi.[^44]

### The Patenôtre Treaty and Surrender of Sovereignty

Despite his later role in armed resistance, Nguyễn Văn Tường signed one of the most consequential treaties in Vietnamese history. After achieving peace with China through the Tientsin Accord in May 1884, on June 6, 1884, French Ambassador Jules Patenôtre des Noyers signed the Protectorate Treaty of Patenôtre with Nguyễn Văn Tường, which confirmed French dominion over Vietnam.[^45] The treaty created the protectorates of Annam (central Vietnam) and Tonkin (northern Vietnam), forming the basis of French colonial rule in Vietnam for the next seven decades.[^46]

The treaty represented "a mortal blow to the influence" of Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết, as it solidified French control that the regents would spend the next year trying to overthrow.[^47] Critics argue that Tường's willingness to sign such a treaty demonstrated either political naivety, personal cowardice, or cynical calculation that he could later reverse its terms through military action.

---

## Personal Life

Nguyễn Văn Tường's personal life was marked by scandal and political intrigue. His illicit affair with Học Phi, the imperial consort of Emperor Tự Đức, became one of the most notorious palace scandals of the late Nguyễn dynasty.[^48] Học Phi was not merely a consort but a powerful political figure in her own right, part of the "Tam Cung" triumvirate that "dabbled in palace intrigue" alongside Dowager Empress Từ Dụ and consort Trang Ý.[^49]

The affair had deadly political consequences, culminating in the poisoning of Emperor Kiến Phúc after he discovered the relationship and vowed to execute both Tường and Học Phi.[^50] This scandal reveals Tường as a man willing to risk everything—his position, his life, and the stability of the empire—for personal passion, or perhaps as a ruthless political operator who used intimate relationships to consolidate power within the palace.

French sources characterized the relationship between the two co-regents as "frères ennemis" (enemy brothers)—"le roturier souple et habile" (the flexible and skillful commoner, referring to Tường) and "le militaire aristocrate, brutal et fidèle" (the aristocratic military man, brutal and loyal, referring to Tôn Thất Thuyết).[^51] This characterization suggests Tường was seen as a cunning political operator from common origins, while Thuyết was viewed as a more straightforward military figure of noble birth.

Little is known about Tường's family life, whether he had a wife or children, or what personal motivations drove his political actions beyond the affair with Học Phi. His peasant origins in Quảng Trị suggest he may have maintained family connections to the region, but historical sources focus almost exclusively on his political career and court intrigues.

## Legacy

Nguyễn Văn Tường died in February 1886 in Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, where he had been deported by the French on November 23, 1885.[^52] He was initially deported on September 6, 1885, to Poulo Condore (Côn Đảo), along with the father of Tôn Thất Thuyết, before being sent further into exile in the Pacific.[^53] The French gave Tường two months to bring Emperor Hàm Nghi to heel, and when the young emperor continued to resist, they deported the regent.[^54]

His death in distant exile, far from his homeland, mirrors the fate of the dynasty he served. Within decades, the Confucian examination system he had mastered would be suspended by the French in 1913, with the last local exams occurring from 1915 to 1919, making Vietnam the last country to hold Confucian civil service examinations.[^55]

The Cần Vương movement that Tường helped initiate continued for a decade after his death, with Emperor Hàm Nghi captured in 1888 and resistance continuing until 1896.[^56] Prominent resistance figures like Phan Đình Phùng—who had once denounced Tường for his irregular handling of succession—would become symbols of Vietnamese patriotism and resistance to colonial rule.[^57]

Tường's signing of the Patenôtre Treaty in 1884 established the legal framework for French colonial domination that would last until the mid-20th century, through World War II and the First Indochina War, until Vietnam finally achieved independence in 1954.[^58] His role in both facilitating and resisting French colonization makes him one of the most complex and contradictory figures in Vietnamese history.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some Vietnamese historians and nationalists view Nguyễn Văn Tường as a patriotic figure who attempted to defend Vietnamese sovereignty against overwhelming French military superiority.[^59] His leadership of the July 1885 insurrection and role in the Cần Vương movement demonstrate his ultimate willingness to resist colonial rule through armed struggle.[^60] The royal edict calling people to "rise up and save the country" and "transform chaos into order, turn danger into safety, reclaim land, and restore the borders" reflects nationalist aspirations that would continue throughout Vietnam's anti-colonial struggles.[^61]

Defenders of Tường argue that his 1873 negotiations with France, which resulted in the recovery of Hanoi, demonstrated diplomatic skill during a period of extreme pressure.[^62] The Philastre Treaty temporarily halted French expansion and gave Vietnam breathing room to strengthen its defenses. From this perspective, his later signing of the Patenôtre Treaty in 1884 was a pragmatic response to military reality, and his subsequent armed resistance demonstrated that he had not truly surrendered Vietnamese independence.

The Cần Vương movement that Tường helped launch is celebrated in Vietnamese historical memory as an early expression of national resistance that inspired later generations of anti-colonial fighters.[^63] The movement gathered prominent scholars and officials, demonstrating that the traditional Confucian elite could mobilize for nationalist causes rather than simply accommodate foreign rule.[^64]

### Negative Views

Critics of Nguyễn Văn Tường characterize him as a ruthless power broker whose personal ambition and palace intrigues fatally weakened the Nguyễn dynasty at its moment of greatest peril.[^65] The execution of two emperors—Dục Đức and Hiệp Hòa—within months of each other created political chaos that "temporarily paralyzed the court" precisely when France was launching its final conquest of northern Vietnam.[^66] The French Parliament "quickly voted for the conquest of Vietnam, tens of thousands of reinforcements poured into the Red River Delta," taking advantage of the succession crisis.[^67]

His affair with Học Phi and the resulting poisoning of Emperor Kiến Phúc demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice the empire's stability for personal desires.[^68] Contemporary official Phan Đình Phùng's denunciation of the regents for their "irregular handling" of succession reflects the view that Tường and Thuyết were acting outside traditional Confucian norms and undermining legitimate imperial authority.[^69]

The Patenôtre Treaty of 1884, which Tường signed, is viewed by critics as the legal instrument of Vietnamese subjugation, creating the French protectorates of Annam and Tonkin and establishing seven decades of colonial rule.[^70] That Tường signed this treaty only one year before launching armed resistance raises questions about his strategic judgment and whether his initial collaboration with France made subsequent resistance more difficult and costly.

Some scholars argue that the rapid succession of emperors and palace coups created an impression of Vietnamese political instability that the French exploited to justify their "civilizing mission" and protectorate control.[^71] From this perspective, Tường's machinations provided France with both the opportunity and the justification for conquest.

Finally, critics note that while Tường died in comfortable exile in Tahiti, thousands of Vietnamese fighters and civilians died in the ultimately unsuccessful Cần Vương resistance.[^72] His leadership helped inspire the movement, but he did not remain in Vietnam to face its consequences or share the fate of those who continued the struggle after his deportation.
