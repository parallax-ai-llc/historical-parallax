## Summary
Gilles de Montmorency-Laval, Baron de Rais, was a French nobleman who fought alongside Joan of Arc. He was convicted and executed in 1440 for the murder of possibly over 100 children. Some historians question whether his confession was coerced to seize his estates.

## Early Life
Born September 10, 1404, into one of France's most distinguished families. He inherited vast wealth and became a military hero alongside Joan of Arc at Orléans in 1429. King Charles VII made him Marshal of France. [^1]

## Criminal Career
After Joan of Arc's execution in 1431, de Rais descended into profligacy and alleged occultism. He is believed to have kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered children — predominantly boys from peasant families. Estimates range from 80 to 200+ victims. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Arrested September 15, 1440, tried by ecclesiastical and secular courts in Nantes. Under threat of torture, he confessed. He expressed remorse, received last rites, and was hanged and burned on October 26, 1440. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Decorated military hero who helped liberate France [^4]
- Fought alongside Joan of Arc
- Some historians argue conviction was politically motivated
- Significant patron of arts and education

## Negative Perspectives
- Convicted of murdering numerous children [^5]
- Committed rape, torture, and ritualistic killing
- Exploited noble position to prey on peasant children
- Crimes went unchecked due to wealth and status
