## Summary

The 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg is one of the most famous pre-modern accounts often interpreted as a UFO sighting/battle. At dawn on April 14, 1561, the citizens of Nuremberg (then a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire) witnessed a terrifying "aerial battle" in the sky above the rising sun.

According to a broadsheet by local artist/printer **Hans Glaser**, the sky was filled with hundreds of blood-red crosses, spheres, and tubes that fought each other for over an hour. The event concluded with the objects falling to the earth in a column of smoke and a massive black spear-like object appearing. While skeptics suggest meteorological explanations (like sun dogs), the event remains a cornerstone of "Ancient Aliens" theories.[^1]

## The Event

### The Description (April 14, 1561)
At sunrise (between 4 and 5 AM), the sky apparently filled with strange shapes.
*   **The Objects:** Glaser described "blood-red," bluish, and black ferrous balls (spheres). There were also "blood-red crosses" and vast cylindrical tubes ("cannon barrels") containing smaller balls.
*   **The Battle:** These objects moved erratically, "fighting" one another. Spheres flew from the tubes and attacked the crosses.
*   **The Crash:** After about an hour, the combatants became fatigued and fell from the sky "as if everything were burning," creating immense smoke on the ground.
*   **The Spear:** Finally, a gigantic black spear-shaft appeared, pointing east-west.[^2]

### The Broadsheet
The primary source is a hand-colored woodcut broadsheet created by Hans Glaser. It includes a graphic illustration of the battle and a German text warning that this was a sign from God meant to urge sinners to repent. The document is famously preserved at the **Zentralbibliothek Zürich**.[^3]

## Interpretations

### Religious Omen
In the 16th century, the Reformation was in full swing, and anxiety about the End Times was high. Celestial phenomena (comets, aurorae, sun dogs) were routinely interpreted as divine warnings. Glaser’s text explicitly frames the event as a call to repentance, suggesting the description may be heavily allegorical.[^4]

### Meteorological Phenomenon
Modern skeptics argue the event was likely a complex display of **halo phenomena** (sun dogs/parhelia).
*   **Explanation:** Ice crystals in the atmosphere can create bright spots (mock suns) and arcs. "Tubes" could be pillar effects; "crosses" could be the intersection of halos. The "erratic movement" and "battle" could be atmospheric turbulence distortion or projection of the witnesses' fear.[^5]

### Extraterrestrial Battle
Ufologists see the woodcut as a literal depiction of a dogfight between alien factions.
*   **Visuals:** The "tubes" look like motherships releasing scout craft (spheres). The "black spear" resembles a massive cruiser. This interpretation assumes the witnesses described technology they had no vocabulary for (using "tubes" and "spheres" to describe craft).[^6]

## Similar Events

*   **1566 Celestial Phenomenon over Basel:** just five years later, a similar event occurred in Basel, Switzerland, where black spheres were seen fighting in front of the sun. This was also documented in a woodcut broadsheet.[^7]
