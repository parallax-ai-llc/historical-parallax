## Summary

Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy (March 22, 1869 – February 6, 1964) was a Filipino revolutionary, military leader, and statesman who served as the first president of the Philippines and led the nation's struggle for independence.[^1] He commanded Philippine forces against Spain during the Philippine Revolution (1896-1898), briefly allied with the United States during the Spanish-American War, and subsequently led Filipino forces against American colonial rule during the Philippine-American War (1899-1901).[^2] On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence from Spain at his home in Kawit, Cavite, establishing what would become Asia's first constitutional republic.[^3] His legacy remains deeply controversial due to his alleged involvement in the executions of revolutionary leaders Andrés Bonifacio and General Antonio Luna, his eventual capitulation to American forces, and his later collaboration with Japanese occupiers during World War II.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Emilio Aguinaldo was born on March 22, 1869, in Cavite el Viejo (present-day Kawit) in the province of Cavite to Carlos Aguinaldo y Jamir and Trinidad Famy y Villanueva.[^5] Nicknamed "Miong," he was the seventh of eight children in a prosperous Chinese-mestizo family that enjoyed considerable wealth and social standing in their community.[^6] His father, Carlos, served as the community's Gobernadorcillo (municipal governor) in the Spanish colonial administration, a prestigious position that reflected the family's elevated status.[^7]

Aguinaldo's early education began under the tutelage of his great-aunt before he attended the town's elementary school.[^8] He later enrolled at Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila, one of the most prestigious educational institutions in the Philippines. However, his formal education was cut short during his third year when a cholera outbreak struck in 1882, forcing him to return home.[^9] His father's death when Aguinaldo was just nine years old placed additional responsibilities on the young man's shoulders, and he chose to remain in Cavite to help his widowed mother manage the family farm rather than complete his studies.[^10]

Despite his truncated formal education, Aguinaldo demonstrated exceptional leadership qualities from an early age. At just seventeen years old, he was elected cabeza de barangay (village chief) of Binakayan, the most progressive barrio of Cavite el Viejo, a position he held for eight years representing the local residents.[^11] This early administrative experience proved invaluable in developing his organizational and leadership skills. His political ascent continued when, at the age of 25, he became Cavite el Viejo's first Gobernadorcillo Capitan Municipal (municipal governor-captain) while on a business trip to Mindoro.[^12]

The young Aguinaldo's involvement in local governance coincided with growing nationalist sentiments across the Philippines. The execution of Filipino priest-martyrs Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora in 1872 and José Rizal's influential writings had ignited Filipino consciousness about colonial oppression and the possibilities of independence. These revolutionary currents would soon sweep Aguinaldo into a movement that would transform the archipelago and his own destiny.

## Rise to Power

Aguinaldo's revolutionary career began in March 1895 when he joined the Katipunan, a secret revolutionary organization founded by Andrés Bonifacio and dedicated to achieving Philippine independence from Spain through armed force.[^13] Within this clandestine network, Aguinaldo adopted the nom de guerre "Magdalo" in honor of Mary Magdalene, distinguishing himself from other members and establishing his revolutionary identity.[^14]

When Spanish friars discovered the existence of the Katipunan in August 1896, the planned revolution was forced to begin prematurely.[^15] The Katipunan-led Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule erupted in the last week of August 1896 in San Juan del Monte (now part of Metro Manila).[^16] Initially, Aguinaldo and other Cavite rebels hesitated to join the offensive due to insufficient arms and ammunition.[^17] However, once they entered the conflict, the revolutionaries in Cavite—led by Mariano Álvarez and cousins Baldomero and Emilio Aguinaldo—achieved early and significant victories against Spanish forces.[^18]

Aguinaldo's military successes in Cavite quickly elevated his stature within the revolutionary movement. His careful planning and tactical acumen resulted in several decisive victories that demonstrated the feasibility of Filipino resistance against the colonial power. These military achievements, however, also created tensions within the revolutionary leadership, particularly with Bonifacio, who had founded the Katipunan but lacked Aguinaldo's military success and came from a lower social class.[^19]

The power struggle between the Magdalo faction (led by Aguinaldo) and the Magdiwang faction (loyal to Bonifacio) came to a head at the Tejeros Convention held on March 22, 1897, in San Francisco de Malabon, Cavite.[^20] Although Aguinaldo was occupied with military matters in Imus and not present at the convention, he was elected president of the revolutionary government.[^21] Bonifacio, humiliated by being appointed to the inferior position of Director of the Interior and challenged over his qualifications, stormed out and declared the convention results null and void.[^22]

What followed remains one of the darkest episodes in Philippine revolutionary history. Aguinaldo sent men to arrest Bonifacio, who resisted and was wounded in the process.[^23] Bonifacio and his brother Procopio were charged with treason and tried by a military tribunal composed entirely of Aguinaldo's appointees.[^24] Found guilty, the Bonifacio brothers were sentenced to death, with the order signed by Aguinaldo himself.[^25] They were executed on May 10, 1897, in the mountains of Maragondon—an act that revolutionary adviser Apolinario Mabini later characterized as "assassination...the first victory of personal ambition over true patriotism."[^26] On March 22, 1948, Aguinaldo publicly acknowledged in a letter that he had indeed ordered the execution.[^27]

## Major Achievements

### Declaration of Independence and the First Philippine Republic

Emilio Aguinaldo's most enduring achievement was his role in establishing Philippine independence and creating Asia's first constitutional republic. After negotiating the Pact of Biak-na-Bato with Spanish Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera on December 14, 1897, Aguinaldo agreed to a temporary truce.[^28] Under this agreement, the revolutionary government would dissolve, Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries would receive amnesty and an indemnity payment of 800,000 Mexican pesos, and they would go into voluntary exile in Hong Kong.[^29]

On December 27, 1897, Aguinaldo and 25 other revolutionary leaders departed from Sual, Pangasinan, aboard the steamer Uranus, arriving in Hong Kong on December 30.[^30] During his exile, Aguinaldo reorganized his revolutionary government into the "Hong Kong Junta" and later expanded it into the "Supreme Council of the Nation," maintaining organizational continuity and preparing for renewed struggle.[^31]

The outbreak of the Spanish-American War in April 1898 created a new opportunity for Philippine independence. Aguinaldo made arrangements with American consular representatives and Commodore George Dewey to return to the Philippines and assist the United States in defeating Spain.[^32] He returned to the Philippines on May 19, 1898, and immediately announced the renewal of the struggle against Spanish colonial rule.[^33]

On June 12, 1898, in one of the most significant moments in Philippine history, Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence from Spain at his ancestral home in Kawit, Cavite.[^34] The ceremony, held between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, featured the unfurling of the Philippine flag—sewn in Hong Kong by Marcela Agoncillo, Lorenza Agoncillo, and Delfina Herboza—and the first public performance of the Marcha Filipina Magdalo (later known as Lupang Hinirang), the national anthem composed by Julián Felipe and played by the San Francisco de Malabon marching band.[^35] The Act of the Declaration of Independence, prepared and read by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista in Spanish, was signed by 98 people, including an American Army officer who witnessed the proclamation.[^36]

### The Malolos Constitution and Republic

Following the declaration of independence, Aguinaldo presided over the establishment of a functioning republican government. The Malolos Congress was convened on September 15, 1898, and a committee was selected to draft a constitution for the new republic.[^37] The resulting Political Constitution of 1899, informally known as the Malolos Constitution, was promulgated on January 21, 1899, marking the first republican constitution in Asia drafted entirely by Filipinos to assert national self-determination.[^38]

On January 23, 1899, at Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan, Aguinaldo delivered his inaugural address and was sworn in as the first president of the First Philippine Republic.[^39] In his speech, he proclaimed: "Great is this day, glorious is the date; and this moment, when our beloved people rise to the apotheosis of independence, will be eternally memorable. The 23rd of January will be for the Philippines, hereafter a national feast."[^40] This established the first constitutional republic in Asia and demonstrated that Filipinos were capable of self-governance, challenging prevailing colonial narratives about Asian peoples' capacity for democracy.[^41]

### Military Leadership and Strategic Innovation

Aguinaldo demonstrated considerable military acumen throughout the revolutionary struggle. During the war against Spain, he and his forces achieved significant victories through carefully planned and well-timed conventional military operations.[^42] His early successes in Cavite proved that Filipino forces could defeat Spanish colonial troops when properly organized and led.

When the conflict with the United States began on February 4, 1899, Aguinaldo initially attempted conventional warfare against the better-equipped American forces.[^43] After suffering severe losses, he demonstrated strategic flexibility by authorizing a shift to guerrilla warfare tactics. On September 14, 1899, he accepted the advice of General Gregorio del Pilar and authorized guerrilla tactics in Bulacan, and on November 13, 1899, he formally decreed that guerrilla warfare would be the primary strategy.[^44]

Under this new approach, the Philippine Army reorganized into regional commands with "shadow" governments, waging a campaign of ambushes, raids, and surprise attacks designed to wear down American forces and influence U.S. domestic politics.[^45] Filipino guerrillas disguised themselves as civilians, blended with local populations, and achieved notable victories at Paye, Catubig, Makahambus Hill, Pulang Lupa, and Mabitac.[^46] The guerrilla campaign resulted in nearly 500 American casualties in just the first four months, demonstrating the effectiveness of Aguinaldo's strategic adaptation.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Assassination of General Antonio Luna

Beyond the execution of Bonifacio, Aguinaldo is also implicated in the death of General Antonio Luna, one of the most capable military commanders of the Philippine revolutionary forces. On June 5, 1899, Luna was brutally assassinated in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, under circumstances that strongly suggest Aguinaldo's involvement.[^48]

Luna had received a telegram from Aguinaldo ordering him to come to the new capital at Cabanatuan to form a new cabinet.[^49] Upon arrival, Luna was informed that Aguinaldo had left earlier in the day. He encountered Captain Pedro Janolino and members of Aguinaldo's Kawit presidential bodyguards—the same soldiers Luna had previously disarmed for disciplinary reasons but whom Aguinaldo had reinstated.[^50] Luna and his aide, Colonel Francisco Roman, were killed in a savage attack, with Luna suffering over 30 wounds from bolos, bayonets, and bullets.[^51]

Contemporary American newspapers reported that General Luna was "assassinated by order of Aguinaldo" and "stabbed to death by a guard selected by Aguinaldo to kill him."[^52] A letter later discovered provided evidence linking Aguinaldo to Luna's death.[^53] The assassination eliminated a military leader who had been critical of Aguinaldo's leadership and had clashed with him over military strategy, but it also deprived the revolutionary forces of one of their most competent commanders at a critical juncture in the war against the United States.

### War Crimes and Atrocities

Under Aguinaldo's leadership, Filipino forces committed numerous atrocities during the Philippine-American War. According to historical accounts, Spanish priests were mutilated before their congregations, and Filipinos who refused to support Aguinaldo were killed in large numbers.[^54] Apolinario Mabini, in his autobiography, confirmed these offenses and noted that Aguinaldo failed to punish Filipino troops who engaged in war rape, burned and looted villages, and destroyed private property.[^55]

Filipino forces subjected captured American soldiers to brutal torture, with methods including kicking, slapping, spitting, cutting off ears and noses and applying salt to the wounds, and burying captives alive.[^56] These atrocities occurred despite Aguinaldo's official orders and circulars concerning the proper treatment of prisoners, suggesting either inadequate command control or tacit approval of such practices.[^57] Filipino fighters also terrorized civilians who cooperated with American forces, creating a climate of fear in contested areas.[^58]

### Collaboration with the Japanese During World War II

Perhaps the most damaging controversy surrounding Aguinaldo's legacy is his collaboration with Japanese forces during their occupation of the Philippines in World War II. A longtime admirer of Japan, Aguinaldo sided with the Japanese invaders when they occupied the Philippines in 1941, believing that Japan would free the islands from American rule and grant immediate independence.[^59]

In January 1942, Aguinaldo met with General Masami Maeda at his Cavite residence to discuss creating a pro-Japanese provisional government.[^60] On February 1, 1942, he delivered a radio address calling upon General Douglas MacArthur and all American and Filipino troops fighting in the Battle of Bataan to surrender to the Japanese army.[^61] Following the American retreat, Aguinaldo continued his collaboration and was appointed as a member of both the provisional Council of State and the Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence under Japanese auspices.[^62]

Japan initially planned to appoint Aguinaldo as president of a Japanese puppet state, but ultimately gave him the position of head of the National Distribution Corporation, placing him in charge of rationing essential commodities for the Japanese war effort.[^63] During the Battle of Manila in 1945, members of the Marking Guerrillas resistance force arrested Aguinaldo on February 8, placing him under house arrest while the U.S. Army's Counterintelligence Corps investigated his collaboration.[^64]

On March 9, 1945, the People's Court of the Philippines charged Aguinaldo with eleven counts of treason for his "wholehearted" support and collaboration with the Empire of Japan.[^65] However, on January 28, 1948, Philippine President Manuel Roxas granted amnesty to all accused political and economic collaborators, and Aguinaldo's charges were dropped without trial.[^66]

### Allegations of Dictatorship

Critics accused Aguinaldo of becoming a dictator during his presidency of the Philippine Republic, claiming he used his power to suppress political opposition and consolidate his personal authority.[^67] The executions of Bonifacio and Luna, both potential rivals, lent credibility to accusations that Aguinaldo eliminated threats to his leadership regardless of their value to the revolutionary cause. His acceptance of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and the substantial monetary payment that accompanied it also raised questions about whether personal gain influenced his decision-making.[^68]

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Family

On January 1, 1896, Aguinaldo married his first wife, Hilaria del Rosario y Reyes (February 17, 1877 – March 6, 1921), who became an important companion during the revolutionary period.[^69] Together they had five children: Carmen Aguinaldo-Melencio, Emilio "Jun" R. Aguinaldo Jr., Maria Aguinaldo-Poblete, Cristina Aguinaldo-Suntay, and Miguel Aguinaldo.[^70] Hilaria served as the First Lady of the First Philippine Republic, supporting her husband through the tumultuous revolutionary years.

Tragically, Hilaria died of pulmonary tuberculosis on March 6, 1921, at the age of 44, leaving Aguinaldo a widower for nine years.[^71] On July 14, 1930, Aguinaldo married his second wife, Maria Agoncillo (1879–1963), at the historic Barasoain Church where he had been inaugurated as president three decades earlier.[^72] Maria Agoncillo, niece of Marcela Agoncillo who had sewn the first Philippine flag, remained with Aguinaldo until her death on May 29, 1963, less than a year before Aguinaldo himself passed away.[^73]

### Personality and Character

Historical accounts describe Aguinaldo as an ambitious and determined leader who inspired loyalty among his supporters but also engendered suspicion due to his alleged ruthlessness toward rivals. His willingness to make pragmatic compromises—from the Pact of Biak-na-Bato to his eventual oath of allegiance to the United States—revealed a flexibility that his supporters characterized as realistic statesmanship but his critics condemned as opportunism.

Aguinaldo maintained strong ties to his hometown of Kawit, Cavite throughout his life. When the American government allowed the Philippine flag to be displayed in 1919, he transformed his home into a monument to the flag, the revolution, and the declaration of independence.[^74] This house, now known as the Aguinaldo Shrine, became the site where he spent much of his retirement and ultimately where his remains would be buried.[^75]

### Later Political Activities

Despite his defeat and capture in 1901, Aguinaldo remained politically active throughout his long life. In 1935, when the Philippines became a commonwealth, he founded the National Socialist Party and ran for president against the highly popular Manuel L. Quezon of the Nacionalista Party and Gregorio Aglipay of the Republican Party.[^76] Aguinaldo announced his candidacy on June 2, 1935, with Raymundo Melliza as his running mate, presenting a 44-point platform at his acceptance speech in Cavite before an audience of approximately 5,000 people.[^77]

The campaign was bitter and contentious. Quezon's political enmity toward Aguinaldo dated back years, and Quezon repeatedly used the Luna and Bonifacio executions to damage Aguinaldo's reputation through black propaganda.[^78] In the national election, Quezon won decisively with 695,332 votes (68 percent) compared to Aguinaldo's 179,349 votes.[^79] Quezon won every province except for Aguinaldo's stronghold of Cavite and Aglipay's Ilocos Norte.[^80]

Aguinaldo refused to accept the election results, asserting they were rigged against him, and raised the issue with the United States government.[^81] His supporters in Cavite even plotted to disrupt Quezon's inauguration in November and allegedly planned an assassination attempt, though these efforts came to nothing.[^82]

## Legacy

### Impact on Philippine Nationalism

Emilio Aguinaldo's legacy has significantly influenced modern perceptions of Filipino nationalism by embodying the struggle for self-determination and resistance against imperialism.[^83] His declaration of independence on June 12, 1898, established a symbolic moment that continues to define Philippine national identity. In 1962, Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal changed the country's independence day from July 4 (commemorating independence from the United States) to June 12 to honor Aguinaldo's original declaration and symbolize a break from American colonial ties.[^84]

The establishment of the Malolos Republic demonstrated that Filipinos were capable of creating and operating democratic institutions, challenging prevailing imperialist assumptions about the supposed incapacity of colonized peoples for self-governance. As Dwight David Diestro of the University of the Philippines Los Baños noted, "Aguinaldo's leadership was instrumental in the establishment of Asia's first republic...It was a difficult time but he did what was humanly possible and to the best of his ability."[^85]

### Continuing Controversy

Filipino historians remain deeply ambiguous about Aguinaldo's role in Philippine history.[^86] While he led the revolution and served as the first president of the first republic, the controversies surrounding the executions of Bonifacio and Luna, his capitulation to American forces, his acceptance of monetary payments, and his collaboration with the Japanese have permanently complicated his historical reputation.[^87]

According to some assessments, by the late 20th century a consensus had formed that Aguinaldo was the greatest president in Philippine history for his executory role in the revolution's victory against Spain.[^88] However, this view is far from universal. Many Filipinos struggle to reconcile Aguinaldo's genuine contributions to independence with his alleged crimes and collaborations.

Emmanuel Calairo of De La Salle University Dasmariñas argues that many negative issues surrounding Aguinaldo are "interpretations" rather than established facts, particularly regarding his involvement in the Bonifacio brothers' deaths.[^89] Gilbert Macarandang, another historian, suggests that Aguinaldo should be understood in the context of his time, with Filipinos considering "Aguinaldo in his totality rather than focusing on his alleged weaknesses and failings."[^90]

### Later Life and Death

In 1950, President Elpidio Quirino appointed Aguinaldo as a member of the Council of State, where he served a full term before returning to retirement.[^91] He dedicated his remaining years to veterans' interests and welfare, maintaining connections with those who had fought in the revolutionary struggles.[^92]

Senator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. recalled visiting Aguinaldo at his residence in Kawit and asking whether, in retirement, he ever felt forgotten by the people whose welfare he had fought for—a poignant question for a man who had lived to see his legacy become deeply contested.[^93]

On February 6, 1964, General Emilio Aguinaldo died of coronary thrombosis at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City at 3:05 AM, one month before his 95th birthday.[^94] He had been confined to the hospital for 489 days and had spent most of his last four years there due to his fragile condition.[^95] Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal declared February 6 to 20, 1964, as a "period of national mourning," and Aguinaldo was accorded a state funeral.[^96] His remains are buried at the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite, the same location where he had declared Philippine independence 66 years earlier.[^97]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Aguinaldo emphasize his pivotal role in achieving Philippine independence and establishing Asia's first republic. Larry M. Henares of the Manila Standard argued that by the late 20th century, a consensus had emerged recognizing Aguinaldo as the greatest president in Philippine history for his leadership during the revolution's victory against Spain.[^98]

Academic historians like Dwight David Diestro defend Aguinaldo's legacy by contextualizing his decisions within the extraordinary pressures of revolutionary leadership. Diestro notes that Aguinaldo faced extraordinarily difficult circumstances and "did what was humanly possible and to the best of his ability" in establishing and defending the republic.[^99] This perspective emphasizes that Aguinaldo operated in an era of brutal colonial warfare where survival often required harsh decisions.

Gilbert Macarandang argues for a holistic assessment of Aguinaldo, suggesting that Filipinos should "consider Aguinaldo in his totality rather than focusing on his alleged weaknesses and failings."[^100] This view holds that judging historical figures requires understanding the moral complexities and limited options available during revolutionary periods.

Aguinaldo's supporters also point to his longevity in public service and his continued advocacy for Filipino veterans throughout his life. His transformation of his home into a shrine to independence demonstrates a genuine commitment to preserving the memory of the revolutionary struggle. His famous statement during his inaugural address—"We are no longer insurgents; we are no longer revolutionists...We are from now on Republicans; that is to say, men of law, able to fraternize with all other nations"—reflects his vision of the Philippines as a modern, lawful republic integrated into the international community.[^101]

### Negative Views

Critics of Aguinaldo present a substantially darker assessment of his legacy. The executions of Andrés Bonifacio and General Antonio Luna remain central to negative evaluations, with many historians characterizing these deaths as politically motivated murders that eliminated Aguinaldo's rivals regardless of their value to the independence movement. Apolinario Mabini, one of the revolution's intellectual leaders, called Bonifacio's execution an "assassination...the first victory of personal ambition over true patriotism," a devastating critique from a contemporary revolutionary.[^102]

Some scholars characterize Aguinaldo as a traitor rather than a hero, pointing to his oath of allegiance to the United States on April 19, 1901, which formally ended the First Republic and recognized American sovereignty over the Philippines.[^103] His subsequent collaboration with Japanese occupiers during World War II, including his February 1942 radio address calling on Filipino and American troops to surrender, reinforced perceptions that Aguinaldo prioritized his own political ambitions over genuine commitment to Philippine independence.[^104]

Historians like Constantino and Villanueva interpret the Tejeros Convention as representing class conflict within the revolution, with upper-class ilustrados like Aguinaldo wresting power from the middle and lower-class revolutionaries represented by Bonifacio.[^105] This analysis suggests that Aguinaldo's rise to power marked not just a change in leadership but a fundamental reorientation of the revolution away from its popular origins toward elite control.

Critics also emphasize Aguinaldo's failure to prevent or punish atrocities committed by forces under his command, including torture of prisoners, mutilation of priests, and massacres of civilians who refused to support his cause.[^106] His acceptance of monetary payments as part of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato raised questions about whether financial considerations influenced his willingness to negotiate with colonial powers.[^107]

The scholarly debate continues with no definitive resolution. As one assessment notes, among scholars "the question of his heroism has proved to be controversial," with historians remaining divided on whether Aguinaldo's contributions to independence outweigh his alleged crimes and collaborations.[^108]
