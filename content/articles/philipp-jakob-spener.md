## Summary

Philipp Jakob Spener was a German Lutheran theologian and the founder of Pietism, a major renewal movement within Protestantism. His work Pia Desideria (Pious Desires) called for a revival of personal devotion, Bible study, and the priesthood of all believers. He established small group meetings (collegia pietatis) for Bible study and prayer. Pietism deeply influenced later evangelical and Methodist movements.
