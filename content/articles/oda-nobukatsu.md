## Summary

Oda Nobukatsu (織田 信雄; 1558 – June 10, 1630), also known as Kitabatake Tomotoyo, was a Japanese samurai daimyo of the Azuchi-Momoyama and early Edo periods.[^1] As the second son of the legendary warlord Oda Nobunaga, Nobukatsu inherited a fractured legacy following his father's assassination in 1582. Though often characterized by historians as an incompetent general, he demonstrated remarkable political survival skills, outliving his brothers and navigating the treacherous power struggles between Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.[^2] Among Nobunaga's sons, he was the only one to survive as a daimyo into the Edo period, ensuring the continuation of the Oda bloodline through strategic alliances and timely betrayals.[^3]

---

## Early Life and Background

Oda Nobukatsu was born in 1558 at Ko'ori Castle in Niwa-Gun, presently known as Konan City in Aichi Prefecture.[^4] His mother was Ikoma Kitsuno, who was also the mother of his older brother Oda Nobutada, Nobunaga's designated heir. His childhood name was Chasen-maru, a common practice among samurai families to give children temporary names until their coming-of-age ceremony.[^5]

An interesting controversy surrounded Nobukatsu's birth order. He was Nobunaga's third biological son but was ranked above his brother Nobutaka in genealogies despite both being born in 1558, only weeks apart.[^6] Some historical accounts suggest that the lady-in-waiting made notification of Nobukatsu's birth earlier than Nobutaka's, while others maintain they were deemed second and third sons respectively because Nobukatsu's mother's lineage was ranked higher than Nobutaka's mother.[^7] This distinction would prove significant in later succession disputes.

In 1569, at approximately eleven years old, Chasen-maru was sent as an adopted son to Kitabatake Tomofusa, the head of the powerful Kitabatake family, after his father Nobunaga conquered the Ise region and subjugated the Kitabatake clan.[^8] The following year, in 1570, Nobukatsu officially became the adopted heir of the Kitabatake clan and married a daughter of the former lord, Kitabatake Tomonori.[^9] However, the true nature of this marriage was far from voluntary—it was a condition of truce forced by the Oda clan upon the defeated Kitabatake clan.[^10] This political arrangement would set the stage for one of the most controversial episodes in Nobukatsu's early career.

The young Nobukatsu grew up in the shadow of his formidable father's military campaigns, which were rapidly unifying Japan under Oda control. European missionary accounts from the period noted that among Nobunaga's sons, Nobukatsu was considered the one most similar to his father in temperament and bearing, a characterization that apparently surprised many Japanese historians given Nobukatsu's later reputation for military incompetence.[^11]

---

## Rise to Power

Nobukatsu's rise to power was marked by both brutal ambition and strategic missteps. In 1575, he officially became the head of the Kitabatake family, consolidating his position as lord of Ise Province.[^12] However, the following year revealed the ruthless methods he employed to secure complete control. In 1576, Nobukatsu orchestrated a violent purge of the Kitabatake clan leadership, killing his father-in-law Kitabatake Tomonori, imprisoning the previous lord who was his adoptive father, and eliminating several key Kitabatake supporters.[^13] The complete usurpation included the imprisonment of the former Lord of Ise and the systematic removal of anyone who might challenge his authority.[^14] This brutal takeover effectively ended the centuries-long rule of the Kitabatake clan over Ise Province, consolidating Oda control over the strategically important region.

Eager to prove himself to his father and establish his own military reputation, Nobukatsu directed an invasion of the neighboring Iga Province in 1579.[^15] The province was controlled by the Iga ikki, a confederation of semi-independent warriors and ninja clans. Nobukatsu gathered over 10,000 men and launched a three-pronged attack: 8,000 troops from the north and groups of 1,500 and 1,300 from the south.[^16] However, the campaign ended in catastrophic failure. The Iga forces, employing guerrilla tactics and intimate knowledge of the mountainous terrain, inflicted devastating losses on Nobukatsu's army, forcing a humiliating retreat.[^17]

The disaster had multiple consequences. Not only was Nobukatsu defeated, but he also lost one of his generals, and critically, he had not consulted with his father Nobunaga before launching the attack.[^18] Nobunaga was furious when he learned of his son's unauthorized and failed campaign, threatening to disown him.[^19] Nobukatsu's attack had been partly motivated by a desire to prove his merit to his father, but instead, it became a defining moment that would cement his reputation for military incompetence.

In 1581, Nobunaga himself led a massive punitive invasion of Iga Province to both avenge his son's defeat and complete the conquest. The immediate trigger for this second invasion came when two residents of Iga visited Nobunaga's stronghold in Azuchi, offering to serve as guides for an invasion in exchange for rewards.[^20] Nobunaga assembled an overwhelming force of approximately 42,000 men against the Iga defenders' maximum of 10,000, who were spread throughout the province.[^21] The Oda forces advanced systematically, torching castles, shrines, and temples, meeting relatively little organized resistance. Nobunaga personally toured the conquered province in early November 1581, then withdrew his troops, placing control in Nobukatsu's hands—a second chance to govern the region his incompetence had nearly cost the Oda clan.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Despite his reputation for military failure, Oda Nobukatsu achieved several notable accomplishments that ensured his survival and political relevance during one of Japan's most turbulent periods. His greatest achievement was perhaps his ability to navigate the complex power dynamics following his father's death, ultimately securing his family's continuity when other Oda heirs perished.

**Succession After the Honnō-ji Incident**

On June 21, 1582, the Honnō-ji Incident shattered the Oda clan's unity when Akechi Mitsuhide assassinated Nobunaga and his heir apparent, Nobutada, at Honnō-ji temple in Kyoto.[^23] The surprise deaths created an immediate succession crisis. Nobukatsu, governing Ise Province at the time, escaped the immediate violence due to his distant location.[^24] Upon hearing of Mitsuhide's betrayal, Nobukatsu marched to Tsuchiyama in Omi Province to attack the usurper, but retreated when he learned that Toyotomi Hideyoshi had already defeated Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki.[^25]

The subsequent Kiyosu Conference, attended by four senior Oda vassals including Shibata Katsuie, Niwa Nagahide, Ikeda Tsuneoki, and Hashiba Hideyoshi, determined the succession.[^26] Three names were proposed: Nobukatsu, his younger brother Nobutaka, and Hidenobu (Sanhōshi), Nobutada's three-year-old son.[^27] Ultimately, the council decided on the infant Hidenobu, with Hideyoshi's opinion being most influential in this decision.[^28] Nobukatsu was not nominated as heir, partly because he had been adopted into the Kitabatake family, but also because contemporary sources indicate he had "repeatedly committed mistakes."[^29] Nevertheless, Nobukatsu succeeded his father as lord of Owari, Mino, and Ise Provinces, controlling substantial territories.[^30]

**The Battle of Komaki and Nagakute (1584)**

In 1583, during the chaotic years following Nobunaga's death, Nobukatsu initially joined with Hideyoshi to destroy his younger brother Nobutaka, eliminating a rival claimant to the Oda legacy.[^31] However, their relationship soon became hostile. Hideyoshi's actions in offering reconciliation to three of Nobukatsu's chief retainers led Nobukatsu to become suspicious, and he ordered their execution on March 17, 1584, which gave Hideyoshi justification for attacking.[^32] Nobukatsu responded by requesting auxiliary forces from Tokugawa Ieyasu, transforming the conflict into a direct confrontation between Japan's two most powerful figures.[^33]

The ensuing Battle of Komaki and Nagakute saw Toyotomi's forces, numbering approximately 100,000 (or by some accounts 60,000) at Inuyama Castle, facing Ieyasu's much smaller force of only 17,000 men at Komakiyama Castle.[^34] During the standoff, Hideyoshi attempted to strike at Okazaki Castle, Ieyasu's main stronghold, but the maneuver resulted in Hideyoshi's defeat and Ieyasu's tactical victory.[^35] 

Though described as an incompetent general, Nobukatsu demonstrated personal martial prowess during the campaign. In the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, he wielded a 13th-century tachi of the Fukuoka Ichimonji school to slay his retainer Okada Sukesaburō (also called Okada Shigetaka), whom he suspected of treasonously siding with Hideyoshi.[^36] The sword, exhibiting a pronounced curve and wide blade measuring 69.1 centimeters in length with a curvature of 2.1 centimeters, came to be known as "Okada-giri Yoshifusa" (literally "Okada Slayer").[^37] This tachi is considered to display the greatest artistry of all Yoshifusa's works and is now designated as a national treasure, currently held at the Tokyo National Museum.[^38]

The conflict ultimately resulted in a stalemate, though Hideyoshi's forces suffered heavy casualties.[^39] Historian Rai San'yō later opined that for Tokugawa Ieyasu, the Battle of Komaki-Nagakute was his most important moment that truly propelled him to become ruler of Japan—more crucial than the Siege of Osaka or the Battle of Sekigahara.[^40] However, after more than half a year of battles, Hideyoshi persuaded Nobukatsu to make peace in early 1585, offering him security of his domains.[^41] Retainers and contemporaries viewed this submission as a failure of resolve, exacerbating the fragmentation of Oda holdings and underscoring Nobukatsu's inability to sustain prolonged campaigns or forge lasting victories.[^42]

**Survival and Adaptation**

Nobukatsu's ultimate achievement was his remarkable longevity. Among Nobunaga's sons, he was the only one to survive as a daimyo of the Edo period, and one of only three members of the Oda clan from the Sengoku period to achieve this distinction.[^43] Everyone who can now be positively identified as a descendant of Oda Nobunaga traces their lineage through Nobukatsu.[^44] This includes the Japanese figure skater Oda Nobunari, who claims descent from Nobukatsu.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Oda Nobukatsu's career was marked by a series of controversial decisions, military failures, and acts of brutality that cemented his reputation as one of the more problematic figures among Nobunaga's heirs.

**The Iga Invasion Disaster (1579)**

The 1579 invasion of Iga Province stands as Nobukatsu's most significant military failure. Eager to achieve fame and prove himself to his father, Nobukatsu directed the invasion without Nobunaga's consultation or approval.[^46] The campaign was a complete disaster—his forces were routed by Iga warriors using guerrilla tactics, he lost key generals, and the defeat brought severe rebuke from his father, who threatened to disown him.[^47] The failure was so profound that Nobunaga himself had to lead a second invasion in 1581 with overwhelming force to salvage the situation and conquer the province.[^48]

**Brutal Takeover of the Kitabatake Clan**

Perhaps the most controversial episode in Nobukatsu's rise to power was his violent consolidation of control over the Kitabatake clan. In 1576, one year after officially becoming head of the family, he orchestrated a systematic purge.[^49] This included the murder of his father-in-law Kitabatake Tomonori, the elimination of several key Kitabatake supporters, the imprisonment of the former Lord of Ise who was his adoptive father, and the complete usurpation of control for himself.[^50] The brutality of this takeover, which involved killing family members who had welcomed him through marriage and adoption, revealed a ruthless streak that shocked contemporaries and has troubled historians since.

**The Odawara Campaign Refusal (1590)**

In 1590, Nobukatsu participated in Hideyoshi's Odawara Campaign and distinguished himself in the attack on Nirayama Castle in Izu Province.[^51] However, following the successful conquest, Hideyoshi orchestrated a massive territorial reassignment. Tokugawa Ieyasu was transferred from his fief of five provinces in Tokai to a fief of eight provinces in Kanto, and Nobukatsu was to be transferred from Owari to Ieyasu's former domains.[^52] 

Nobukatsu refused to accept Hideyoshi's order to change his dominion, a decision that proved catastrophic.[^53] This defiance incurred Hideyoshi's severe displeasure, and as punishment, Nobukatsu not only lost his original domain but was also forced to become a monk under the supervision of Toyotomi retainers.[^54] He was stripped of his lands and political power, demonstrating the consequences of defying Hideyoshi's authority during the final stages of Japanese unification.[^55] This incident highlighted Nobukatsu's poor political judgment and inability to recognize when compliance was necessary for survival.

**Betrayal of the Toyotomi Clan (1614-1615)**

After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, Nobukatsu became the guardian of Toyotomi Hideyori, Hideyoshi's son and heir.[^56] This was a position of significant trust and responsibility. However, when tensions escalated between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa factions, Nobukatsu's loyalty proved ephemeral.

During the Winter Siege of Osaka in 1614, when regent Katagiri Katsumoto returned to Osaka Castle after the Bell Inscription Incident, he was suspected of having secretly allied with Ieyasu, and Nobukatsu even plotted to assassinate Katsumoto.[^57] However, once war became inevitable, Nobukatsu and many other senior vassals abandoned Osaka Castle.[^58] In 1615, amid the final confrontation, Nobukatsu betrayed the Toyotomi clan and surrendered to Tokugawa Ieyasu, prioritizing personal survival over his responsibilities as guardian.[^59]

After meeting with Ieyasu in May 1615, Nobukatsu (also referred to as Oda Yuraku in some sources) informed the Tokugawa leader that there were several factions within Osaka Castle, that war councils rarely ended conclusively, and that Yodo-dono (Hideyori's mother) generally intervened in all matters—intelligence that aided Ieyasu's military planning.[^60] Later decisions such as this fueled assessments of Nobukatsu's unreliability and poor strategic judgment, as he abandoned any residual loyalty to the Toyotomi clan under whose patronage he had previously served.[^61]

**Historical Reputation**

Contemporary and subsequent historical assessments consistently describe Nobukatsu as an incompetent general, though acknowledging he was a skilled individual warrior.[^62] The scholarly consensus emphasizes a paradox in his legacy: military incompetence coupled with remarkable political survival instincts.[^63] His reputation was so poor that when European missionaries wrote that Nobukatsu was the one most similar to Nobunaga among his sons, it reportedly surprised many Japanese historians.[^64]

## Personal Life

Details about Oda Nobukatsu's personal life are relatively sparse in historical records, with most documentation focusing on his political and military activities. However, several aspects of his family relationships and personal characteristics can be reconstructed from available sources.

**Marriage and Family**

Nobukatsu's primary marriage was politically arranged in 1570 when he married a daughter of Kitabatake Tomonori as part of the Oda clan's subjugation of the Kitabatake family.[^65] This marriage, which was a condition of truce forced upon the Kitabatake clan, would later be marred by Nobukatsu's murder of his father-in-law in 1576.[^66]

Historical sources mention that Nobukatsu had multiple children born from his wives and concubines, who were daughters of Oda clan retainers or subjugated families.[^67] His descendants divided into two primary lines: Takanaga Oda, his fifth son, inherited 30,000 koku of Yamato Uda, while Nobuyoshi Oda, his fourth son, inherited 20,000 koku of Kozuke Obata.[^68] After Nobukatsu's death in 1630, his sixth son Takanaga Oda took over as head of the family and continued the line.[^69]

One interesting detail noted in genealogical records is that Takanaga's mother was listed as "Kubo San'emon's daughter," and this woman was not listed as being either Nobukatsu's wife or concubine, suggesting the complexity of family arrangements during the period.[^70] The specific details about all his wives, concubines, and complete list of children remain incomplete in available historical records, as documentation focused more on his political role than his domestic life.

**Personality and Character**

The limited personal descriptions of Nobukatsu paint a picture of a man driven by ambition but hampered by poor judgment. His unauthorized invasion of Iga in 1579 was motivated by a desire to prove his merit to his father, revealing an eagerness for recognition that overrode strategic caution.[^71] The brutal takeover of the Kitabatake clan demonstrated ruthlessness and a willingness to betray those who had accepted him through marriage and adoption.

Contemporary accounts suggest Nobukatsu could be suspicious and impulsive. His execution of three chief retainers in 1584 based on suspicions about Hideyoshi's reconciliation offers triggered the conflict that became the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute.[^72] During the Winter Siege of Osaka, he plotted to assassinate Katagiri Katsumoto based on suspicions of betrayal, showing a pattern of acting on mistrust.[^73]

**Later Life**

After his reinstatement following the Siege of Osaka, Nobukatsu was permitted to remain a daimyo by the Tokugawa shogunate and became the lord of the Uda-Matsuyama Domain in Yamato Province (modern-day Nara Prefecture), where he reportedly lived comfortably for the remainder of his life.[^74] The domain produced 28,000 koku, providing substantial income for his household.[^75]

Nobukatsu lived in relative seclusion in Kyoto during his final years.[^76] On June 10, 1630, he died at his residence in Kitano, Kyoto, at the age of 73 (by Japanese reckoning, which counted age from conception).[^77] His death was peaceful, a stark contrast to the violent ends met by his father and many of his brothers during the tumultuous Sengoku period.

## Legacy

Oda Nobukatsu's legacy presents a fascinating paradox: reviled by contemporaries and historians as incompetent, yet ultimately successful in the most fundamental measure—survival and the continuation of his bloodline. His impact on Japanese history, while less dramatic than his father's, proved more enduring in genealogical terms.

**Survival and Continuity of the Oda Line**

Nobukatsu's most significant legacy is serving as the sole conduit for the Oda Nobunaga bloodline into the modern era. Among all of Nobunaga's sons, Nobukatsu alone survived as a daimyo of the Edo period, and he was one of only three members of the Oda clan from the Sengoku period to achieve this distinction.[^78] Everyone who can now be positively identified as a descendant of Oda Nobunaga traces their ancestry through Nobukatsu.[^79]

His bloodline extends directly to modern times. Nobukatsu's descendants inherited positions and territories that persisted through the Edo period. The Uda-Matsuyama Domain was dissolved in 1695 due to internal disturbances, but Nobukatsu's descendants moved to Kaibara in Tamba Province (now Kaibara Chō, Hyōgo Prefecture), where they retained a 20,000-koku fief until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.[^80] His descendant Oda Nobutoshi, and Nobutoshi's son Oda Suemaru, actually served as provincial lords at the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1868.[^81] The present "head of the Oda family" descended from Nobukatsu, and Japanese figure skater Oda Nobunari claims to be among his descendants.[^82]

**Political Legacy**

Nobukatsu's political career inadvertently shaped the power dynamics that led to Tokugawa dominance. His alliance with Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584 provided Ieyasu with both legitimacy and opportunity. Historian Rai San'yō argued that this battle, not Sekigahara or the Siege of Osaka, was Ieyasu's most important moment that propelled him to rule Japan.[^83] By providing the pretext and alliance for this confrontation with Hideyoshi, Nobukatsu unintentionally strengthened Ieyasu's position and reputation.

His eventual betrayal of the Toyotomi clan during the Siege of Osaka demonstrated the fragility of loyalties during the transition from the Azuchi-Momoyama to the Edo period. His intelligence provided to Ieyasu about internal divisions within Osaka Castle contributed to the Tokugawa victory that definitively ended the Toyotomi line and established the shogunate that would rule Japan for over 250 years.[^84]

**Cultural Legacy**

The Okada-giri Yoshifusa sword, which Nobukatsu used to slay Okada Sukesaburō during the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, remains a designated national treasure of Japan.[^85] Currently housed at the Tokyo National Museum, the 13th-century tachi represents one of the finest examples of the Fukuoka Ichimonji school's artistry.[^86] The weapon serves as a tangible connection to both Nobukatsu's personal history and the broader military culture of the Sengoku period.

**Territorial Administration**

As the first lord of the Uda-Matsuyama Domain in Yamato Province, Nobukatsu established administrative patterns that his descendants maintained for generations.[^87] Though the domain was eventually abolished in 1695, his family continued to hold significant fiefs, demonstrating effective governance that allowed his line to persist through multiple political transitions.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite his reputation for incompetence, some historians and scholars have found aspects of Oda Nobukatsu's career worthy of praise, particularly his survival instincts and political adaptability.

**Survival as Success**

Modern historians have increasingly recognized that Nobukatsu's ultimate survival represents a form of success in itself. During one of Japan's most violent and unstable periods, when powerful warlords and their heirs were regularly assassinated, betrayed, or forced into suicide, Nobukatsu managed to live to age 73 and die peacefully.[^88] He navigated the treacherous power struggles following his father's death, the rise of Hideyoshi, and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, adapting his loyalties and strategies to survive each transition.

Some scholars argue that dismissing Nobukatsu as merely "incompetent" oversimplifies a more nuanced reality. His ability to read political situations and switch allegiances at critical moments—from Hideyoshi to Ieyasu and back, then ultimately to Ieyasu again—demonstrates a pragmatic intelligence that ensured his continuity when more "honorable" or rigid approaches might have resulted in his destruction.[^89]

**Military Skill vs. Strategic Judgment**

Historical sources consistently note that while Nobukatsu may have been an incompetent general, he was a skilled warrior.[^90] His personal combat prowess, demonstrated by his slaying of Okada Sukesaburō with the sword that became a national treasure, indicates martial ability even if his strategic and tactical judgment was poor.[^91] This distinction suggests that his failures stemmed not from cowardice or inability to fight, but from deficiencies in planning, patience, and military judgment.

**Genealogical Contribution**

From a dynastic perspective, Nobukatsu's greatest achievement was ensuring the continuation of the Oda bloodline. All modern descendants of Oda Nobunaga trace their ancestry through Nobukatsu, making him the essential link between one of Japan's most famous historical figures and the present day.[^92] In aristocratic and genealogical terms, this represents profound success regardless of his other failings.

**European Perspectives**

Interestingly, European missionaries who observed the period noted that Nobukatsu was considered the son most similar to Nobunaga among all his children, a characterization that surprised Japanese historians but suggests that foreign observers may have perceived qualities in him that Japanese contemporaries did not recognize or value.[^93] This hints at possible cultural differences in assessing leadership and character.

### Negative Views

The predominant historical assessment of Oda Nobukatsu remains overwhelmingly critical, with scholars across centuries highlighting his incompetence, poor judgment, and moral failings.

**Military Incompetence**

The consensus among historians firmly establishes Nobukatsu as an incompetent general.[^94] His unauthorized and catastrophically failed invasion of Iga Province in 1579 serves as the primary evidence for this assessment. Gathering over 10,000 troops for an invasion without consulting his father, then suffering a humiliating defeat against guerrilla forces, demonstrated both poor planning and inadequate command.[^95] The fact that Nobunaga had to personally lead a second invasion with four times the forces to salvage the situation underscores the magnitude of Nobukatsu's failure.

His conduct during the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute further reinforced this reputation. While Tokugawa Ieyasu managed the strategic aspects of the campaign, Nobukatsu's contributions were largely limited to providing the casus belli and personal combat. His eventual capitulation to Hideyoshi's peace offers, which contemporaries viewed as a failure of resolve, demonstrated his inability to sustain prolonged military campaigns.[^96]

**Moral Criticisms**

Historians have been particularly harsh regarding Nobukatsu's pattern of betrayals and brutality. The 1576 massacre of the Kitabatake clan leadership, including his father-in-law and adoptive father, represents a profound violation of the familial bonds that were supposed to accompany adoption and marriage alliances.[^97] While ruthlessness was not uncommon during the Sengoku period, the systematic nature of this purge and the betrayal of those who had accepted him into their family drew particular criticism.

His ultimate betrayal of the Toyotomi clan during the Siege of Osaka, when he had been entrusted as guardian of Hideyoshi's son Hideyori, represents another serious moral failing in the eyes of many historians.[^98] Not only did he abandon his ward during the crisis, but he actively provided intelligence to the Tokugawa forces that contributed to the destruction of those he was supposed to protect.[^99] This episode has led scholars to characterize him as fundamentally unreliable and willing to sacrifice honor for survival.

**Poor Strategic Judgment**

Beyond military incompetence, historians have criticized Nobukatsu's broader strategic judgment. His refusal to accept the domain transfer following the Odawara Campaign in 1590, which resulted in him losing all his territories and being forced into monkhood, demonstrated a catastrophic inability to recognize political reality.[^100] At a moment when compliance would have maintained his power and position, his stubborn refusal led to complete dispossession.

Similarly, his execution of three chief retainers in 1584 based on suspicions about Hideyoshi's overtures triggered the conflict that became the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute.[^101] While the battle itself became historically significant, Nobukatsu's impulsive action based on suspicion rather than confirmed intelligence exemplified the poor judgment that characterized his career.

**Contrast with His Father**

Perhaps the harshest criticism comes from inevitable comparison with his legendary father. Oda Nobunaga was one of the three great unifiers of Japan, renowned for his military genius, innovative tactics, and ruthless effectiveness. Nobukatsu, by contrast, repeatedly demonstrated the opposite qualities—military failure, strategic confusion, and survival through accommodation rather than dominance. The fact that he was not nominated as heir at the Kiyosu Conference "partly because he had repeatedly committed mistakes" represents a damning contemporary assessment by those who knew him best.[^102]

Historians note the tragic irony that the bloodline of one of Japan's greatest military geniuses survived solely through a son characterized as incompetent, suggesting that in the chaotic Sengoku period, survival sometimes rewarded caution and flexibility over brilliance and boldness.[^103]

## Famous Quotes

Historical records contain very few direct quotations from Oda Nobukatsu, as documentation focused primarily on his actions rather than his words. The sources available do not preserve speeches, letters, or sayings attributed to him with the same frequency as other major figures of the period. However, the following contextual statements reflect his historical position:

> "A hero is someone who works for the good of others, not profit for selfish glory."

*Attributed to Nobukatsu in the video game Samurai Warriors—a modern fictional portrayal rather than a verified historical quote, but reflects how later culture has attempted to rehabilitate his image.*[^104]

> "Among Nobunaga's sons, he was the one most similar to Nobunaga."

*Observation by European missionaries, as recorded in period documents—a characterization that reportedly surprised Japanese historians given Nobukatsu's reputation for incompetence.*[^105]

> "He had repeatedly committed mistakes."

*Contemporary assessment explaining why Nobukatsu was not nominated as heir at the Kiyosu Conference in 1582—a damning evaluation from those who knew him best.*[^106]

The lack of preserved quotations from Nobukatsu himself may reflect his relatively minor status compared to more prominent figures like his father, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu, whose words were more carefully recorded. His legacy rests primarily on his actions—both his failures and his ultimate survival—rather than any particular wisdom or memorable statements he may have made.
