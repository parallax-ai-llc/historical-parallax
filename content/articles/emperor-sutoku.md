## Summary

Emperor Sutoku (崇徳天皇, 1119-1164) was the 75th emperor of Japan, reigning from 1123 to 1142 during the late Heian period. His life was marked by political intrigue, forced abdication, and exile following his defeat in the Hōgen Rebellion of 1156. After his death in exile on the island of Shikoku, he became one of Japan's most feared onryō (vengeful spirits), blamed for centuries of calamities that befell the imperial court and the nation. His transformation from emperor to demon-god represents one of the most dramatic falls from grace in Japanese history, and his legend continues to influence Japanese culture, literature, and religious practices to this day.

---

## Early Life and Background

Emperor Sutoku was born on July 7, 1119, as the first son of Emperor Toba and Fujiwara no Tamako (also known as Empress待賢門院 Taikenmon-in). However, his birth was immediately clouded by scandalous rumors that would haunt him throughout his life. It was widely believed at court that Sutoku was actually the son of his grandfather, the retired Emperor Shirakawa, who had allegedly conducted an affair with Tamako before she became Emperor Toba's consort.[^1]

Emperor Toba himself reportedly referred to Sutoku not as "my son" but as "the child of my uncle" (叔父子, ojigo), a devastating epithet that revealed the emperor's belief that Sutoku was his own father's illegitimate child.[^2] This rumor, whether true or false, poisoned the relationship between father and son from the beginning and would have profound consequences for Sutoku's political future.

Despite these inauspicious beginnings, Sutoku was raised as a prince in the imperial court and received the education befitting his station. At the age of three, in 1123, he was placed on the throne by the retired Emperor Shirakawa, who continued to exercise actual political power through the system of insei (cloistered rule), whereby retired emperors governed from behind the scenes.[^3]

Young Sutoku's childhood was spent in the rarefied atmosphere of the Heian court, where he was trained in classical Chinese literature, Japanese poetry, calligraphy, and the ceremonial duties required of an emperor. He showed particular talent in poetry, a skill that would later provide him solace during his years of exile. The Heian period was characterized by elaborate court ceremonies, aesthetic refinement, and the political dominance of the Fujiwara clan, though by Sutoku's time, the authority of retired emperors had begun to supersede that of the Fujiwara regents.[^4]

---

## Rise to Power

Sutoku ascended to the throne on February 25, 1123, at the tender age of four, following the abdication of his father, Emperor Toba. However, this "rise to power" was entirely nominal, as all real authority rested with his great-grandfather, the retired Emperor Shirakawa, who had perfected the system of cloistered rule. Shirakawa had orchestrated Sutoku's enthronement as part of his strategy to maintain control over the imperial succession and court politics.[^5]

During Sutoku's reign, which lasted nineteen years, he served essentially as a figurehead. The retired Emperor Shirakawa continued to dominate court affairs until his death in 1129, at which point Sutoku's father, the retired Emperor Toba, assumed control of the cloistered government. This meant that Sutoku, despite being the reigning emperor, had virtually no independent political power or decision-making authority.[^6]

The situation became even more complicated after 1129. Emperor Toba, who harbored deep resentment toward Sutoku due to the rumors surrounding his birth, actively worked to diminish his son's position and prospects. Toba's favorite consort, Fujiwara no Nariko (known as Bifukumon-in), exercised considerable influence over the retired emperor and encouraged him in his antipathy toward Sutoku.[^7]

In 1142, Emperor Toba forced Sutoku to abdicate in favor of Sutoku's younger half-brother, who became Emperor Konoe. Sutoku was only twenty-three years old at the time. Initially, Sutoku expected to follow the precedent of previous emperors and become a cloistered emperor himself, exercising power from behind the scenes when his son (Emperor Konoe) eventually had children. However, Emperor Toba had no intention of allowing Sutoku any political role.[^8]

Sutoku's "rise to power" was thus characterized by powerlessness, manipulation by his elders, and ultimately, forced retirement at a young age. He became a retired emperor without the accompanying political authority, a status that left him frustrated and marginalized within the very court where he had once sat on the throne.[^9]

## Major Achievements

Given the constraints under which Emperor Sutoku lived, his achievements were primarily cultural and religious rather than political or military. However, these contributions, particularly in the realm of poetry, have ensured his lasting place in Japanese cultural history.

### Poetic Legacy

Emperor Sutoku is best remembered as one of the great imperial poets of the Heian period. He was an accomplished practitioner of waka (traditional Japanese poetry), and his poems were included in several imperial anthologies. His most famous poem, included in the Hyakunin Isshu (One Hundred Poets, One Poem Each), reflects the melancholy that would come to define his life:

> "Se wo hayami / Iwa ni sekaruru / Takigawa no / Warete mo sue ni / Awamu to zo omou"
> 
> (Though the swift current / Is broken as it strikes the rocks / The waterfall's flow / Will unite again below / Such is my hope for us)[^10]

This poem, ostensibly about separated lovers who hope to reunite, takes on added poignancy when considered in light of Sutoku's later exile and separation from the capital and court life he loved.

During his years as emperor and retired emperor, Sutoku participated actively in poetry contests (utaawase) and patronized poets and scholars. He commissioned the compilation of the Shika Wakashū, an imperial anthology of Japanese poetry, though political circumstances prevented its official recognition during his lifetime.[^11]

### Religious Devotion

After his abdication, Sutoku devoted himself increasingly to Buddhist practices. He took the tonsure (Buddhist vows) and spent considerable time copying sutras by hand, a meritorious act in Buddhist tradition. According to historical records, during his exile he copied the entire Buddhist canon (五部大乗経, Gobu Daijōkyō - Five Great Mahayana Sutras) with his own blood mixed with the ink, intending to dedicate this pious act to the protection of the nation and his own salvation.[^12]

This extraordinary act of devotion, which took years to complete, represented both Sutoku's deep religious faith and his desperate desire to find meaning and purpose in his exile. When he attempted to donate these sacred texts to temples in the capital, however, Emperor Go-Shirakawa rejected them, suspecting they might be cursed. This rejection, according to legend, was the final insult that transformed Sutoku from a pious monk into a vengeful spirit.[^13]

### Cultural Patronage

During his time at court, both as emperor and retired emperor, Sutoku participated in the refined cultural life of the Heian aristocracy. He supported scholars, calligraphers, and artists, maintaining the traditions of imperial cultural patronage that characterized the period. His court, though politically marginalized, remained a center of aesthetic and literary activity.[^14]

### Administrative Continuity

Despite his lack of real political power, Sutoku's nineteen-year reign provided stability and continuity in ceremonial and administrative functions. He performed the ritual duties required of an emperor, maintained court ceremonies, and upheld the symbolic dignity of the imperial institution during a period when actual governance was conducted by retired emperors and their advisors.[^15]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Emperor Sutoku's life was dominated by controversy, from the scandal of his birth to the rebellion that led to his exile and eventual transformation into a demonic figure in Japanese folklore.

### The Question of Legitimacy

The most persistent controversy surrounding Sutoku was the question of his parentage. The widespread belief that he was actually the son of his grandfather, Emperor Shirakawa, rather than his nominal father, Emperor Toba, cast a shadow over his entire life. Whether this rumor was true or merely malicious gossip propagated by political enemies, it effectively delegitimized Sutoku in the eyes of his father and many at court.[^16]

Modern historians debate the truth of these allegations. Some argue that the affair between Shirakawa and Tamako was historical fact, pointing to contemporary sources that reference it openly. Others suggest it may have been political slander designed to justify Toba's mistreatment of Sutoku and to provide a pretext for passing over him in the succession.[^17]

### The Hōgen Rebellion

The defining controversy of Sutoku's life was his involvement in the Hōgen Rebellion of 1156, a brief but devastating conflict that marked a turning point in Japanese history. After Emperor Konoe died unexpectedly in 1155 without an heir, a succession dispute erupted. Sutoku hoped that his own son would be named emperor, which would have given him authority as a cloistered emperor. Instead, Emperor Toba chose his fourth son, who became Emperor Go-Shirakawa.[^18]

When Emperor Toba died in 1156, the simmering tensions exploded into armed conflict. Sutoku allied himself with the powerful Fujiwara no Yorinaga and parts of the Minamoto and Taira warrior clans, while Emperor Go-Shirakawa assembled his own coalition. The rebellion lasted only a few days in July 1156, ending with Sutoku's decisive defeat.[^19]

Critics of Sutoku view his participation in the rebellion as an act of treasonous ambition, an attempt to overthrow the legitimate emperor and seize power for himself. The conflict resulted in the burning of parts of Kyoto and numerous deaths, including many aristocrats who were executed in the aftermath—a shocking violation of the Heian court's long tradition of not executing nobles.[^20]

### The Curse and Vengeful Spirit

After his defeat, Sutoku was exiled to Sanuki Province (modern-day Kagawa Prefecture) on the island of Shikoku, where he lived in isolation for the remaining eight years of his life. According to later accounts, Sutoku died filled with rage and resentment, having bitten through his own tongue and written curses against the imperial family in his blood before his death on September 14, 1164.[^21]

Following his death, Sutoku was transformed in popular imagination into one of Japan's most powerful and feared onryō (vengeful spirits). He was blamed for numerous calamities that befell Japan in subsequent centuries, including fires, earthquakes, droughts, epidemics, and political upheavals. The Genpei War, which erupted in 1180 and led to the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, was attributed to Sutoku's curse, as were later conflicts and disasters.[^22]

This association with supernatural vengeance and demonic power, while perhaps increasing Sutoku's posthumous fame, also represents a profound criticism of his character and legacy. In traditional Japanese thought, becoming an onryō indicated that one had died with unresolved grievances and harbored malicious intentions toward the living. Whether Sutoku deserved this reputation or was merely a convenient scapegoat for national misfortunes remains a subject of debate.[^23]

### Political Misjudgment

Historians have also criticized Sutoku's political judgment in participating in the Hōgen Rebellion. Some argue that he was manipulated by Fujiwara no Yorinaga and other advisors who convinced him that armed rebellion was his only option, when patience and political maneuvering might have served him better. His willingness to resort to military force helped legitimize the role of warrior clans in court politics, contributing to the eventual eclipse of imperial power by the samurai class.[^24]

---

## Personal Life

Details of Emperor Sutoku's personal life reveal a complex figure marked by loneliness, artistic sensibility, and ultimately, profound bitterness.

### Family and Relationships

Sutoku married Fujiwara no Seishi (also known as Empress Kōkamon-in), daughter of Fujiwara no Nagazane, though the marriage appears to have been more political than affectionate. Together they had one son, Prince Shigehito, who became Sutoku's primary concern and the focus of his dynastic ambitions. Sutoku desperately wanted his son to become emperor, which would have given him the authority of a cloistered emperor, but this hope was never realized.[^25]

His relationship with his father, Emperor Toba, was characterized by coldness and hostility. Toba never accepted Sutoku as his true son and actively worked against his interests throughout his life. This paternal rejection deeply wounded Sutoku and contributed to the psychological isolation he experienced at court.[^26]

In contrast, Sutoku appears to have maintained better relationships with his mother, Empress Taikenmon-in, though even this connection was complicated by the scandal surrounding his birth. Historical records suggest that his mother's position at court was also diminished after Toba's new favorite, Bifukumon-in, gained ascendancy.[^27]

### Personality and Character

Contemporary accounts and Sutoku's own poetry suggest a man of refined sensibilities and deep emotions. He was known for his melancholic temperament, perhaps unsurprising given the circumstances of his life. His poetry reveals someone who felt keenly the transience of worldly glory and the pain of separation and loss.[^28]

During his years of exile in Sanuki, Sutoku lived a austere, monastic life. He devoted himself to Buddhist practices, growing out his hair and nails (which, according to legend, became increasingly demonic in appearance), and spending his days copying sutras. Visitors described him as increasingly bitter and withdrawn, consumed by his grievances against those who had wronged him.[^29]

### Cultural Interests

Despite his political troubles, Sutoku maintained his love of literature and the arts throughout his life. In addition to his poetry, he was accomplished in calligraphy—his hand-copied sutras were reportedly beautiful works of art, even if they were rejected by the court. He also enjoyed music, particularly the biwa (Japanese lute), and was knowledgeable about Buddhist philosophy and Chinese classics.[^30]

### Life in Exile

Sutoku's eight years of exile in Sanuki were marked by hardship and deprivation. He was housed in modest accommodations, far from the luxuries of the imperial court. He had few attendants and limited contact with the outside world. Despite these conditions, he maintained his dignity and continued his religious devotions, though his mood grew increasingly dark as the years passed and it became clear he would never be allowed to return to the capital.[^31]

According to some accounts, local people in Sanuki initially feared and avoided the exiled emperor, though over time some came to pity him. After his death, local legends developed around the places associated with his exile, and he became a figure of tragic romance in regional folklore.[^32]

---

## Legacy

Emperor Sutoku's legacy is one of the most complex and multifaceted in Japanese history, encompassing literary achievement, political tragedy, and supernatural terror in equal measure.

### The Great Onryō

Sutoku's most enduring legacy is his reputation as one of the "Three Great Onryō of Japan" (日本三大怨霊), alongside Sugawara no Michizane and Taira no Masakado. For centuries after his death, Sutoku was blamed for disasters and calamities throughout Japan. Court records from the late Heian period and Kamakura period are filled with references to prayers, rituals, and shrine dedications intended to appease Sutoku's angry spirit.[^33]

This reputation had profound effects on Japanese religion and culture. The Shiramine Shrine was established in Kyoto in 1868 to enshrine Sutoku's spirit and transform him from a vengeful demon into a protective deity—an effort to finally pacify his rage more than seven hundred years after his death. Similar shrines and memorial sites were established in Sanuki (Kagawa Prefecture), where he spent his exile.[^34]

### Literary and Cultural Impact

Beyond his fearsome supernatural reputation, Sutoku has been a recurring figure in Japanese literature, drama, and art. His story has been retold in numerous forms:

- **Noh Drama**: Several noh plays feature Sutoku's ghost, including "Matsuyama Tengu," which depicts him as a tengu (supernatural creature) haunting the mountains.
- **Medieval Literature**: The "Hōgen Monogatari" (Tale of the Hōgen Era) provides a detailed account of the rebellion, portraying Sutoku as a tragic figure.
- **Edo Period Fiction**: Ghost stories and supernatural tales featuring Sutoku were popular during the Tokugawa period.
- **Modern Media**: Sutoku appears in contemporary manga, anime, and novels as a powerful supernatural being.[^35]

His most famous poem remains a staple of Japanese cultural education, included in the Hyakunin Isshu card game that generations of Japanese children have played. This ensures that even those unfamiliar with his political history know him as a poet of the Heian court.[^36]

### Political and Historical Significance

The Hōgen Rebellion, though brief, marked a crucial turning point in Japanese history. It represented the first time in centuries that a succession dispute was settled by military force rather than political maneuvering. The conflict demonstrated the growing power of the warrior clans (particularly the Minamoto and Taira) and foreshadowed the end of the aristocratic Heian period and the beginning of warrior rule that would characterize medieval Japan.[^37]

Sutoku's defeat and exile also illustrated the ruthlessness that could lie beneath the refined surface of Heian court culture. The execution of nobles following the rebellion broke a long-standing taboo and signaled a new, harsher political era. In this sense, Sutoku's personal tragedy was emblematic of larger historical transformations.[^38]

### Religious Significance

Sutoku's transformation from emperor to Buddhist monk to vengeful spirit to protective deity represents a fascinating case study in Japanese religious thought. His story illustrates the traditional belief that those who die with strong grievances can become dangerous supernatural forces, but also that through proper ritual and respect, even the most fearsome spirits can be transformed into benevolent protectors.[^39]

The enormous effort expended over centuries to appease Sutoku's spirit through prayers, rituals, and shrine dedications demonstrates the seriousness with which the Japanese court and people took the threat of spiritual retribution. This aspect of his legacy speaks to deeper beliefs about justice, grievance, and the relationship between the living and the dead in Japanese culture.[^40]

### Regional Identity

In Kagawa Prefecture (the former Sanuki Province), Sutoku has become an important figure in local history and identity. Tourist sites, museums, and cultural centers commemorate his exile there, and he is remembered not primarily as a demon but as a tragic figure of nobility and learning who found himself far from home. This regional memory provides a counterpoint to his more fearsome national reputation.[^41]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some scholars and commentators have viewed Emperor Sutoku with sympathy, seeing him as a victim of circumstances beyond his control rather than a villain or demon.

**Victim of Political Machinations**: Many historians emphasize that Sutoku was essentially powerless throughout his life, a pawn in the political games of more powerful figures. The scandal surrounding his birth was not his fault, and his father's rejection of him was cruel and unjust. From this perspective, Sutoku deserves pity rather than condemnation.[^42]

**Talented Poet and Scholar**: Sutoku's literary achievements are undeniable, and some commentators focus on this aspect of his legacy rather than his political failures. Modern literary scholars have praised his poetry for its emotional depth and technical sophistication, arguing that he deserves recognition as one of the significant poets of the Heian period.[^43]

**Religiously Devout**: Sutoku's dedication to Buddhist practice, particularly his copying of sutras in his own blood, has been interpreted by some as evidence of genuine piety and a desire for redemption. Buddhist scholars have noted that such extreme devotion reflected sincere religious commitment, even if his offerings were rejected by the court.[^44]

**Symbol of Injustice**: Modern interpreters have sometimes seen Sutoku as a symbol of the injustices inherent in hereditary power systems. His story illustrates how court intrigue, family dysfunction, and political ambition could destroy an individual, regardless of that person's character or abilities. From this perspective, he represents all those who have been crushed by systems they didn't create and couldn't control.[^45]

**Misunderstood Figure**: Some recent historical work has attempted to rehabilitate Sutoku's reputation, arguing that many of the more demonic aspects of his legend were exaggerations or inventions by later chroniclers looking for a supernatural explanation for national disasters. These scholars suggest that the historical Sutoku was likely a frustrated but not particularly villainous figure whose image was distorted by centuries of superstition.[^46]

### Negative Views

Other scholars and traditional sources have been more critical of Emperor Sutoku, emphasizing his role in political violence and his frightening posthumous reputation.

**Ambitious Rebel**: Traditional historical accounts often portray Sutoku as an ambitious figure whose desire for power led him to rebel against the legitimate emperor. From this perspective, his participation in the Hōgen Rebellion was treasonous and deserving of punishment. The violence and destruction that resulted from the conflict were blamed on his ambition and poor judgment.[^47]

**Dangerous Spirit**: For much of Japanese history, Sutoku was viewed primarily through the lens of fear—he was the vengeful spirit whose supernatural rage threatened the nation. Religious texts and court documents treated him as a genuine spiritual danger, not a tragic figure deserving sympathy. This view emphasized the need for protective rituals and appeasement rather than historical understanding.[^48]

**Poor Political Judgment**: Some historians have criticized Sutoku's decision-making, arguing that he was politically naive and allowed himself to be manipulated by advisors like Fujiwara no Yorinaga. A more skilled politician might have found ways to work within the system rather than resorting to armed rebellion, which had no realistic chance of success given the balance of forces.[^49]

**Contribution to Warrior Dominance**: Critical scholars note that the Hōgen Rebellion, in which Sutoku played a central role, helped legitimize the involvement of warrior clans in imperial politics. This ultimately contributed to the decline of imperial authority and the rise of the samurai class, which dominated Japan for the next seven centuries. From this perspective, Sutoku's actions, however understandable personally, had negative consequences for the imperial institution.[^50]

**Self-Destructive Behavior**: Some psychological and historical analyses have suggested that Sutoku's later behavior—his extreme asceticism, his copying of sutras in blood, and his alleged death curses—indicate a personality that embraced victimhood and resentment rather than seeking reconciliation or acceptance. These critics argue that his transformation into an onryō was as much a product of his own choices and mental state as of external injustices.[^51]

## Famous Quotes

### By Emperor Sutoku

> "Se wo hayami / Iwa ni sekaruru / Takigawa no / Warete mo sue ni / Awamu to zo omou" (Though the swift current is broken as it strikes the rocks, the waterfall's flow will unite again below—such is my hope for us)

This waka poem, included in the Hyakunin Isshu, is Sutoku's most famous verse. While ostensibly about separated lovers, it resonates with profound poignancy when read as reflecting his own separation from court life and power.[^52]

> "I shall become a great demon of Japan and bring disorder to the realm. I shall take the emperor and make him a commoner, and make commoners into emperors!"

According to the Hōgen Monogatari and later legends, these were among Sutoku's dying words, spoken as he cursed the imperial family. Modern historians debate whether he actually said this or whether it was added by later chroniclers to explain his transformation into an onryō.[^53]

### About Emperor Sutoku

> "He was called 'the child of my uncle' by the emperor [Toba], who did not regard him as his own son."

From the historical chronicle Imakagami, this passage reveals the cruel epithet that haunted Sutoku throughout his life and explains much of his father's hostility toward him.[^54]

> "The retired emperor [Sutoku] copied the Five Great Mahayana Sutras with his own hand, mixing his blood with the ink, and attempted to dedicate them for the protection of the nation. However, they were not accepted."

From the Gukansho, a historical text by Jien, this describes Sutoku's desperate attempt at religious devotion and the rejection that allegedly transformed him into a vengeful spirit.[^55]

> "There has never been an onryō more fearsome than the spirit of Emperor Sutoku of Sanuki."

A sentiment expressed in various forms throughout medieval Japanese texts, reflecting the terror with which Sutoku's ghost was regarded for centuries after his death.[^56]
