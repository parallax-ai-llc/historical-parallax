## Summary

Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat was the third President of Egypt, serving from October 15, 1970, until his assassination on October 6, 1981. A close confidant of Gamal Abdel Nasser and a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk I in 1952, Sadat transformed Egypt's political orientation from Soviet alignment to Western partnership. He is best known for his unprecedented peace initiative with Israel, culminating in the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, for which he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. His bold diplomatic moves, combined with the 1973 October War, reshaped the Middle Eastern political landscape, though they also made him deeply controversial in the Arab world and ultimately cost him his life.

## Early Life and Background

Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat was born on December 25, 1918, in Mit Abu al-Kum, a small village in the Monufia Governorate of the Nile Delta region of Egypt.[^1] He came from a relatively poor family with mixed Egyptian and Sudanese heritage, giving him a darker complexion that distinguished him from Egypt's lighter-skinned elite and with which he would later identify as a source of pride and connection to Africa.[^2] His father was a government clerk who worked in the Sudan, which was then part of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium, while his mother came from an Egyptian-Sudanese background.[^3]

Growing up during the period of British colonial rule over Egypt, Sadat's childhood was shaped by the nationalist sentiments that permeated Egyptian society in the early twentieth century.[^4] The British occupation, which had begun in 1882 and continued through various forms of control and influence, created a generation of Egyptians who deeply resented foreign domination.[^5] Young Sadat attended local Islamic schools where he received traditional religious education alongside secular subjects, immersing himself in the stories of Egyptian resistance to foreign occupation.[^6]

The early influences on Sadat's political consciousness included the nationalist uprisings of 1919 against British rule and the writings and speeches of Egyptian nationalist leaders.[^7] He was particularly inspired by figures who advocated for Egyptian independence and Arab dignity in the face of European imperialism.[^8] These formative experiences would shape his lifelong commitment to Egyptian sovereignty and his complex relationship with both Western powers and fellow Arab nations.[^9]

In pursuit of advancement and service to his country, Sadat attended the Royal Military Academy in Cairo, where he enrolled in 1936 following the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty that opened the military academy to young men from lower-middle-class backgrounds for the first time.[^10] At the academy, he received military training and education that would prove instrumental in his future political career. It was here, crucially, that he met Gamal Abdel Nasser and other young officers who would later form the Free Officers Movement.[^11] These relationships, forged in the shared resentment of British occupation and the desire to modernize Egypt, would define Egyptian politics for the next several decades.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Sadat's path to the presidency was long and circuitous, marked by both setbacks and strategic positioning. After graduating from the Royal Military Academy in 1938, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and posted to the Signal Corps.[^13] However, his real passion lay not in routine military service but in revolutionary politics aimed at ending British control of Egypt.[^14] During World War II, Sadat became involved in clandestine activities against the British, believing that Egypt's occupiers' difficulties presented opportunities for Egyptian independence.[^15]

His underground activities led to multiple imprisonments during the 1940s. He was first arrested in 1942 for conspiring with German agents, as some Egyptian nationalists believed that the Axis powers might help liberate Egypt from British rule.[^16] He was imprisoned again in 1946 in connection with the assassination of Amin Osman Pasha, a pro-British Egyptian politician, though he was later acquitted.[^17] These prison years, far from deterring him, deepened his commitment to the nationalist cause and provided him time for reading and reflection that would influence his later political philosophy.[^18]

Following his release and reinstatement in the army, Sadat rejoined his former comrades in the Free Officers Movement, a secret organization of military officers led by Gamal Abdel Nasser.[^19] On July 23, 1952, this group executed a military coup that overthrew King Farouk I and established a republic, with Sadat playing a significant role by delivering the first radio announcement of the revolution to the Egyptian people.[^20] This moment marked the beginning of a new era in Egyptian history and Sadat's emergence onto the national political stage.[^21]

During Nasser's presidency (1956-1970), Sadat served in various capacities that kept him close to power while never threatening Nasser's supremacy.[^22] He was appointed Minister of State in 1954, served as president of the National Assembly from 1960 to 1968, and was appointed Vice President in 1964 and again in December 1969.[^23] This pattern of loyal service without personal ambition made him appear as a safe, controllable figure to the various power centers within the Egyptian government.[^24]

When Nasser died suddenly of a heart attack on September 28, 1970, Sadat became acting president.[^25] Seventeen days later, on October 15, 1970, he was elected president in a referendum.[^26] However, few expected him to last long in office. The CIA estimated he would survive no more than six months before being replaced by a "stronger" leader.[^27] Nasser's supporters and other powerful figures in government viewed Sadat as a transitional figure they could manipulate.[^28] This underestimation would prove to be a grave miscalculation.

In May 1971, Sadat demonstrated his political acumen by launching what he called the "Corrective Revolution," a purge of Nasserist rivals who had attempted to limit his authority.[^29] Vice President Ali Sabry and other influential officials who had tried to organize a coup were arrested and removed from power.[^30] This bold move consolidated Sadat's control over the state apparatus and signaled that he was no puppet but a leader in his own right.[^31] From this position of strength, he would go on to reshape Egypt's domestic and foreign policies in ways that would have been unimaginable during Nasser's era.[^32]

## Major Achievements

Sadat's presidency was marked by several transformative decisions that fundamentally altered Egypt's trajectory and the broader Middle Eastern political landscape. His most significant achievements can be organized into three major categories: military restoration of Egyptian dignity, diplomatic breakthrough with Israel, and economic restructuring.[^33]

### The October War of 1973

Perhaps no single event did more to establish Sadat's credibility and restore Egyptian national pride than the October War (also known as the Yom Kippur War).[^34] On October 6, 1973, Egyptian forces launched a coordinated surprise attack with Syria against Israeli positions in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights.[^35] The initial Egyptian assault successfully crossed the Suez Canal and breached the Bar-Lev Line, Israel's supposedly impregnable defensive fortification.[^36]

While the war's ultimate military outcome was mixed—Israel eventually counterattacked and Egyptian forces faced encirclement—the psychological and political impact was profound.[^37] For the first time since the humiliating defeat of 1967, Egyptian soldiers had fought effectively against the Israeli military, restoring a sense of honor and capability to the Egyptian armed forces and nation.[^38] This restored dignity gave Sadat the political capital and credibility to pursue peace negotiations from a position of strength rather than weakness.[^39] The war also demonstrated to both sides that military solutions alone could not resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, creating the conditions for diplomatic breakthroughs.[^40]

### The Camp David Accords and Peace with Israel

Sadat's most consequential and controversial achievement was initiating peace negotiations with Israel, culminating in the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty of 1979.[^41] In a stunning move that shocked the world, Sadat traveled to Jerusalem in November 1977 and addressed the Israeli Knesset, becoming the first Arab leader to officially visit Israel.[^42] In his historic speech, he declared: "Today I tell you, and I declare it to the whole world, that we accept to live with you in permanent peace based on justice."[^43]

This unprecedented gesture led to intensive negotiations mediated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter at the presidential retreat of Camp David in September 1978.[^44] The resulting Camp David Accords consisted of two framework agreements: one outlining a comprehensive peace settlement for the Middle East, and another specifically addressing Egyptian-Israeli relations.[^45] On March 26, 1979, Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in Washington, D.C., formally ending the state of war that had existed since 1948.[^46]

The treaty's terms included Israel's complete withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, which had been occupied since 1967, in exchange for Egyptian recognition of Israel and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations.[^47] For their efforts, Sadat and Begin were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.[^48] The agreement represented a fundamental realignment in Middle Eastern politics, removing Egypt—the largest and most powerful Arab state—from the coalition of countries in active conflict with Israel.[^49]

### Economic Liberalization (Infitah)

On the domestic front, Sadat implemented a policy of economic liberalization known as "Infitah" (Arabic for "opening").[^50] This represented a dramatic departure from Nasser's socialist economic policies, which had emphasized state control, nationalization, and Arab socialism.[^51] Sadat's Infitah encouraged private investment, reduced government economic intervention, welcomed foreign capital, and sought to integrate Egypt more fully into the global capitalist economy.[^52]

The policy attracted foreign investment and created opportunities for a new entrepreneurial class in Egypt.[^53] It also strengthened Egypt's economic ties with Western nations, particularly the United States, which became a major provider of economic and military aid.[^54] However, the policy's benefits were unevenly distributed, creating new inequalities and resentment that would contribute to opposition against Sadat's rule.[^55]

### Reorientation of Foreign Policy

Sadat fundamentally reoriented Egypt's foreign relations, pivoting from close alignment with the Soviet Union to partnership with the United States.[^56] In 1972, he expelled Soviet military advisers from Egypt, a move that stunned Moscow and opened the door for improved relations with Washington.[^57] This strategic realignment reflected his pragmatic assessment that "Russians can give you arms, but only the United States can give you a solution," referring to the need for American involvement in achieving a Middle East peace settlement.[^58]

This shift brought substantial benefits to Egypt, including billions of dollars in U.S. economic and military aid that continues to this day, making Egypt the second-largest recipient of American foreign assistance after Israel.[^59] It also positioned Egypt as a key American ally in the Middle East, a role that would have strategic implications for regional politics for decades to come.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his international acclaim and transformative achievements, Sadat's presidency was deeply controversial and attracted intense criticism from multiple quarters, both domestic and international.[^61] His policies alienated significant portions of Egyptian society and the broader Arab world, ultimately creating the conditions for his assassination.[^62]

### Betrayal of the Palestinian Cause

The most severe criticism came from Arab nationalist and Palestinian circles, who viewed Sadat's separate peace with Israel as a betrayal of Arab solidarity and the Palestinian cause.[^63] By making peace with Israel without securing a comprehensive settlement that addressed Palestinian rights and statehood, critics argued that Sadat had abandoned the Palestinians and undermined Arab unity.[^64] The Arab League responded to the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty by suspending Egypt's membership and moving its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis, marking Egypt's isolation from the Arab world.[^65]

Palestinian leaders condemned the treaty as legitimizing Israeli occupation and removing the pressure that a united Arab front had placed on Israel.[^66] The broader Arab public saw Sadat's actions as prioritizing Egyptian national interests over pan-Arab commitments, representing a fundamental break with the Nasserist ideology that had dominated regional politics.[^67] This perception of betrayal would resonate powerfully among those who would later assassinate him.[^68]

### Growing Authoritarianism

Domestically, Sadat faced criticism for increasingly authoritarian governance despite his rhetoric about democracy and liberalization.[^69] While he initially relaxed some of Nasser's more repressive policies and allowed greater political pluralism, including limited multi-party politics, he progressively cracked down on dissent as opposition to his peace policies mounted.[^70] In September 1981, just weeks before his assassination, Sadat ordered a massive crackdown that arrested over 1,500 people, including intellectuals, journalists, lawyers, Islamic activists, and Coptic Pope Shenouda III.[^71]

Critics accused him of developing a personality cult similar to Nasser's, styling himself as the "Hero of War and Peace" and the "Believer President," and demanding absolute loyalty.[^72] His intolerance for criticism and opposition, particularly regarding his peace initiatives with Israel, created an atmosphere of repression that contradicted his stated commitment to democratic values.[^73] The mass arrests of 1981 demonstrated that Sadat would not tolerate organized opposition to his policies, regardless of its source.[^74]

### Economic Inequality and Corruption

Sadat's Infitah economic policies, while creating some growth and opportunities, also generated significant inequality and corruption.[^75] The benefits of economic liberalization flowed primarily to a narrow elite with connections to the government, while many ordinary Egyptians saw little improvement in their living standards.[^76] The new wealthy class that emerged during this period, often derisively called "fat cats" or "infitah millionaires," displayed conspicuous consumption that contrasted sharply with the poverty experienced by many Egyptians.[^77]

The perception that Sadat's family and close associates were personally enriching themselves through corrupt dealings fueled popular resentment.[^78] His wife, Jehan Sadat, though admired by some for her advocacy of women's rights, was criticized by others as interfering in politics and symbolizing the privileges of the ruling elite.[^79] The widening gap between rich and poor, combined with inflation and reduced subsidies on basic goods, created economic grievances that fed opposition to Sadat's rule.[^80]

### Questionable Strategic Decisions

Military historians and strategic analysts have debated Sadat's conduct during the October War of 1973.[^81] While the initial Egyptian success restored national pride, critics argue that Sadat's subsequent decisions squandered strategic advantages.[^82] Egyptian forces' attempt to advance beyond their established positions led to heavy losses and allowed Israel to counterattack effectively, eventually crossing to the west bank of the Suez Canal and encircling the Egyptian Third Army.[^83]

Some critics contend that Sadat's political objectives in launching the war—primarily to create conditions for negotiations—led him to accept a military stalemate that a more ambitious strategy might have avoided.[^84] Others argue that the war's mixed military outcome was acceptable given the political achievements it facilitated, but questions remain about whether different military decisions could have produced better results.[^85]

## Personal Life

Anwar Sadat's personal life reflected both traditional Egyptian values and a more cosmopolitan outlook that distinguished him from many of his contemporaries in the Arab world.[^86] His family relationships, personal interests, and character traits shaped both his public image and his approach to governance.[^87]

Sadat was married twice. His first marriage was to Ekbal Madi, with whom he had three daughters before the marriage ended in divorce.[^88] In 1949, at age 31, he married Jehan Raouf, who was then only 15 years old, though such age differences were more socially acceptable in Egypt at that time.[^89] Jehan, who came from an upper-middle-class family with an Egyptian father and English mother, became one of the most visible and active First Ladies in the Arab world.[^90]

Together, Anwar and Jehan Sadat had four children: three daughters named Lubna, Noha, and Jehan (named after her mother), and one son named Gamal.[^91] Unlike many Arab First Ladies who maintained low public profiles, Jehan Sadat was notably visible and politically engaged.[^92] She pursued education, earning a bachelor's degree and later a doctorate, and actively advocated for women's rights, education, and social welfare in Egypt.[^93] She played a role in reforming personal status laws to improve women's legal rights in marriage and divorce, changes that became known as "Jehan's Laws."[^94]

Sadat's personality combined religious devotion with political pragmatism. He styled himself as the "Believer President" and frequently emphasized his Islamic faith, regularly appearing in public prayer and making religious references in his speeches.[^95] However, this religious identity did not prevent him from making pragmatic political decisions that religious conservatives opposed, including peace with Israel and granting greater rights to women and religious minorities.[^96]

Those who knew Sadat described him as a complex figure: charming and personable in private settings, but capable of ruthlessness in political matters.[^97] He enjoyed simple pleasures and maintained connections to his rural roots, often retreating to his village birthplace and emphasizing his identification with ordinary Egyptians and Africans.[^98] He was known for his distinctive pipe smoking and his preference for simpler military-style clothing over formal suits, cultivating an image that contrasted with the urban sophistication of many Egyptian elites.[^99]

Sadat authored an autobiography titled "In Search of Identity," published in 1978, which offered his perspective on his life and political philosophy.[^100] The book revealed a leader who saw himself as a man of destiny, guided by faith and conviction to transform Egypt and the Middle East.[^101] His writing reflected both introspection about his personal journey and confidence in the righteousness of his political decisions, particularly regarding peace with Israel.[^102]

## Legacy

Anwar Sadat's legacy remains deeply contested and continues to evoke sharply divided assessments more than four decades after his death.[^103] His impact on Egypt, the Middle East, and international relations is undeniable, but interpretations of whether that impact was positive or negative vary dramatically depending on perspective and values.[^104]

### Impact on Egyptian Society

Within Egypt, Sadat's legacy is mixed and has evolved over time.[^105] His peace treaty with Israel ended decades of conflict and war that had cost Egypt dearly in blood and treasure, allowing the country to redirect resources from military expenditures to economic development.[^106] The Sinai Peninsula, lost in 1967, was returned to Egyptian sovereignty, fulfilling a primary national objective.[^107] Egypt's relationship with the United States, established during Sadat's presidency, brought billions of dollars in economic and military aid that continues to flow to this day.[^108]

However, Sadat's economic liberalization policies created social divisions and inequalities whose effects persist.[^109] The erosion of Nasser's welfare state, combined with incomplete economic reforms, contributed to ongoing economic challenges including poverty, unemployment, and inequality.[^110] His encouragement of political Islam as a counterweight to leftist and Nasserist opposition had unintended consequences, strengthening Islamist movements that would later pose significant challenges to Egyptian governments.[^111]

Sadat's authoritarian governance style set precedents that his successor, Hosni Mubarak, would follow and expand upon, ruling Egypt for nearly thirty years with emergency laws and limited political freedoms.[^112] The question of whether Sadat's democratic rhetoric represented genuine commitment or merely tactical positioning remains debated.[^113]

### Regional and International Influence

In the broader Middle East, Sadat's decision to pursue separate peace with Israel fundamentally altered regional dynamics.[^114] By removing Egypt from the Arab-Israeli military equation, he made comprehensive Arab-Israeli war less likely, as no Arab coalition could credibly threaten Israel without Egypt's participation.[^115] This strategic shift arguably created space for eventual peace agreements between Israel and other Arab nations, though it took decades for Jordan to follow Egypt's example in 1994, and comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace remains elusive.[^116]

His reorientation of Egypt from Soviet to American alignment contributed to Cold War dynamics in the Middle East and established patterns of American engagement in the region that continue today.[^117] Egypt under Sadat became a cornerstone of American Middle East policy, a role that has persisted through multiple American administrations and continues to influence regional politics.[^118]

### Inspiration and Controversy

Sadat's bold personal diplomacy—epitomized by his dramatic visit to Jerusalem—demonstrated that courageous leadership could break seemingly intractable deadlocks.[^119] His willingness to take personal and political risks for peace inspired others who sought to resolve longstanding conflicts through negotiation rather than violence.[^120] The Camp David framework established precedents and mechanisms for Arab-Israeli negotiations that influenced subsequent peace processes.[^121]

Conversely, his legacy remains profoundly controversial in much of the Arab world, where many still view his actions as betrayal of Arab and Palestinian interests.[^122] The perception that he prioritized Egyptian national interests over pan-Arab solidarity contributed to the decline of pan-Arabism as a dominant political ideology, replaced by more state-centric approaches to regional politics.[^123]

### Martyrdom and Assassination

Sadat's assassination by Islamic extremists on October 6, 1981, during a military parade commemorating the October War, added a dimension of martyrdom to his legacy.[^124] He died on the anniversary of his greatest military achievement, killed by those who rejected his greatest diplomatic accomplishment.[^125] The fact that he was murdered by members of Egypt's own military during a celebration of Egyptian military prowess created powerful symbolism about the deep divisions his policies had created within Egyptian society.[^126]

For supporters, his willingness to pursue peace despite knowing the dangers demonstrated supreme courage and commitment to principle.[^127] For detractors, his death represented the inevitable consequences of policies that betrayed fundamental Arab values and interests.[^128] This divergence in interpretation ensures that Sadat's legacy will remain contested, subject to ongoing reinterpretation based on evolving political contexts and values.[^129]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and analysts who view Sadat favorably emphasize his transformative courage and strategic vision in fundamentally reshaping Middle Eastern politics.[^130] These positive assessments focus on several key themes that highlight his contributions to peace and Egyptian national interests.[^131]

Many historians credit Sadat with extraordinary personal bravery in pursuing peace with Israel despite knowing the immense risks.[^132] His dramatic gesture of traveling to Jerusalem in 1977, addressing Israel's parliament, and declaring his willingness to make peace required courage that few leaders possess.[^133] Supporters argue that this boldness demonstrated true statesmanship—the willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and take personal risks for the greater good.[^134]

From this perspective, Sadat successfully restored Egyptian national dignity through a two-stage strategy: first achieving military credibility in the October War of 1973, then translating that achievement into a diplomatic settlement that regained Egyptian territory.[^135] Unlike his predecessor Nasser, who left Egypt with occupied territory and a devastated military after 1967, Sadat returned the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egyptian sovereignty through negotiation.[^136] This accomplishment, supporters argue, demonstrated that pragmatic diplomacy could achieve what continued warfare could not.[^137]

Admirers of Sadat emphasize his prescient recognition that Egypt's national interests diverged from broader Arab nationalist ideology.[^138] By prioritizing Egyptian welfare over pan-Arab solidarity, he ended the costly burden of Egyptian leadership of the Arab world and allowed Egypt to pursue its own development.[^139] The billions of dollars in American aid that flowed to Egypt following the peace treaty represented tangible benefits that improved Egyptian military capabilities and supported economic development.[^140]

Defenders also note that Sadat's peace initiative did not completely abandon Palestinian interests, as the Camp David Accords included a framework for Palestinian autonomy, even if this element was never fully implemented.[^141] From this viewpoint, Sadat attempted to advance both Egyptian and Palestinian interests, but the failure of comprehensive peace reflected intransigence by other parties rather than his abandonment of the Palestinian cause.[^142]

Some scholars appreciate Sadat's economic reforms as necessary corrections to Nasser's failed socialist policies.[^143] While acknowledging that Infitah created inequality and corruption, these analysts argue that economic liberalization was essential for Egypt's long-term prosperity and that the problems emerged more from incomplete implementation than from the fundamental approach.[^144] They contend that Sadat's economic vision pointed Egypt in the right direction, even if execution was imperfect.[^145]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars and analysts offer sharply contrasting assessments, emphasizing Sadat's betrayal of Arab interests, authoritarian governance, and policies that benefited elites while harming ordinary Egyptians.[^146] These critiques challenge the positive narratives and highlight the costs of Sadat's decisions.[^147]

The most severe criticism focuses on Sadat's separate peace with Israel as a fundamental betrayal of Arab solidarity and Palestinian rights.[^148] Critics argue that by removing Egypt from the Arab-Israeli conflict without securing Palestinian statehood or meaningful progress toward comprehensive peace, Sadat eliminated the primary pressure point on Israel to make concessions.[^149] This separate peace, from this perspective, abandoned Palestinians to face Israeli occupation alone, without the leverage that a united Arab front had provided.[^150]

Scholars critical of Sadat emphasize that the peace treaty primarily served Israeli interests by neutralizing the strongest Arab military, while providing minimal benefits to Palestinians or other Arabs.[^151] The framework for Palestinian autonomy included in the Camp David Accords was vague and ultimately led nowhere, suggesting it served more as political cover than as genuine commitment to Palestinian rights.[^152] Egypt's isolation from the Arab world following the treaty, including suspension from the Arab League, demonstrated the depth of Arab opposition to Sadat's actions.[^153]

Critics also challenge the narrative of the October War as a military success, noting that while initial Egyptian advances restored some dignity, the war's ultimate outcome was mixed at best, with Israeli forces counterattacking and surrounding the Egyptian Third Army.[^154] The war's political achievements, they argue, came at significant cost and might have been achievable through other means.[^155] Some analysts suggest that Sadat's willingness to accept a military stalemate reflected weakness rather than strategic wisdom.[^156]

On domestic governance, critics emphasize Sadat's growing authoritarianism and intolerance for dissent.[^157] Despite rhetoric about democracy and liberalization, his presidency saw systematic suppression of opposition, culminating in the mass arrests of September 1981 that imprisoned over 1,500 people from across the political spectrum.[^158] This repression, combined with emergency laws and restrictions on political activity, created authoritarian patterns that his successor Hosni Mubarak would expand and maintain for three decades.[^159]

Sadat's economic policies receive harsh criticism for creating inequality, corruption, and dependency on foreign powers.[^160] The Infitah system benefited a narrow elite with government connections while leaving most Egyptians to face inflation, reduced subsidies, and declining public services.[^161] The corruption that flourished under economic liberalization, combined with conspicuous consumption by the new wealthy class, created social resentment and undermined faith in government.[^162]

Finally, critical scholars note that Sadat's encouragement of Islamist movements as a counterweight to leftist and Nasserist opposition had disastrous long-term consequences.[^163] By releasing Islamist prisoners and allowing Islamic organizations greater freedom, he strengthened movements that ultimately turned against him and posed ongoing challenges to Egyptian stability.[^164] His assassination by Islamic Jihad represented not just personal tragedy but the logical outcome of policies that empowered religious extremists.[^165]
