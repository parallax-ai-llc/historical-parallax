## Summary

Ebrahim Raisi (also known as Ibrahim Raisi) served as the eighth President of Iran from August 2021 until his death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. A hardline conservative cleric and jurist, Raisi rose through Iran's judicial system to become Chief Justice before winning the presidency in an election marked by historically low turnout and widespread disqualifications of rival candidates. His tenure was defined by mass protests following the death of Mahsa Amini, severe economic challenges under international sanctions, and closer ties with Russia and China. Raisi remains one of Iran's most controversial figures, accused by human rights organizations of involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 while simultaneously praised by supporters as a defender of Islamic revolutionary values.

## Early Life and Background

Ebrahim Raisi was born on December 14, 1960, in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city and a major center of Shia Islamic scholarship. He was born into a religious family in the Noghan district of Mashhad, and his father, a cleric, died when Raisi was only five years old, leaving the family in difficult financial circumstances. This early loss profoundly shaped his upbringing, as he was raised primarily by his mother in modest conditions.[^1]

From a young age, Raisi was immersed in religious education, studying at the Mashhad seminary. At the age of 15, he was sent to the holy city of Qom to continue his religious studies at its prestigious seminaries, which have historically served as the intellectual heart of Shia Islam in Iran. In Qom, Raisi studied under influential clerics and received training in Islamic jurisprudence and philosophy. Unlike many of Iran's senior clerics who spent decades in scholarly pursuit before entering public life, Raisi's seminary education was relatively brief and he never achieved the highest ranks of Shia religious scholarship.[^2]

The Islamic Revolution of 1979, which overthrew the Pahlavi monarchy and established the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, occurred when Raisi was just 18 years old. Like many young seminary students of his generation, Raisi was swept up in the revolutionary fervor and became an enthusiastic supporter of Khomeini's vision for an Islamic state. The revolution would provide unprecedented opportunities for young clerics like Raisi to assume positions of power in the newly established theocratic system.[^3]

---

## Rise to Power

Raisi's rapid ascent through Iran's power structure began almost immediately after the revolution. In 1980, at the remarkably young age of 20, he was appointed prosecutor of Karaj, a major city near Tehran. This appointment came despite his youth and limited legal training, reflecting both the revolutionary government's need for loyalist personnel and Raisi's connections to powerful clerics. The following year, he was promoted to prosecutor of Hamadan province, continuing his meteoric rise.[^4]

In 1985, at age 25, Raisi was appointed prosecutor of Tehran, one of the most powerful judicial positions in the country. This role placed him at the center of the Islamic Republic's efforts to consolidate power and eliminate opposition. It was during this period that Raisi became associated with what would become the most controversial episode of his career: the 1988 mass execution of political prisoners.[^5]

In the summer of 1988, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa ordering the execution of political prisoners, primarily members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) and leftist groups. Raisi served on the "death commission" in Tehran, a four-person panel that conducted brief trials and sent thousands to their deaths. Estimates of those executed range from 2,800 to 5,000, though exact numbers remain disputed. This event would haunt Raisi's career, with human rights organizations and opposition groups consistently raising it as evidence of his involvement in crimes against humanity.[^6]

Following this dark chapter, Raisi continued to advance through the judicial hierarchy. He served in various prosecutorial and judicial roles throughout the 1990s and 2000s, building a reputation as a hardline enforcer of Islamic law and revolutionary principles. In 2004, he was appointed First Deputy Chief Justice of Iran, and in 2014, he became Prosecutor General, positions that gave him significant influence over the country's legal system.[^7]

In 2016, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed Raisi as custodian of Astan Quds Razavi, the wealthy charitable foundation that manages the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad. This position not only provided Raisi with substantial financial resources and a powerful platform but also signaled Khamenei's favor. The foundation controls vast assets including agricultural land, real estate, and industrial enterprises, with an estimated value in the billions of dollars.[^8]

## Major Achievements

Raisi's supporters point to several accomplishments during his presidency and judicial career, though these remain contested by his critics. Upon assuming the presidency in August 2021, Raisi inherited an economy devastated by U.S. sanctions, which had been reimposed after President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. His administration focused on what it called a "resistance economy," emphasizing self-sufficiency and reduced dependence on the West.[^9]

Under Raisi's leadership, Iran significantly strengthened its relationships with Russia and China, positioning itself within what some analysts call an emerging anti-Western bloc. Iran provided Russia with military drones for use in its war against Ukraine, deepening military cooperation between Tehran and Moscow. Trade with China expanded substantially, with Beijing becoming Iran's largest trading partner and providing a crucial economic lifeline amid Western sanctions.[^10]

In March 2023, Raisi's government achieved a diplomatic breakthrough when China brokered a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, regional rivals who had severed diplomatic relations in 2016. The agreement to restore diplomatic ties was hailed by supporters as a major foreign policy achievement that reduced regional tensions and demonstrated Iran's successful pivot toward Asia.[^11]

On the domestic front, Raisi's government implemented various infrastructure projects, particularly in water management and transportation. His administration claimed progress in connecting remote villages to electricity and water networks, though independent verification of these achievements remains limited. The government also emphasized agricultural development and food security as strategic priorities.[^12]

Raisi's supporters within Iran's conservative establishment praised his unwavering commitment to Islamic revolutionary principles and his resistance to Western pressure. They viewed him as a steadfast defender of the Islamic Republic's values who refused to compromise Iran's sovereignty in nuclear negotiations. His judicial background was portrayed as evidence of his commitment to Islamic law and justice as understood within the revolutionary framework.[^13]

As Chief Justice from 2019 to 2021, Raisi oversaw judicial reforms that his supporters claimed improved efficiency and reduced case backlogs. He implemented digitalization initiatives in the court system and claimed to prioritize fighting corruption, though critics argued these efforts selectively targeted political opponents while protecting regime insiders.[^14]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The 1988 mass executions remained the most serious allegation against Raisi throughout his career. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, consistently documented his role on the "death commission" and called for his investigation for crimes against humanity. Survivors and families of victims campaigned internationally for accountability, describing the executions as a systematic massacre of political opponents.[^15]

When Raisi ran for president in 2017 (losing to Hassan Rouhani) and again successfully in 2021, the families of 1988 victims protested his candidacy. An audio recording of Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, once Khomeini's designated successor, emerged in which he condemned the executions and criticized those involved, including Raisi. Despite these revelations, Iranian authorities never investigated Raisi's role, and he consistently refused to address questions about the executions.[^16]

Raisi's presidency coincided with some of the most severe protests in the Islamic Republic's history. In September 2022, Mahsa (Zhina) Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Her death sparked nationwide protests under the slogan "Woman, Life, Freedom," with demonstrators calling for an end to the Islamic Republic itself.[^17]

The government's response was brutal, with security forces killing over 500 protesters according to human rights organizations, including more than 70 children. Thousands were arrested, and the judiciary handed down death sentences to protesters in what rights groups called sham trials. The crackdown on the protest movement became one of the defining features of Raisi's presidency, drawing international condemnation and additional sanctions.[^18]

Economic conditions deteriorated significantly during Raisi's tenure. Despite promises to improve living standards, ordinary Iranians faced soaring inflation, which reached over 40% in 2022-2023. The Iranian rial hit record lows against the dollar, and poverty rates increased. While sanctions played a major role, critics also blamed government mismanagement, corruption, and the prioritization of ideological commitments over economic pragmatism.[^19]

The 2021 presidential election that brought Raisi to power was marked by historically low turnout of approximately 49%, the lowest since the 1979 revolution. The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, disqualified all serious reformist and moderate candidates, leaving Raisi facing only weak, regime-approved opponents. Many Iranians viewed the election as predetermined, with critics calling it a "selection" rather than an election.[^20]

Under Raisi, Iran's nuclear program advanced significantly, with uranium enrichment reaching 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels. While supporters framed this as strengthening Iran's negotiating position, critics warned it brought Iran closer to nuclear weapons capability and increased the risk of military confrontation with Israel and potentially the United States.[^21]

Press freedom and civil liberties deteriorated further during Raisi's presidency. Journalists, activists, and dual nationals were arrested on security charges. Internet restrictions intensified, particularly during protests, with authorities throttling or shutting down internet access. Iran's ranking in press freedom indices fell to among the world's worst.[^22]

## Personal Life

Ebrahim Raisi married Jamileh Alamolhoda in the early 1980s, forming a union that aligned two religious families deeply committed to the Islamic Republic. Jamileh is the daughter of Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, the Friday prayer leader of Mashhad and a prominent hardline cleric with close ties to Supreme Leader Khamenei. This marriage strengthened Raisi's connections within Iran's conservative religious establishment.[^23]

The couple had two daughters, both of whom married into influential clerical and political families, further cementing the Raisi family's position within Iran's ruling elite. Raisi's daughters largely stayed out of the public eye, consistent with the family's conservative values and the general practice among Iran's clerical establishment.[^24]

Jamileh Alamolhoda took on a public role as First Lady, though her approach differed from some of her predecessors. She advocated for strict Islamic dress codes for women and defended the mandatory hijab, positions that brought her criticism during the Woman, Life, Freedom protests. She made public appearances promoting charitable activities and traditional family values aligned with the regime's ideology.[^25]

Raisi was described by those who knew him as soft-spoken and reserved in personal interactions, though uncompromising in his ideological commitments. He maintained a relatively modest public lifestyle compared to some Iranian officials, which his supporters portrayed as evidence of his piety and dedication to service rather than personal enrichment. However, critics noted his position overseeing the wealthy Astan Quds Razavi foundation provided access to substantial resources.[^26]

A devout Shia Muslim, Raisi regularly participated in religious ceremonies and maintained close relationships with senior clerics in Qom and Mashhad. He wore the black turban signifying descent from the Prophet Muhammad, a status that carries religious significance in Shia Islam. His religiosity appeared genuine to observers, and he frequently referenced Islamic principles in his speeches and decisions.[^27]

Raisi spoke Persian as his native language and had functional knowledge of Arabic, essential for Islamic scholarship. Unlike some Iranian leaders who studied in the West, Raisi's entire educational and professional formation occurred within Iran's religious and revolutionary institutions, shaping his worldview and priorities.[^28]

## Legacy

Ebrahim Raisi's sudden death in a helicopter crash on May 19, 2024, while traveling in northwestern Iran, shocked the country and immediately raised questions about his legacy and Iran's political future. The crash, which also killed Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials, occurred in mountainous terrain amid poor weather conditions. While Iranian authorities attributed the crash to technical and weather-related factors, the circumstances sparked international speculation.[^29]

Raisi's legacy remains deeply contested and will likely be debated for generations. For supporters within Iran's conservative establishment, he represented unwavering commitment to the Islamic Revolution's principles and resistance to Western pressure. State media and conservative outlets portrayed him as a martyr who dedicated his life to defending Iran's sovereignty and Islamic values against foreign enemies. His funeral drew large crowds in cities like Tehran, Qom, and Mashhad, though the extent to which attendance was organic versus organized remains disputed.[^30]

The Islamic Republic lost a figure who had been widely viewed as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Khamenei, who was in his mid-80s at the time of Raisi's death. Raisi's position, his close relationship with Khamenei, and his hardline credentials had made him a leading candidate for the succession. His death left the succession question more uncertain and potentially complicated the regime's plans for a smooth transition of power.[^31]

For human rights advocates, opposition groups, and families of victims, Raisi's death without ever being held accountable for the 1988 executions represented a profound injustice. Many viewed him as having evaded justice for crimes against humanity, and his elevation to the presidency despite this record symbolized the impunity enjoyed by regime officials. International human rights organizations continued to call for investigation and accountability even after his death.[^32]

Economically, Raisi's presidency failed to deliver on promises of improved living standards for ordinary Iranians. His "resistance economy" approach did not alleviate the suffering caused by sanctions and mismanagement. The economic hardships and inequality that persisted and worsened during his tenure contributed to the protest movements that defined his presidency, leaving a legacy of unmet expectations.[^33]

The Woman, Life, Freedom movement and the government's brutal crackdown will likely be central to how Raisi's presidency is remembered internationally. The images of protesters, particularly young women removing their headscarves in defiance, and the state's violent response became defining symbols of his tenure. This aspect of his legacy severely damaged Iran's international reputation and deepened the divide between the regime and significant segments of Iranian society, particularly youth and women.[^34]

Raisi's foreign policy legacy is mixed. While the rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and strengthened ties with Russia and China could be viewed as achievements in diversifying Iran's international relationships, Iran remained deeply isolated from the West and subject to crippling sanctions. The advancement of the nuclear program without diplomatic breakthrough left Iran in a dangerous standoff with potential for future conflict.[^35]

Within Iran, Raisi's legacy varies dramatically across different social groups. While conservative and religious constituencies, particularly in cities like Mashhad and Qom, mourned him as a defender of their values, urban middle classes, youth, ethnic minorities, and reform-minded Iranians viewed him as a symbol of repression and failed governance. This polarization reflects the broader divisions within Iranian society that intensified during his presidency.[^36]

Historians will likely assess Raisi as a product and enforcer of the Islamic Republic's most hardline elements, whose career embodied the revolutionary regime's authoritarian character. His rise from the 1988 death commissions to the presidency illustrated the system's prioritization of loyalty and ideological commitment over accountability, reform, or popular legitimacy.[^37]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Raisi, primarily within Iran's conservative establishment and among ideologically committed segments of the population, present several arguments in his favor. They emphasize his steadfast commitment to the principles of the Islamic Revolution and his refusal to compromise Iran's sovereignty in the face of Western pressure. In this view, Raisi represented authentic adherence to the vision of Ayatollah Khomeini and resistance to foreign domination.[^38]

Conservative Iranian media and officials praised Raisi's efforts to maintain Iran's independence in foreign policy, particularly his resistance to what they characterized as unfair demands in nuclear negotiations. They argued that his administration's pivot toward Russia and China demonstrated strategic wisdom in developing alternatives to Western-dominated international structures. The China-brokered détente with Saudi Arabia was portrayed as evidence of successful diplomacy that enhanced regional stability.[^39]

Religious supporters highlighted Raisi's personal piety and commitment to Islamic governance. They viewed his judicial background and religious credentials as qualifications for leadership in an Islamic Republic, arguing that he worked to implement Sharia law and defend Islamic values against secular and Western influences. His management of the Astan Quds Razavi foundation was cited as evidence of his administrative capabilities and dedication to serving religious institutions.[^40]

Some defenders argued that criticism of Raisi regarding the 1988 executions ignored the context of that period, including the MEK's armed insurgency and the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War. They claimed that the executed prisoners were not peaceful dissidents but members of armed groups responsible for terrorist attacks and treason. While acknowledging the events' severity, they argued that Raisi was a junior official following orders in the context of defending the state.[^41]

Economic supporters pointed to infrastructure development projects and efforts to strengthen domestic production under the "resistance economy" model. They argued that any economic difficulties stemmed primarily from unjust U.S. sanctions rather than policy failures, and that Raisi's administration worked to mitigate sanctions' impact through self-sufficiency and trade diversification. The expansion of relations with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS nations was portrayed as opening new opportunities.[^42]

Some Iranian analysts who supported the system but acknowledged its flaws argued that Raisi represented stability and predictability in a volatile region. They suggested that his conservative credentials allowed him to pursue some pragmatic policies, such as the Saudi rapprochement, without facing accusations of betraying revolutionary principles that might have hampered a reformist leader attempting similar initiatives.[^43]

### Negative Views

Critics and opponents of Raisi present a fundamentally different assessment, viewing him as a symbol of the Islamic Republic's worst authoritarian tendencies and human rights abuses. The 1988 mass executions remain the centerpiece of negative assessments, with human rights organizations consistently documenting his role and calling for accountability. Organizations like Amnesty International described the executions as crimes against humanity and condemned Raisi's impunity as evidence of the regime's disregard for justice.[^44]

International human rights advocates pointed to the pattern throughout Raisi's career: his involvement in the 1988 massacres, his role in suppressing dissent as a prosecutor and judge, and the brutal crackdown on protests during his presidency. They argued this record demonstrated a consistent willingness to use violence to maintain power, making him responsible for the suffering of thousands of Iranian families over decades.[^45]

Iranian opposition groups and exiles viewed Raisi as the embodiment of the regime's failure and illegitimacy. They argued that his rigged election with historically low turnout demonstrated the system's inability to maintain popular support. His presidency, in this view, represented the hardliners' complete consolidation of power and the end of any pretense of democratic accountability within the Islamic Republic's structure.[^46]

Feminist scholars and women's rights activists pointed to the intensification of gender-based repression during Raisi's tenure. The death of Mahsa Amini and the violent suppression of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement symbolized the regime's determination to enforce its patriarchal ideology through violence. Raisi's wife's defense of mandatory hijab and his government's crackdown on women's rights protesters were cited as evidence of his administration's misogyny.[^47]

Economic critics highlighted the deterioration of living standards under Raisi's presidency despite his campaign promises. They documented increasing poverty, unemployment, and inflation, arguing that ideological rigidity and corruption prevented effective economic management. The benefits of increased trade with Russia and China, they argued, largely accrued to regime-connected elites while ordinary Iranians suffered.[^48]

Regional analysts criticized Raisi's foreign policy as deepening Iran's international isolation and increasing the risk of military conflict. His government's advancement of uranium enrichment, support for regional proxy groups, and provision of drones to Russia for use against Ukraine were cited as destabilizing actions that made Iran a pariah state and increased the likelihood of confrontation with Israel and potentially the United States.[^49]

Some Iranian intellectuals and former officials who had initially supported the revolution but became disillusioned viewed Raisi's presidency as representing the revolution's betrayal of its original promises. They argued that the ideals of justice and independence that motivated the revolution had been corrupted into a system of repression and economic mismanagement personified by leaders like Raisi.[^50]

International legal experts emphasized that Raisi's death should not end efforts to document and seek accountability for the 1988 executions and other human rights violations. They argued for continued investigation, documentation, and truth-seeking as essential for historical justice and for the Iranian people's right to know the full truth about their history.[^51]
