## Summary

Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit invented the mercury-in-glass thermometer in 1714 and developed the Fahrenheit temperature scale, still used in the United States and a few other countries. He was the first to show that the boiling point of liquids changes with atmospheric pressure. His precise thermometers enabled accurate temperature measurement for science and medicine.
