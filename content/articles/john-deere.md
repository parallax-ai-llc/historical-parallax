## Summary

John Deere invented the first commercially successful steel plow, which transformed American agriculture. His self-scouring plow solved the problem of heavy Midwestern soil sticking to cast-iron plows. He founded Deere & Company, which grew into the world's largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment. The John Deere brand remains one of the most recognized in farming worldwide.
