## Summary

Hong Gyeong-rae (1780–1812) was a Korean rebel leader who led one of the most significant peasant uprisings in Joseon Dynasty history. Born in Yonggang County, Pyeongan Province, to the Namyang Hong clan, he organized a massive rebellion from 1811 to 1812 against regional discrimination, oppressive taxation, and economic exploitation.[^1][^2] His uprising, though ultimately unsuccessful, occupied most of the territory north of the Cheongcheon River and held the fortress city of Jeongju for over three months against government forces.[^3] Hong's rebellion became a symbol of resistance against injustice and inspired future reform movements in Korea.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Hong Gyeong-rae was born in 1780 in Damidong, Yonggang County, located in Pyeongan Province in northwestern Korea.[^5][^6] He came from the Namyang Hong clan, a respectable lineage, and was the third of four siblings born to his father Hong and mother from the Yu family.[^7] Historical records indicate that the names of his ancestors and the clans of his grandmothers remain unknown, suggesting his family may have been of modest standing despite their yangban connections.[^8]

The question of Hong's social status has been debated by historians. Some accounts describe him as a fallen yangban (the social and political elite of Joseon society), while more reliable evidence suggests he was an educated commoner, possibly a member of the provincial military class.[^9][^10] This ambiguity may have stemmed from fictionalized accounts of his life based on Chinese novels translated into Korean.[^11] What is certain is that Hong received a solid education, becoming well-versed in Confucian teachings, military strategy, various divination texts, and prophetic studies.[^12]

Despite his education and intellectual capabilities, Hong lived in poverty.[^13] After learning from his maternal uncle Yu Hak-kwon and passing the Pyongyang Hyangsi (local examination), he attempted the Sima examination in 1798 to become a civil servant but failed.[^14] This failure proved pivotal in his life trajectory. Abandoning his aspirations for government service, Hong became a professional geomancer (feng shui practitioner), traveling extensively throughout the region.[^15] His knowledge of geomancy and prophetic texts would later play a crucial role in his ability to recruit followers and plan his rebellion.

Hong was described by contemporaries as physically powerful and a master of martial arts, qualities that would serve him well as a military commander.[^16] His education allowed him to move between different social classes, gaining insights into both the grievances of common people and the political dynamics of the yangban class. This unique position, combined with his charisma and organizational abilities, positioned him to become one of the most significant rebel leaders in late Joseon history.

## Rise to Power

Hong Gyeong-rae's path to rebellion began in 1801 when he first met Wu Kun-cheok (U Kun-chok) at the Blue Dragon Temple, where both had studied.[^17] Wu, like Hong, was a professional geomancer who used his knowledge of secret prophecies to recruit sympathizers to the rebel cause.[^18] During their meeting, they discussed the possibility of rallying supporters for a rebellion against the Joseon government, planting seeds that would take a decade to fully germinate.[^19]

The planning for Hong's rebellion was unprecedented in its scope and duration. Since 1801, Hong methodically made plans for an organized revolt, demonstrating remarkable patience and strategic thinking.[^20] This rebellion was immense in scale compared to past revolts, as it was a coordinated action that went under planning for ten years.[^21] By December 1810, material preparations intensified when Hong and Wu Kun-cheok met again to finalize their plans.[^22]

Hong's recruitment strategy was sophisticated and multi-faceted. He leveraged prophetic ideology, particularly the Jeonggamnok, a compilation of prophetic works that foretold the downfall of the Joseon (Yi) dynasty and the establishment of a new, nearly utopian dynasty by a messianic "True Man" with the surname Jeong (Chŏng).[^23][^24] The prophecy claimed this True Man would lead an army from a sea island to bring about change, and remarkably, even predicted the year 1812 as the time of transformation.[^25] To fulfill this prophecy, Hong recruited a man named Jeong Chem-in (Chŏng Chemin) to serve as the figurehead leader of the rebellion.[^26]

By September 1811, Hong had gathered his forces on the island of Chudo and successfully earned support from wealthy landowners, demonstrating his ability to appeal across class boundaries.[^27] His rebellion attracted participants from every caste of society, including peasants, miners, handicraft artisans, merchants, and temporary laborers.[^28] This broad coalition reflected the widespread discontent with Joseon rule in Pyeongan Province.

Hong also recruited educated yangban who brought legitimacy and administrative skills to the movement. Kim Chan-si, a yangban who had passed the lower-level civil service exam and was popular among the local yangban, joined the rebels and composed their manifesto in literary Chinese.[^29][^30] Government reports indicated Kim was in debt, which may have motivated his participation.[^31] Another key supporter was Lee Hee-jeo, who provided crucial funding and resources for the uprising.[^32]

The rebellion officially began on December 18, 1811 (January 31, 1812 in the solar calendar), when Hong launched his forces from Dabok-dong, Kasan-gun.[^33][^34] In a stunning demonstration of military prowess, Hong Gyeongnae captured most of the Gwanseo Region (the area west of the mountains in Pyeongan Province) in just ten days.[^35] His forces of approximately 1,000 rebels rapidly occupied nine towns north of the Chongchon River.[^36] This lightning-fast conquest shocked the Joseon government and established Hong as a formidable military leader.

## Major Achievements

Hong Gyeong-rae's rebellion represented a watershed moment in Korean history, achieving several significant accomplishments despite its ultimate failure. His most immediate achievement was the rapid military conquest of northwestern Pyeongan Province. Within the first ten days of the uprising, his forces captured most of the Gwanseo Region, demonstrating exceptional organizational and tactical capabilities.[^37] This swift success was unprecedented for a peasant rebellion and reflected the years of meticulous planning Hong had invested.

The rebellion's ideological achievement was equally significant. Hong successfully articulated the long-standing grievances of the Pyeongan Province population through a powerful manifesto. The document, composed by Kim Chan-si, began with the powerful statement: "The central government abandoned (Pyeongan) Province as one abandons rotten earth. Even when the slaves of powerful families saw men from (Pyeongan) Province, they always called them 'the common rabble from (Pyeongan). How unfair and what a source of resentment this is for the people of (Pyeongan) Province!"[^38] This manifesto gave voice to decades of regional discrimination and became a rallying cry for the oppressed.

Hong demonstrated exceptional military leadership throughout the campaign. He personally directed preparations for the war and commanded rebel forces in battle, displaying the martial arts mastery and physical power for which he was renowned.[^39] On January 31, 1812, Hong Chong-gak, commanding a force of 30 to 40 cavalrymen and about 150 foot soldiers under Hong's overall command, led the successful attack on Kason.[^40] The rebels captured and executed a hated provincial official, then distributed the stockpiled harvest grains to the famine-stricken population.[^41] This act of redistributive justice won popular support and demonstrated that the rebellion had concrete social objectives beyond mere violence.

The rebels' seizure of Jeongju fortress represented a major strategic accomplishment. Hong chose Jeongju Castle as the location for a defensive stand because it was sturdy with a large stockpile of food, making it an impregnable fortress perfect for staging a prolonged defense.[^42] The rebels successfully held this fortress from February 15, 1812, when government forces arrived to besiege it, until May 29, 1812—over three months of determined resistance.[^43][^44]

During the siege, Hong displayed exemplary Confucian behavior when he ordered a proper burial for an illustrious government official who had been killed by the rebels.[^45] This official was regarded as "righteous" for maintaining his loyalty to the existing dynasty, and Hong's respectful treatment of his body demonstrated that the rebel leader adhered to traditional values even in rebellion. This act contrasted sharply with government propaganda portraying the rebels as mere bandits.

Hong also demonstrated psychological warfare skills. He attempted to bolster rebel morale during the siege by claiming that Ming dynasty troops were secretly stationed in the area and would join the rebels once the rebellion began.[^46] Later, during the final days of the siege, he tried to lift spirits by claiming Qing troops were on their way to break the siege, declaring they would arrive on May 29.[^47] While these claims were false, they reveal Hong's understanding of the importance of hope and external validation in sustaining a resistance movement.

Perhaps Hong's greatest achievement was creating a truly cross-class coalition. His rebellion saw participation from members from every caste—from impoverished peasants to indebted yangban scholars, from miners to merchants.[^48] This unprecedented unity across social boundaries demonstrated Hong's charismatic leadership and the depth of discontent with Joseon rule in the northwest region. The rebellion became the first significant peasant uprising of a massive scale in Joseon history.[^49]

The rebellion also achieved lasting cultural and political impact. It sustained huge damage to the authority of the Joseon government that was dominated by royal in-laws.[^50] Even in defeat, Hong's uprising inspired future reform movements and provided momentum for other popular armed uprisings seeking a more just society in different parts of Korea.[^51] The rebellion weakened the Joseon government's legitimacy, ultimately contributing to later movements such as the Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite the sympathetic view of Hong Gyeong-rae held by many modern historians, his rebellion was marked by significant controversies and generated substantial criticism, both from contemporaries and later scholars. The Joseon government naturally portrayed Hong as a traitor and criminal. Early commercial novels like Sinmirok defined him as a "traitor," reflecting the official state position.[^53] Government documents negatively portrayed Hong, framing him as a dangerous rebel who threatened social order and legitimate authority.[^54]

One major criticism concerns the human cost of the rebellion. The uprising resulted in substantial casualties on both sides. In one battle on March 22, 1812, government forces captured 87 rebels and beheaded 69, while suffering only 17 dead and 23 wounded themselves.[^55] When Jeongju fortress finally fell, the government's reprisal was brutal: all male rebels above the age of ten were executed.[^56] Thousands of people caught up in the uprising, including boys as young as 10, were killed.[^57] While Hong cannot be held solely responsible for the government's brutal response, critics argue that he should have anticipated such reprisals and considered whether the rebellion's objectives justified such bloodshed.

Hong's strategic decisions also drew criticism. While he wisely chose Jeongju Castle for its defensive strength and food stockpiles, he failed to recognize the danger posed by government forces' tunneling efforts.[^58] Government forces ultimately breached the fortress wall using eleven tons of gunpowder explosives placed through underground tunnels.[^59] A more experienced military commander might have anticipated this tactic and taken countermeasures. This strategic oversight directly led to the rebellion's final defeat and the death or execution of hundreds of defenders.

The use of prophetic ideology and deception has also been criticized. Scholar Anders Karlsson offered counterarguments to positive assessments of the rebellion, noting that the manifesto written in classical Chinese would have been incomprehensible to the predominantly uneducated rebel army.[^60] This suggests that the manifesto's primary purpose was not to communicate with common soldiers but to legitimize the rebellion and seek support from educated elites. Karlsson emphasized how Hong manipulated prophetic works and religious ideology to recruit followers, raising questions about whether these beliefs were genuinely held or cynically exploited.[^61]

Hong's false claims about external military support represent another controversial aspect of his leadership. His statements that Ming dynasty troops were secretly stationed in the area and would join the rebels, and later claims that Qing troops would break the siege, were demonstrable falsehoods.[^62][^63] While these claims might be defended as necessary morale-boosting measures during desperate times, they also represent a willingness to deceive his own followers. When the promised reinforcements never materialized, it likely damaged morale and contributed to the final collapse of resistance.

The aftermath of the rebellion brought severe consequences for the Pyeongan Province population. Government reprisals included harsh oppression of peasants and a temporary strengthening of military presence in affected regions.[^64] Some critics argue that the rebellion, despite its noble intentions, ultimately worsened conditions for the very people it sought to help. The social discontent deepened, but without the organizational structure Hong had provided, subsequent uprisings were smaller and less coordinated.[^65]

Kim Chan-si's fate illustrates the internal tensions and betrayals that plagued the rebellion. While on a mission to recruit help from sympathizers along the border region near the Amnok River, Kim was beheaded as he slept by a traitor who sold his head to another person attempting to get a reward from the government.[^66] This betrayal suggests that Hong's coalition, while impressive in its breadth, may have lacked the deep loyalty necessary for sustained resistance. Critics point to this as evidence of inadequate security measures and insufficient vetting of rebel sympathizers.

The limited scope of government reforms following the rebellion has led some historians to question its overall impact. While the government concluded that the main causes were corrupt officials and excessive taxation during the famine, and enacted some relief measures including cancellation of taxes until a good harvest, forgiveness of loans, and holding a provincial civil service examination, no fundamental reforms were made to the taxation system.[^67][^68] Revolts continued even after 1864, suggesting that Hong's rebellion failed to achieve lasting structural change.[^69]

## Personal Life

Historical records provide limited information about Hong Gyeong-rae's personal life, as sources primarily focus on his role as a rebel leader rather than his private affairs. What is known reveals a man of complexity, caught between social classes and driven by both personal grievances and broader social concerns.

Hong's family background has already been noted—he was the third of four siblings born to his father Hong and mother from the Yu family in Yonggang County.[^70] Regarding his immediate family, Hong had at least one son with his wife, though some sources suggest he may have had two sons.[^71][^72] Unfortunately, historical records do not provide the name of his wife or detailed information about his children. This absence reflects the tendency of Joseon-era historical records to focus on male public figures while largely ignoring women and family relationships unless they had direct political relevance.

Hong's educational background significantly shaped his personality and worldview. He studied under his maternal uncle Yu Hak-kwon, suggesting a close relationship with his mother's family.[^73] His education encompassed Confucian teachings, military strategy, various divination texts, and especially prophetic studies.[^74] This broad intellectual foundation indicates a curious and ambitious mind, someone who sought knowledge from multiple sources rather than limiting himself to orthodox Confucian learning alone.

The failure of the Sima examination in 1798 appears to have been a pivotal personal crisis that redirected Hong's life trajectory.[^75] For an educated man with yangban aspirations or connections, failing the civil service examinations represented not merely a career setback but a social humiliation and the closing of the primary avenue for advancement in Joseon society. This personal disappointment likely contributed to Hong's later willingness to challenge the established order.

Hong's career as a professional geomancer reveals aspects of his personality and values. Geomancy required extensive travel throughout the region, bringing Hong into contact with people from all social classes and giving him intimate knowledge of local conditions and grievances.[^76] This profession also required a certain charisma and ability to gain people's trust, as clients needed confidence in a geomancer's advice regarding the placement of homes and ancestral tombs. These interpersonal skills would later prove invaluable in organizing the rebellion.

Hong's physical characteristics and abilities played a significant role in his life. He was described as physically powerful and a master of martial arts, attributes that would have commanded respect in Joseon society, where physical prowess was valued alongside scholarly achievement.[^77] These qualities also enabled him to personally command troops in battle and likely contributed to his followers' confidence in his leadership.

Hong's character displayed an interesting combination of revolutionary zeal and traditional Confucian values. His order for a proper burial for a government official killed by rebels, despite that official's loyalty to the dynasty Hong opposed, demonstrates respect for Confucian principles of ritual propriety and recognition of personal virtue regardless of political allegiance.[^78] This suggests Hong was not simply an angry revolutionary but someone who maintained ethical standards even in rebellion.

The decade-long planning period for the rebellion (1801-1811) reveals extraordinary patience and determination.[^79] This extended preparation required Hong to maintain secrecy, continually recruit supporters, and sustain his own commitment despite the risks involved. Such sustained focus suggests a personality driven by deep conviction rather than impulsive anger.

Hong's relationships with fellow rebel leaders like Wu Kun-cheok and Kim Chan-si indicate his ability to work collaboratively with others and recognize the value of different skills and social positions.[^80][^81] His willingness to make Jeong Chem-in the figurehead leader to fulfill prophecy, rather than claiming that position himself, suggests either tactical cleverness or genuine belief in the prophetic texts—or both.[^82]

## Legacy

Hong Gyeong-rae's legacy extends far beyond the immediate military outcome of his failed rebellion, occupying a complex and evolving place in Korean historical memory and continuing to influence Korean historical consciousness into the present day.

The rebellion's most immediate legacy was its impact on the Joseon government's authority and legitimacy. The uprising sustained huge damage to the authority of the Joseon government that was dominated by royal in-laws, exposing the regime's vulnerability to organized popular resistance.[^83] Even though the rebellion was ultimately suppressed, the very fact that a relatively small force could capture and hold significant territory for months revealed the weakness of central government control over peripheral regions.

In the immediate aftermath, the Joseon government was forced to acknowledge, at least partially, the grievances that had sparked the uprising. Officials concluded that the main causes of the rebellion were corrupt officials and excessive taxation during the famine.[^84] This official recognition represented a rare admission of government failure. The government enacted relief measures for Pyeongan Province, including cancellation of taxes until there was a good harvest, forgiveness of loans, and holding a provincial civil service examination to facilitate the advancement of local scholars.[^85] However, these reforms proved limited and temporary, with no fundamental reforms made to the taxation system that had contributed to the rebellion.[^86]

Hong's rebellion provided crucial momentum for other popular armed uprisings seeking a more just society in different parts of Korea.[^87] The social discontent that Hong had articulated and organized continued to ignite small and large peasant uprisings across the nation throughout the 19th century.[^88] The rebellion demonstrated that organized resistance was possible and that the Joseon state could be militarily challenged. This legacy of resistance ultimately contributed to the Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894, which represented an even larger challenge to the established order.[^89]

The cultural and symbolic legacy of Hong Gyeong-rae has evolved significantly over time, reflecting changing political contexts and ideological frameworks in Korea. Early commercial novels like Sinmirok defined him as a "traitor," reflecting the Joseon government's official position.[^90] However, during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), Korean intellectuals reinterpreted Hong as a "hero or revolutionary," recasting his anti-government rebellion as an early example of Korean nationalist resistance.[^91] This reinterpretation served the political purpose of constructing a historical narrative of Korean resistance to oppression, which could be applied to contemporary resistance against Japanese colonial rule.

Contemporary writers after Korea's liberation from Japanese rule in 1945 attempted to restore the multifaceted nature of Hong and the rebellion through complex narrative structures.[^92] This evolution demonstrates how a single historical figure is continually reinvented within different political and cultural contexts, illuminating both the constructed nature of historical writing and literature's function in interpreting history.[^93]

Hong Gyeong-rae's story has been adapted into popular media, ensuring his legacy reaches contemporary Korean audiences. He was portrayed by Park Chan-hwan in the 2001 MBC television series "The Merchant" and by Jung Hae-kyun in the 2016 KBS2 series "Love in the Moonlight."[^94] These dramatizations, while taking creative liberties, have introduced Hong's story to new generations and contributed to ongoing public discussion about his historical role.

In academic discourse, Hong Gyeong-rae's rebellion holds a significant place in Korean historiography. The rebellion has been the subject of numerous books and academic studies, and continues to be a topic of interest for historians and scholars studying Korean history.[^95] Modern scholarship has examined the rebellion from various perspectives, including social history, economic history, political history, and cultural studies. Researchers have analyzed the rebellion's causes, including regional discrimination, economic exploitation, prophetic ideology, and class tensions.[^96]

The rebellion symbolizes the struggle for justice and equality in Korean historical memory.[^97] It represents a moment when oppressed populations organized to challenge structural injustice, even at great personal cost. This symbolic meaning transcends the specific historical context of early 19th-century Pyeongan Province, offering a narrative that resonates with later movements for social justice and equality in Korea.

Hong's legacy also extends to the specific issue of regional discrimination in Korea. The rebellion brought national attention to the systematic discrimination against Pyeongan Province and its people, a problem that had existed since the beginning of the Joseon period.[^98] While the rebellion did not immediately end this discrimination, it placed the issue prominently in historical consciousness and contributed to later discussions about regional equity and national unity.

The historiographical debates surrounding Hong Gyeong-rae reflect broader tensions in Korean historical interpretation. Discussions about whether he was a hero or a traitor, a revolutionary or a bandit, a visionary or an opportunist, continue to engage historians and the public alike. These debates are not merely academic exercises but reflect ongoing discussions about the nature of legitimate authority, the justification for resistance, and the evaluation of historical actors who used violence in pursuit of social change.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship and popular historical consciousness in Korea have increasingly viewed Hong Gyeong-rae in a sympathetic and even heroic light, recognizing his rebellion as an important expression of resistance against systemic injustice in Joseon society.

Progressive historians emphasize Hong's role in articulating the long-standing grievances of the Pyeongan Province population against regional discrimination. Scholar Sun Joo Kim identifies discrimination against high-level civil service examination passers from Pyeongan Province at the Joseon court as the primary cause of the rebellion.[^99] From this perspective, Hong served as a spokesperson for an entire region that had been systematically excluded from political power and subjected to contempt from the central government and Seoul elites. His rebellion brought these injustices into national consciousness and forced the government to at least temporarily address them.

The rebellion's role in exposing economic exploitation has also earned Hong praise from historians focused on class analysis and economic history. Pyeongan Province, thanks to its lucrative mining industry, was economically ahead of neighboring provinces and acted as a major trading hub, but ironically, this prosperity made the region a favored target of unfair, excessive taxation by the central government.[^100] Hong's rebellion highlighted these exploitative practices and demonstrated popular resistance to economic injustice. The rebels' distribution of stockpiled harvest grains after capturing government storehouses represents, in this view, an act of redistributive justice that addressed immediate hunger while making a political statement about proper resource allocation.[^101]

Nationalist historians, particularly those writing during and after the Japanese colonial period, have celebrated Hong as an early example of Korean resistance to oppression. The reinterpretation of Hong as a "hero or revolutionary" during the colonial period served to construct a historical narrative of Korean resistance that could inspire contemporary anti-colonial movements.[^102] This nationalist framing emphasizes Hong's willingness to challenge authority, his organizational capabilities, and his sacrifice for a cause greater than himself.

Hong's military and organizational achievements have garnered respect even from historians who may question his ultimate objectives or methods. The ten-year planning period demonstrates exceptional strategic patience and organizational discipline.[^103] The rapid conquest of most of Pyeongan Province north of the Cheongcheon River in just ten days showcases genuine military talent.[^104] The successful defense of Jeongju fortress for over three months against superior government forces reflects both Hong's military leadership and the dedication of his followers.[^105] These accomplishments establish Hong as a capable military commander and charismatic leader, regardless of how one evaluates his political objectives.

Supporters also point to Hong's personal character as revealed in specific actions. His order for proper burial of a government official who remained loyal to the dynasty, despite that official's opposition to the rebellion, demonstrates adherence to Confucian ethical principles and respect for personal virtue.[^106] This act suggests Hong was not motivated solely by personal ambition or vindictive anger but maintained moral standards even in rebellion. Such behavior complicates simple narratives of Hong as a mere bandit or opportunist.

Cultural scholars appreciate Hong's rebellion as a moment of genuine cross-class solidarity. The uprising saw participation from members of every caste, from impoverished peasants to yangban scholars, from miners to merchants.[^107] This unprecedented coalition suggests that Hong's message and leadership transcended traditional social boundaries and addressed grievances felt across Joseon society. The rebellion's ideology, combining Confucian concepts of virtuous governance with prophetic visions of dynastic transformation, offered a comprehensive alternative to the existing order that appealed to diverse constituencies.

The rebellion's inspiration for future movements is perhaps Hong's most enduring positive legacy. Historians note that Hong's uprising provided momentum for other popular armed uprisings seeking a more just society in different parts of Korea.[^108] The rebellion demonstrated that organized resistance was possible and could seriously challenge government authority. This demonstration effect continued to influence Korean popular movements throughout the 19th century and contributed to the larger Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894.[^109] From this perspective, Hong's rebellion, while unsuccessful in its immediate objectives, succeeded in its larger historical mission of inspiring resistance to injustice and demonstrating the possibility of popular agency in shaping political outcomes.

Contemporary scholars who study Korean history emphasize how the rebellion holds a significant place in Korean history and culture, symbolizing the struggle for justice and equality.[^110] This symbolic meaning has allowed Hong's legacy to transcend the specific historical context and speak to broader human concerns about dignity, justice, and resistance to oppression. The ongoing academic and popular interest in Hong, reflected in numerous books, academic studies, and media portrayals, demonstrates his continuing relevance to Korean historical consciousness.[^111]

### Negative Views

Despite the increasingly sympathetic modern view of Hong Gyeong-rae, significant criticisms of both the man and his rebellion persist among historians, and the Joseon government's contemporary condemnation reveals the perspective of those who saw Hong as a dangerous criminal and traitor.

The Joseon government's official position, naturally, viewed Hong as a traitor and rebel who threatened legitimate authority and social order. Government documents negatively portrayed Hong, framing the rebellion as criminal violence rather than justified resistance.[^112] Early commercial novels like Sinmirok defined him as a "traitor," reflecting this official interpretation.[^113] From the government's perspective, Hong violated the fundamental Confucian principle of loyalty to rightful authority and brought chaos and bloodshed to a previously stable region. The government's brutal suppression of the rebellion, including the execution of all male rebels above the age of ten, reflected its view that such treason deserved the harshest possible punishment.[^114]

Critics question the practical wisdom and moral justification of Hong's decision to launch the rebellion given the likely outcome. The rebellion resulted in tremendous human suffering, with thousands killed in battle or executed afterwards.[^115] In one battle alone, 69 rebels were beheaded, and when Jeongju fortress fell, all males above ten years old were executed.[^116][^117] While Hong cannot be held solely responsible for the government's brutal response, critics argue that a responsible leader should have anticipated such reprisals and weighed whether the rebellion's objectives justified the inevitable bloodshed. The aftermath brought harsh oppression of peasants and a strengthened government military presence in the region, arguably worsening conditions for the very people Hong sought to help.[^118]

Scholar Anders Karlsson offers important counterarguments to romantic interpretations of the rebellion. He notes that the manifesto written in classical Chinese would have been incomprehensible to the predominantly uneducated rebel army, suggesting its primary purpose was not to communicate with common soldiers but to legitimize the rebellion and seek support from educated elites.[^119] This observation raises questions about whether the rebellion truly represented grassroots popular resistance or was primarily an elite-led movement that mobilized peasants for objectives they may not have fully understood. Karlsson emphasizes the importance of prophetic ideology in the rebellion, suggesting that Hong may have cynically manipulated religious beliefs to recruit followers rather than acting from genuine conviction.[^120]

Hong's use of demonstrable falsehoods represents another point of criticism. His claims that Ming dynasty troops were secretly stationed in the area and would join the rebels, and later assertions that Qing troops would break the siege of Jeongju, were complete fabrications.[^121][^122] While defenders might argue these were necessary morale-boosting measures during desperate times, critics see them as evidence of a willingness to deceive followers and raise false hopes. When promised reinforcements never materialized, it likely damaged morale and contributed to the final collapse of resistance, suggesting that such deceptions were ultimately counterproductive.

The rebellion's strategic and tactical failures have been criticized by military historians. Hong's choice to defend Jeongju fortress, while initially sound given its strong walls and food supplies, became a fatal error when he failed to anticipate government forces' tunneling tactics.[^123] The government's use of eleven tons of gunpowder explosives to breach the walls suggests Hong lacked the military sophistication to counter experienced government commanders.[^124] A more capable military leader might have employed more mobile tactics rather than allowing his forces to be trapped in a siege they could not win.

The limited long-term impact of the rebellion on actual government policy has led some historians to question its ultimate significance. While the government acknowledged that corrupt officials and excessive taxation caused the rebellion and enacted some relief measures, no fundamental reforms were made to the taxation system.[^125][^126] Revolts continued even after 1864, suggesting the rebellion failed to achieve lasting structural change.[^127] From this perspective, Hong's uprising resulted in massive bloodshed and suffering without securing meaningful improvements in the lives of Pyeongan Province residents.

The internal betrayals that plagued the rebellion, such as Kim Chan-si's murder by a traitor seeking government rewards, suggest organizational and security weaknesses.[^128] Critics argue that Hong failed to establish the loyalty and security measures necessary for a sustained resistance movement. The relatively rapid collapse of the rebellion after the fall of Jeongju, with no significant subsequent resistance, indicates that Hong had not built an organizational structure capable of continuing the struggle after his death.

Some scholars question the class analysis of the rebellion, noting that while it included peasants, it was also supported by yangban scholars and wealthy landowners.[^129] This raises questions about whether the rebellion truly represented a popular uprising against elite oppression or was instead a regionally-based movement that included elites from Pyeongan Province seeking greater access to central power. From this critical perspective, Hong's rebellion might be better understood as a regional power struggle rather than a proto-revolutionary movement for social justice.
