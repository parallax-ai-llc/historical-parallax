## Summary

Dilma Vana Rousseff is a Brazilian economist and politician who served as the 36th President of Brazil from 2011 to 2016, becoming the first woman to hold the office. A former member of left-wing guerrilla groups during Brazil's military dictatorship, she was imprisoned and tortured before transitioning to mainstream politics. As Chief of Staff under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, she gained prominence before winning the presidency in 2010. Her tenure was marked by economic challenges, major protests, and ultimately impeachment in 2016 amid a political crisis, though she maintained her removal was a parliamentary coup rather than justified impeachment.

## Early Life and Background

Dilma Vana Rousseff was born on December 14, 1947, in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, to a middle-class family. Her father, Petar Rousseff (also known as Pedro Rousseff), was a Bulgarian immigrant lawyer and entrepreneur who had fled Bulgaria in the 1920s, while her mother, Dilma Jane da Silva, was a Brazilian teacher. Growing up in a politically aware household, Dilma was exposed to discussions about social justice and inequality from an early age, shaping her future political consciousness.

During her adolescence in the 1960s, Brazil was undergoing significant political turbulence. The military coup of 1964 established a dictatorship that would last for two decades, implementing authoritarian rule and suppressing political opposition. This environment profoundly influenced young Dilma, who became increasingly radicalized as she witnessed the erosion of democratic freedoms. She attended a Catholic school, Colégio Estadual Central, where she was known as an intelligent and politically engaged student.

Rousseff began her university education studying economics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in 1967. However, her academic pursuits were increasingly overshadowed by her growing involvement in left-wing political movements opposing the military dictatorship. The political climate of the late 1960s, marked by student protests and growing resistance to authoritarian rule, drew her deeper into clandestine political activities. Her formal education would be repeatedly interrupted by her underground resistance work, though she would later complete her degree.

The death of her father in 1962, when she was just 14 years old, had a lasting impact on Dilma. The loss of this influential figure during her formative years may have contributed to her determination and resilience. Her mother struggled financially after her father's death, and the family's economic circumstances changed significantly. These personal challenges, combined with the political repression she witnessed, forged a strong sense of social commitment that would define her entire political career.

## Rise to Power

Rousseff's path to power was long and unconventional, beginning with her participation in armed resistance against Brazil's military dictatorship. In the late 1960s, she joined the Comando de Libertação Nacional (COLINA, National Liberation Command), a Marxist urban guerrilla group that engaged in armed resistance against the regime. She later became involved with the Vanguarda Armada Revolucionária Palmares (VAR Palmares), another militant organization. Her involvement in these groups was not merely ideological—she participated in planning operations and served in leadership roles within these clandestine organizations.

In January 1970, Rousseff was arrested by military intelligence agents and subjected to imprisonment and torture for nearly three years. She was held in various detention facilities, including the infamous Tiradentes Prison in São Paulo, where political prisoners were routinely subjected to brutal interrogation methods. The torture she endured included electric shocks, beatings, and psychological abuse—experiences that would mark her permanently but also strengthen her resolve. She was eventually released in 1972 after spending 22 months in prison, and her experience became a defining element of her political identity.

After her release, Rousseff rebuilt her life, completing her economics degree at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, where she had relocated. She later pursued graduate studies in economics, though she never completed her doctorate. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as Brazil gradually transitioned toward democracy, she worked as an economist and became increasingly involved in legitimate political activities, particularly with the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in Rio Grande do Sul.

Rousseff's administrative career began in earnest when she was appointed Municipal Secretary of Treasury in Porto Alegre in 1986. Her competence in this role led to her appointment as Secretary of Energy of Rio Grande do Sul from 1991 to 1994 under Governor Alceu Collares. In this position, she demonstrated technical expertise and administrative capability, overseeing significant energy sector reforms. She later served as President of the Foundation of Economics and Statistics (FEE) from 1999 to 2000, further establishing her credentials as an economist and public administrator.

Her breakthrough to national prominence came when Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva won the presidency in 2002. Lula appointed Rousseff as Minister of Mines and Energy in 2003, a position where she played a crucial role in developing Brazil's energy policy. She was instrumental in formulating the regulatory framework for Brazil's pre-salt oil discoveries and managed complex energy sector challenges. Her performance impressed Lula, and in 2005, following a political scandal that forced the resignation of José Dirceu, Lula appointed her as Chief of Staff (Casa Civil), effectively making her the most powerful minister in his government.

As Chief of Staff from 2005 to 2010, Rousseff became Lula's right hand, managing the government's agenda and coordinating ministerial activities. Despite having little electoral experience and relatively low public recognition, Lula chose her as his successor, using his immense popularity to campaign on her behalf. In the 2010 presidential election, she won the runoff against José Serra with 56% of the vote, becoming Brazil's first female president and inheriting Lula's legacy of economic growth and social programs.

## Major Achievements

Rousseff's presidency saw several significant accomplishments, particularly in her first term. She continued and expanded social programs initiated under Lula, most notably Brasil Sem Miséria (Brazil Without Extreme Poverty), launched in 2011, which aimed to lift millions of Brazilians out of extreme poverty. This program coordinated various government initiatives, including Bolsa Família cash transfers, and succeeded in significantly reducing extreme poverty during her first years in office. According to government statistics, extreme poverty affected 9.6% of the population when she took office and had declined to 4.2% by 2012.[^1]

In education, Rousseff implemented the "More Doctors" (Mais Médicos) program in 2013, which brought thousands of foreign doctors, primarily from Cuba, to underserved rural and remote areas of Brazil. The program aimed to address the severe shortage of medical professionals in poor regions and was largely successful in improving healthcare access for marginalized populations. By 2015, the program had placed over 18,000 doctors in more than 4,000 municipalities, providing healthcare to approximately 63 million Brazilians who previously had limited access to medical services.[^2]

Rousseff's government made significant investments in infrastructure through the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC), which she had helped develop as Chief of Staff under Lula. The program funded major infrastructure projects including roads, airports, ports, and urban development. She also launched the "Science Without Borders" program in 2011, which provided scholarships for Brazilian students to study abroad in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, sending over 100,000 students to universities worldwide before the program was scaled back due to economic constraints.[^3]

On the international stage, Rousseff took strong positions on issues of sovereignty and digital privacy, particularly following revelations by Edward Snowden in 2013 that the U.S. National Security Agency had spied on her personal communications and on Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company. In response, she postponed a state visit to the United States and delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly condemning cyber-espionage, positioning Brazil as a defender of digital sovereignty. She also pushed for the development of secure Brazilian internet infrastructure and encryption systems.[^4]

Rousseff achieved re-election in 2014, defeating Aécio Neves in a closely contested runoff with 51.6% of the vote. This victory, though narrow, demonstrated continued support from her base despite growing economic challenges. Her government also presided over major international events, successfully hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup, despite protests and concerns about spending. Additionally, her administration advanced women's rights initiatives and appointed record numbers of women to ministerial positions, setting precedents for gender representation in Brazilian government.[^5]

In energy policy, an area where she had particular expertise, Rousseff oversaw the regulatory framework for developing Brazil's massive pre-salt oil reserves, potentially transforming Brazil into a major oil exporter. She also promoted renewable energy, particularly wind power, with Brazil's installed wind capacity expanding from 1 GW in 2011 to over 8 GW by 2016. Her government's energy matrix emphasized clean energy sources, with Brazil maintaining one of the world's cleanest energy portfolios.[^6]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Rousseff's presidency became increasingly mired in controversy, culminating in her impeachment in 2016. The most significant scandal was the massive corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash (Operação Lava Jato), which uncovered systematic bribery and kickback schemes involving Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company, and major construction firms. While Rousseff herself was never directly implicated in receiving bribes, the scandal engulfed her Workers' Party (PT) and many of her political allies, severely damaging her government's credibility. The investigation revealed that executives had paid billions in bribes to politicians and Petrobras officials in exchange for inflated contracts.[^7]

The economic crisis that deepened during her second term became perhaps her greatest failure. Brazil entered its worst recession in decades, with GDP contracting by 3.8% in 2015 and 3.6% in 2016. Unemployment rose sharply from 6.8% in 2014 to over 11% by 2016, while inflation exceeded the government's target range, reaching nearly 11% in 2015. Critics argued that Rousseff's interventionist economic policies, including price controls on fuel and electricity, market interventions, and increased government spending during her first term, had created fiscal imbalances that became unsustainable. Her government's "creative accounting" practices, using state banks to fund government programs without proper budgetary authorization, became a central issue in her impeachment.[^8]

The impeachment itself remains highly controversial. In 2016, Congress voted to impeach Rousseff for fiscal responsibility law violations, specifically for manipulating budget accounts and issuing decrees for unauthorized expenditures. While these practices (known as "pedaladas fiscais" or "fiscal pedaling") were technically illegal, many argued they were common administrative practices used by previous governments. Rousseff's supporters, including many international observers, characterized her impeachment as a "parliamentary coup" orchestrated by conservative opponents who lacked the votes to defeat her electorally. The fact that her vice president, Michel Temer, who led the impeachment effort, had been implicated in corruption himself lent credence to these claims.[^9]

Rousseff's management style drew significant criticism throughout her tenure. She was frequently described as technocratic, inflexible, and confrontational, lacking the political skills and charisma of her predecessor Lula. Critics noted her difficulty in building political coalitions, her strained relationships with Congress, and her seeming inability to communicate effectively with the public. Her approval ratings plummeted from over 60% in early 2013 to single digits by 2015, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with her leadership during the economic crisis.[^10]

The government's response to massive protests that erupted in June 2013 was widely criticized as inadequate and tone-deaf. Initially sparked by public transport fare increases, the demonstrations evolved into broader protests against corruption, poor public services, and excessive spending on the World Cup while social services deteriorated. Rather than addressing protesters' concerns effectively, Rousseff's government appeared defensive and disconnected. Her initial responses failed to calm the unrest, and the protests marked a turning point in public perception of her presidency.[^11]

Critics also pointed to her government's failure to implement necessary economic reforms, particularly to Brazil's unsustainable pension system and rigid labor laws. Her reluctance to pursue reforms that might alienate her political base contributed to the fiscal crisis. Additionally, her interventionist approach to state-owned enterprises, particularly Petrobras, was blamed for undermining business confidence and investment. After her re-election in 2014, her sudden shift toward austerity measures, appointing the market-friendly Joaquim Levy as Finance Minister, was seen as a betrayal by her supporters and did little to win over critics.[^12]

---

## Personal Life

Dilma Rousseff has been married twice. Her first marriage was to journalist Cláudio Galeno Linhares in 1968, a union that occurred during her involvement in guerrilla activities. The couple had one daughter, Paula Rousseff Araújo, born in 1976, who became a lawyer and political activist herself. Dilma and Cláudio divorced in the early 1980s. She later married lawyer Carlos Araújo in 2000, though the couple separated in 2016, shortly after her impeachment. Despite the separation, they have maintained a cordial relationship.[^13]

Those who know Rousseff personally often describe her as intelligent, determined, and detail-oriented, with a commanding presence and strong work ethic. Unlike many politicians, she is known for her reserved personality and discomfort with the performative aspects of political life. She rarely displays emotion publicly and maintains a serious, sometimes stern demeanor that contrasts sharply with the warm, gregarious style of her mentor Lula. This personality difference significantly affected her political effectiveness, as she struggled to connect emotionally with voters and build the personal relationships essential to Brazilian politics.[^14]

Rousseff is known to be an avid reader with interests in economics, political theory, and history. She has written articles on economic policy and energy issues, demonstrating her technical expertise. During her presidency, she maintained a relatively private personal life, avoiding the celebrity culture that surrounds many political leaders. She is not active on social media personally and prefers substantive policy discussions to public relations gestures, a trait that sometimes worked against her politically.[^15]

Her experience with torture and imprisonment during the dictatorship profoundly shaped her worldview and personal identity. She has spoken about these experiences in interviews, describing how the torture affected her physically and psychologically. The scars from this period, both literal and figurative, gave her a moral authority among those who opposed the dictatorship and contributed to her identity as a fighter and survivor. However, she has been relatively restrained in discussing these experiences publicly, preferring to focus on policy rather than personal history.[^16]

After her impeachment, Rousseff remained active in politics, though in a different capacity. She continued to speak out against what she considers the injustice of her removal and has participated in various political events supporting the Workers' Party and progressive causes. In 2023, following Lula's return to the presidency, she was appointed president of the New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the BRICS bank, based in Shanghai, China—a significant international position that reflected continued respect for her economic expertise and management capabilities in certain circles.[^17]

## Legacy

Dilma Rousseff's legacy is deeply contested, reflecting Brazil's polarized political landscape. For her supporters, she represents a historic breakthrough as Brazil's first female president and a continuation of the Workers' Party's commitment to social inclusion and poverty reduction. They point to her government's achievements in reducing extreme poverty, expanding healthcare and education access, and maintaining social programs despite economic headwinds. Her defenders argue that she was the victim of a misogynistic, politically motivated impeachment orchestrated by corrupt politicians who wanted to halt corruption investigations that threatened them.[^18]

The question of whether her impeachment was legitimate or constituted a "coup" remains central to debates about her legacy. Many legal scholars, international observers, and political scientists have questioned the impeachment, noting that the fiscal violations she was accused of were relatively minor technical breaches that previous presidents had committed without consequence. The fact that Michel Temer, who replaced her, and many of the legislators who voted to impeach her were subsequently implicated in far more serious corruption scandals has reinforced the view among her supporters that the impeachment was politically motivated rather than legally justified.[^19]

Rousseff's legacy as a champion of democratic resistance is significant, particularly among those who opposed Brazil's military dictatorship. Her biography as a former guerrilla fighter who was imprisoned and tortured, who then rose to become president, represents a powerful narrative of redemption and the triumph of democracy over authoritarianism. This aspect of her legacy has taken on renewed importance as Brazil grapples with the rise of far-right politics and nostalgia for military rule among some segments of society. Her experience serves as a reminder of the costs of dictatorship and the value of democratic governance.[^20]

However, critics view her presidency as a failure that contributed to Brazil's economic crisis and political instability. They argue that her interventionist economic policies, fiscal mismanagement, and inability to address corruption within her own party squandered the gains of the Lula years and set Brazil back economically. The recession that occurred during her second term resulted in millions of job losses and increased poverty, undermining the social progress of the previous decade. Her critics contend that her ideological rigidity and poor political management skills made her unsuited for the presidency despite her technical competence.[^21]

The gender dimension of her legacy is complex. As Brazil's first female president, Rousseff broke a significant barrier and served as a role model for women in politics. However, her presidency was marked by notably gendered attacks and sexist rhetoric from opponents, including degrading stickers, memes, and public comments that male presidents rarely face. Some scholars argue that sexism played a significant role in both public perceptions of her leadership style and the willingness of political elites to pursue her impeachment, suggesting that a male president with similar challenges might have been treated differently.[^22]

Rousseff's impeachment had lasting consequences for Brazilian democracy and politics. It deepened political polarization, established a precedent for removing presidents through impeachment on relatively minor charges, and contributed to political instability that continued in subsequent years. The crisis she weathered and ultimately succumbed to was part of a broader breakdown of Brazil's political system, culminating in the rise of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in 2018. Her removal is seen by many as a turning point that shifted Brazil's political trajectory significantly to the right, at least temporarily.[^23]

Internationally, Rousseff's presidency and impeachment attracted significant attention and concern. Many foreign governments and international organizations viewed her removal with skepticism, seeing it as politically motivated. Her stance on issues like digital sovereignty, South-South cooperation through BRICS, and defense of multilateralism left a mark on Brazil's international positioning. Her subsequent appointment to lead the New Development Bank suggests that her reputation and capabilities are valued in international financial institutions, even if her domestic political career ended in controversy.[^24]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic scholars view Dilma Rousseff as a transformative figure who advanced social justice and represented the aspirations of millions of poor Brazilians. Political scientist Alfredo Saad-Filho argues that her government continued the Workers' Party's project of reducing inequality and empowering marginalized communities, achieving significant poverty reduction despite facing a hostile political environment and economic headwinds beyond her control. He and others contend that her impeachment represented a "constitutional coup" designed to reverse progressive policies and return power to Brazil's traditional elites.[^25]

Feminist scholars have highlighted Rousseff's significance as a symbol of women's political empowerment in Latin America. Political scientist Leslie Schwindt-Bayer notes that Rousseff's election demonstrated that even in traditionally male-dominated political systems, women can reach the highest offices. Her government appointed record numbers of women to ministerial positions and advanced gender equality initiatives. Scholars like Mala Htun argue that the gendered nature of attacks against Rousseff—including sexualized imagery and rhetoric questioning her temperament and emotional stability—reveals the persistent barriers women face in politics, making her perseverance and achievements even more significant.[^26]

Economists and policy experts sympathetic to her approach credit Rousseff with attempting to maintain Brazil's social programs and infrastructure investments during difficult global economic conditions. They argue that the commodity price collapse and global economic slowdown, rather than her policies, were primarily responsible for Brazil's recession. Supporter economists like Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira contend that her interventionist approach was appropriate given Brazil's development challenges and that the austerity policies imposed after her removal proved economically damaging and socially regressive.[^27]

International observers and human rights advocates respect Rousseff for her principled stance on issues like digital privacy and sovereignty following the NSA spying revelations. Her willingness to confront the United States on these issues demonstrated independence in foreign policy. Organizations monitoring democratic backsliding in Latin America have generally viewed her impeachment as a concerning precedent that undermined democratic stability. Scholars like Perry Anderson have argued that her removal was part of a broader pattern of conservative restoration in Latin America, reversing the "pink tide" of left-wing governments.[^28]

Those familiar with her resistance to dictatorship continue to view her as a heroic figure who sacrificed her freedom and endured torture for democratic principles. This aspect of her biography gives her moral authority that transcends policy debates. Historians of Brazil's military period, such as James N. Green, have documented her courage and commitment during the resistance years, contributing to her legacy as a defender of democracy. Her personal story of transformation from guerrilla to president embodies Brazil's own transition from dictatorship to democracy, making her a symbolically important figure in Brazilian history.[^29]

### Negative Views

Critics of Rousseff's presidency argue that her economic mismanagement and political incompetence squandered Brazil's potential and reversed years of progress. Economist Arminio Fraga, former Central Bank president, has characterized her economic policies as "disastrous," pointing to interventionist measures that undermined market confidence, fiscal responsibility, and economic growth. Critics argue that her government's interference in Petrobras pricing, directed lending through state banks, and resistance to necessary reforms created the conditions for Brazil's severe recession, which caused suffering for millions of Brazilians.[^30]

Political scientists critical of her leadership emphasize her failure to build effective coalitions and manage Brazil's complex political system. Carlos Pereira and colleagues have argued that Rousseff's confrontational style and inability to engage in the political negotiations essential to Brazilian governance made her ineffective and contributed to the political crisis that ended her presidency. Unlike Lula, who excelled at political coalition-building, Rousseff's technocratic approach and interpersonal difficulties alienated potential allies and strengthened opponents, ultimately making her politically isolated and vulnerable.[^31]

Conservative and center-right commentators view the impeachment as legally justified and necessary to address serious violations of fiscal responsibility laws. Legal scholar Miguel Reale Júnior, who drafted the impeachment petition, argues that Rousseff's fiscal manipulations violated constitutional principles and justified removal. These critics reject characterizations of the impeachment as a coup, arguing that it followed constitutional procedures and was necessary to restore fiscal discipline and address governmental dysfunction. They contend that portraying legitimate impeachment as a coup undermines democratic accountability.[^32]

Critics also point to Rousseff's association with and defense of the Workers' Party despite overwhelming evidence of systematic corruption within the party during her tenure and Lula's presidency. While she was never personally implicated in corruption, her failure to acknowledge or adequately address the massive schemes revealed by Operation Car Wash damaged her credibility. Political commentator Reinaldo Azevedo and others argue that her loyalty to corrupt allies and refusal to break with the party's corrupt practices made her complicit in the corruption that eroded public trust in Brazilian institutions.[^33]

Some critics from the left argue that Rousseff betrayed progressive principles through her austerity turn after the 2014 election. By appointing Joaquim Levy, a market-oriented economist, as Finance Minister and pursuing spending cuts and conservative economic policies, she abandoned the Workers' Party's base and violated campaign promises. These critics, including activists and labor union leaders, argue that this betrayal demoralized supporters and contributed to her political collapse while failing to win over opponents. Her inability to maintain a coherent political-economic project is seen as a fundamental failure of leadership.[^34]

Commentators across the political spectrum have criticized her management of the 2013 protests and subsequent political unrest. Her government appeared unable to understand or respond to legitimate public grievances about corruption, poor services, and political dysfunction. This disconnect from public sentiment, combined with her poor communication skills, reinforced perceptions of an out-of-touch leader unable to connect with ordinary Brazilians. Journalists and political observers noted that her favorability ratings collapsed in part because she seemed incapable of the empathetic communication that modern democratic leadership requires.[^35]
