## Summary

Socrates (470-399 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher from Athens, widely considered the founder of Western philosophy and ethics. Unlike earlier philosophers who focused on cosmology and nature, Socrates pioneered the examination of moral concepts, virtue, and the best way to live through dialectical questioning—the famous "Socratic method." He wrote nothing himself; our knowledge comes primarily from his students Plato and Xenophon, and critic Aristophanes. A stonemason's son who became Athens' gadfly, Socrates spent his days in the agora questioning fellow citizens about justice, courage, piety, and knowledge, exposing contradictions in their beliefs. His relentless questioning and criticism of Athenian democracy led to his trial and execution by hemlock poison in 399 BC on charges of impiety and corrupting youth. His death became philosophy's defining martyrdom, and his insistence that "the unexamined life is not worth living" established critical self-reflection as the cornerstone of philosophical inquiry.

## Early Life

Born around 470 BC in Athens, Socrates came from modest origins:

**Family:**
- Father: Sophroniscus, a stonemason or sculptor
- Mother: Phaenarete, a midwife
- Socrates later compared his philosophical method to midwifery—helping others give birth to ideas

**Youth:**
- Likely learned his father's trade (stonework)
- Received typical Athenian education: music, gymnastics, grammar
- Lived through Athens' Golden Age under Pericles
- Witnessed Athens' transformation into cultural and intellectual center of Greece

**Marriage:**
- Married Xanthippe, reportedly a difficult wife (though sources hostile)
- Had three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, Menexenus
- Neglected family duties for philosophy, causing poverty

---

## Military Service

Socrates served as a hoplite (heavy infantryman) in three campaigns:

**Battle of Potidaea** (432-429 BC):
- Saved Alcibiades' life
- Showed remarkable endurance and courage
- Reportedly stood motionless in thought for 24 hours

**Battle of Delium** (424 BC):
- Athenian defeat
- Retreated with composure while others panicked
- Protected fellow soldiers

**Battle of Amphipolis** (422 BC):
- Another Athenian defeat
- Continued demonstrating courage

These experiences showed Socrates valued duty and courage, influencing his later ethical philosophy.

## The Socratic Method

### Dialectical Questioning

Socrates developed **elenchus** (ἔλεγχος)—cross-examination revealing contradictions:

**Process:**
1. Interlocutor makes a claim (e.g., "Justice is helping friends and harming enemies")
2. Socrates asks clarifying questions
3. Through questioning, contradictions emerge
4. Original claim is refuted or refined
5. Usually ends in aporia (puzzlement) rather than definitive answer

**Purpose:**
- Expose false knowledge
- Recognize ignorance as first step to wisdom
- Stimulate critical thinking
- Foster intellectual humility

**Famous Example** (from Plato's *Euthyphro*):
- Euthyphro claims to know piety
- Socrates asks for definition
- Euthyphro: "Piety is what the gods love"
- Socrates: "Do gods love piety because it is pious, or is it pious because gods love it?"
- Euthyphro realizes he doesn't truly understand piety

### "I Know That I Know Nothing"

Socrates' famous paradox:
- Most people think they know things they don't
- Socrates knows he doesn't know
- This awareness makes him wiser than others
- True wisdom is recognizing one's ignorance

**Oracle at Delphi:**
- Oracle declared no one wiser than Socrates
- Socrates puzzled, since he knew nothing
- Questioned supposedly wise men (politicians, poets, craftsmen)
- Found they claimed knowledge they lacked
- Socrates wiser because he didn't pretend to know

## Core Philosophy

### Ethics and Virtue

**Knowledge is Virtue:**
- No one does wrong willingly
- Wrong action results from ignorance
- If you truly know what's good, you'll do it
- Vice comes from not knowing the good

**The Good Life:**
- Virtue (arete, ἀρετή) is supreme good
- External goods (wealth, power, pleasure) secondary
- "It is better to suffer injustice than to commit it"
- Soul's health more important than body or reputation

**Self-Knowledge:**
> "Know thyself" (Delphic maxim)
- Self-examination essential
- "The unexamined life is not worth living"
- Philosophy as care of the soul (epimeleia tes psyches)

### Political Views

**Critique of Democracy:**
- Athenian democracy elected leaders by lot
- Socrates compared this to choosing ship's captain by lottery
- Believed governance requires expertise, not popular opinion
- Got him in trouble with democratic Athens

**Moral Absolutism:**
- Justice doesn't depend on majority vote
- Truth not determined by consensus  
- Philosopher must follow truth over popular opinion
- Better to suffer death than act unjustly

---

## The Trial and Death

### Background to Trial (399 BC)

**Political Context:**
- Athens lost Peloponnesian War to Sparta (404 BC)
- Thirty Tyrants ruled briefly (404-403 BC), many were Socrates' associates
- Democracy restored, wanted scapegoats
- Socrates associated with Critias (Tyrant leader) and Alcibiades (traitor)

**Cultural Context:**
- Sophists had made Atheism and skepticism fashionable
- Conservative backlash against intellectual inquiry
- Aristophanes' play *The Clouds* (423 BC) mocked Socrates as sophist
- Socrates conflated with sophists in public mind

### The Charges

**Official Indictment:**
1. **Impiety**: Not recognizing Athenian gods, introducing new divinities
2. **Corrupting Youth**: Teaching young men to question authority

**Real Reasons:**
- Political associations (Alcibiades, Critias)
- Annoying powerful people by exposing ignorance
- Questioning democratic values
- Being Athens' "gadfly"—stinging but irritating

### The Defense (Plato's *Apology*)

Socrates defended himself before 500 jurors:

**On Impiety:**
- Claims he has divine sign (daimonion) warning him what not to do
- Says he serves god by exposing false wisdom
- Questions Meletus (accuser) using Socratic method in court

**On Corrupting Youth:**
- Who would intentionally corrupt their neighbors?
- Young men follow him voluntarily
- Their fathers should testify against him if harmed—none do

**On Proposed Punishment:**
- If convicted, must propose counter-penalty
- Prosecution proposed death
- Socrates sarcastically proposed Athens should reward him with free meals
- Finally suggested small fine
- This attitude angered jurors

### Verdict and Sentence

**First Vote (Guilty):**
- 280 guilty, 220 innocent
- Narrow margin

**Second Vote (Penalty):**
- After Socrates' arrogant counter-proposal
- Overwhelming vote for death
- More voted for death than for guilt (Socrates' attitude turned some)

### Final Days

**Prison:**
- Delayed execution due to religious festival
- Friends visited, urged escape
- Crito offered money and plans

**Refusing Escape** (*Crito*):
Socrates explained why he must accept sentence:
- Has tacitly agreed to obey Athens' laws by living there
- Breaking laws would harm Athens
- Can't do wrong even if wronged
- Must practice what he preached

**Last Day** (*Phaedo*):
- Discussed immortality of soul
- Remained calm and cheerful
- Comforted weeping friends
- Bathed to spare others washing his corpse

**Death:**
- Drank hemlock poison calmly
- Walked around until legs grew heavy
- Lay down as poison ascended
- Final words: "Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Pay the debt." (Asclepius was god of healing—perhaps death heals life's disease)
- Died peacefully

## The Socratic Problem

### Sources Conflict

We have no writings by Socrates, only accounts by others:

**Plato's Socrates:**
- Most famous and influential source
- Brilliant dialectician
- Discusses theory of Forms, immortality  
- Later dialogues may reflect Plato's views more than Socrates'

**Xenophon's Socrates:**
- More practical, less philosophical
- Emphasized conventional piety
- Less interesting philosophically
- Possibly more historically accurate?

**Aristophanes' Socrates:**
- Satirical portrayal in *The Clouds*
- Sophist running "Thinkery"
- Teaching about air and clouds
- Clearly unfair caricature

**Aristotle's Comments:**
- Distinguished Socrates from Plato
- Credited Socrates with inductive reasoning and universal definitions
- Said Socrates didn't separate Forms from particulars (Plato did)

**The Problem:**
Which Socrates is real? Scholars debate endlessly. Consensus:
- Historical Socrates practiced elenchus
- Focused on ethics, not cosmology
- Claimed ignorance
- Was executed
- Beyond this, details uncertain
