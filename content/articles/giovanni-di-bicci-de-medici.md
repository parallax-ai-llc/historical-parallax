## Summary

Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici was the founder of the Medici Bank and the patriarch who established the Medici family's wealth and influence. He made the Medici Bank profitable by securing the account of the Vatican, which became the cornerstone of the family's fortune. His political strategy of quiet influence rather than open power set the pattern his descendants would follow. He laid the financial foundation for the Medici dynasty's centuries of dominance.
