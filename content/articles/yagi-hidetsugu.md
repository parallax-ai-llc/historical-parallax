## Summary

Yagi Hidetsugu was a Japanese electrical engineer who co-invented the Yagi-Uda antenna with his student Shintaro Uda. This directional antenna became the most widely used antenna design in the world, used in television reception, radar, and communications. Ironically, Japan did not initially appreciate the invention, while Allied forces used it extensively in WWII.
