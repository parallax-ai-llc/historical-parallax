## Summary

Jun Kondo is a Japanese theoretical physicist who discovered the Kondo effect in 1964, explaining the anomalous behavior of electrical resistance in metals containing magnetic impurities at low temperatures. The Kondo effect became one of the central problems in condensed matter physics and led to advances in understanding strongly correlated electron systems.
