## Summary
Dr. Marcel Petiot was a French doctor and serial killer who murdered at least 26 people during the Nazi occupation of Paris. He posed as a resistance network operator, promising to help Jews and others escape occupied France, then robbed and killed them. He was guillotined in 1946.

## Early Life
Born January 17, 1897, in Auxerre, France. He served in WWI and studied medicine. He became a doctor and was elected mayor of Villeneuve-sur-Yonne. He had prior convictions for theft and fraud. He maintained a medical practice in Paris during the German occupation. [^1]

## Criminal Career
During WWII, Petiot told Jews and others fleeing the Nazis that he ran an escape network to Argentina. Victims paid large sums and were told they needed vaccinations before travel. Petiot injected them with cyanide, then stole their valuables. He killed at least 26 people at his property at 21 Rue Le Sueur. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
On March 11, 1944, neighbors complained of foul-smelling smoke. Police found a coal stove full of human remains. Petiot initially claimed the victims were Nazis and collaborators he'd killed as a resistance fighter. He was arrested in October 1944, tried, and guillotined on May 25, 1946. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

- Posed as a resistance hero while being a predatory killer
- Profited enormously from his victims' stolen valuables
- Used medical expertise to kill efficiently
