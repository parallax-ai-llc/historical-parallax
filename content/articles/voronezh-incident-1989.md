## Summary

The Voronezh UFO incident is one of the most bizarre and widely publicized UFO cases in Soviet history. On September 27, 1989, in the city of Voronezh (about 300 miles south of Moscow), a group of children and several adults witnessed a deep red sphere land in a public park.

According to the official Soviet news agency **TASS**, witnesses saw three-eyed giant aliens (approx. 3-4 meters tall) and a small robotic entity emerge from the craft. The report claimed the aliens used a "ray gun" to make a teenage boy temporarily vanish. The story made headlines worldwide (including the *New York Times* and *Time* magazine) because it was one of the first times a state-controlled Soviet media outlet reported a UFO landing as fact rather than dismissing it.[^1]

## The Incident

### The Landing (September 27, 1989)
Around 6:30 PM, children playing soccer in a park in the Levoberezhny District noticed a pinkish/red glow in the sky.
*   **The Object:** A dark red sphere (approx. 10 meters in diameter) circled the area and then touched down.
*   **The Occupants:** A hatch opened, and witnesses saw huge humanoid figures. They were described as giants with very small heads, wearing silver overalls and bronze boots. They appeared to have three eyes (two white, one red and pivoting).
*   **The Robot:** Accompanied by the giants was a small, box-like robot with buttons on its chest.[^2]

### The "Disappearance"
One of the most terrifying details involved a 16-year-old boy. The boy allegedly screamed in fear, at which point one of the aliens pointed a tube-like device (ray gun) at him. The boy vanished instantly.
*   **Return:** The aliens reportedly took soil samples, boarded their craft, and flew away. As soon as the craft departed, the boy materialized back in the same spot, unharmed but frozen in shock.[^3]

## TASS Coverage and Investigation

What made this case historically significant was the reaction of **TASS** (Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union). Under Gorbachev's policy of *Glasnost* (openness), TASS released a straightforward report titled "UFO Lands in Voronezh."
*   **Scientific Claim:** The report cited Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, confirming "landing traces."
*   **Physical Evidence:** Investigators reportedly found:
    *   A depressed circle in the ground (20 meters in diameter).
    *   Four deep indentations (from landing gear) weighing several tons.
    *   Elevated radiation levels and anomalous magnetic readings.
    *   A piece of "non-earthly" rock (later disputed as hematite).[^4]

## Skepticism and Explanations

### Media Sensationalism
Western journalists were skeptical that TASS would report such a tabloid-style story. It was later revealed that while TASS reported it, the source was largely based on the children's testimony and local ufologists, not rigorous military verification.
*   **Misinterpretation:** Some scientists involved (like Silanov) later claimed their quotes were embellished or taken out of context by reporters to make the landing seem more definitive than the data supported.

### Child Witnesses
Critics argue the core of the story relies entirely on impressionable children who may have influenced each other's stories (folie à deux). The descriptions of "three-eyed giants" and "robots" mirror science fiction tropes popular in Soviet media at the time.[^5]

## Legacy

The Voronezh incident marked the peak of "UFO mania" in the dying days of the Soviet Union. It remains a prime example of how *Glasnost* allowed for the explosion of paranormal topics in previously censored Soviet media.
