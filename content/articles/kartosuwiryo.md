## Summary

Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwiryo (1905-1962) was an Indonesian Islamic political leader who led the Darul Islam rebellion against the Indonesian government from 1949 to 1962[^1]. He proclaimed the establishment of Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State) on August 7, 1949, seeking to establish an Islamic theocracy based on sharia law in opposition to the secular Pancasila ideology of the Indonesian Republic[^2]. A former medical student who became a protégé of nationalist leader Tjokroaminoto, Kartosuwiryo led one of the most prolonged and bloody insurgencies in post-independence Indonesian history before his capture and execution in 1962[^3]. His legacy remains controversial, viewed by some as a religious martyr and by others as a separatist rebel who threatened national unity[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwiryo was born on January 7, 1905, in Cepu, a small oil-producing town in North Central Java[^5]. He was one of seven siblings born to a family of modest means; his father, also named Kartosuwiryo, worked as a mantri candu (opium overseer), a minor position within the Dutch colonial administration[^6]. Despite his humble origins, Kartosuwiryo received an education that was exceptional for indigenous Indonesians of his generation, attending Dutch-medium schools that were typically reserved for the colonial elite and their select protégés[^7].

His early education began at the Tweede Inlandsche School, and after graduating, he was sent to Rembang to attend the Hollandsch Inlandsche School[^8]. This exposure to Western education would profoundly shape his worldview, providing him with the analytical tools and linguistic capabilities that would later serve him as a political writer and organizer. In his youth, Kartosuwiryo displayed considerable intellectual promise, which led him to pursue higher education at the prestigious Nederlands-Indische Artsen School (NIAS), the Netherlands Indies Medical College in Surabaya, beginning around 1923[^9].

During his time in Surabaya, Kartosuwiryo's life took a decisive turn that would redirect his trajectory from medicine to politics. While attending medical school, he boarded at the house of Hadji Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto (1882-1934), one of the most prominent Islamic nationalist leaders of the early twentieth century and a leading figure in Sarekat Islam[^10]. Tjokroaminoto's organization counted over two million members at its peak and represented the most powerful expression of Islamic political consciousness in colonial Indonesia[^11]. Living in Tjokroaminoto's household placed Kartosuwiryo at the epicenter of Indonesian nationalist ferment, where he encountered other future leaders of the independence movement, including the young Sukarno, who would later become Indonesia's first president[^12].

The influence of Tjokroaminoto proved decisive. Kartosuwiryo became deeply involved in the activities of the Partai Sarekat Islam Indonesia (PSII), the political party that emerged from the earlier Sarekat Islam movement[^13]. He abandoned his medical studies entirely to dedicate himself to political activism, a decision that reflected both his ideological commitment and his recognition that the struggle for Indonesian independence required full-time dedication[^14]. He became a regular writer for the SI newspaper Fadjar Asia, where he demonstrated his commitment to Islamic ideology through articles that criticized colonial policies, socio-economic injustices, police abuses of power, and Dutch claims of religious and political "neutrality"[^15]. His writings also addressed the international dimension of the nationalist struggle for merdeka (independence), revealing his awareness of global anti-colonial movements[^16].

Kartosuwiryo participated in the famous Youth Pledge of 1928, a watershed moment in Indonesian nationalism that brought together diverse youth organizations to proclaim a unified Indonesian identity transcending ethnic and regional divisions[^17]. By the mid-1930s, his dedication and organizational abilities had elevated him to a high rank within the PSII[^18]. His political formation under Tjokroaminoto's mentorship during the 1920s would fundamentally shape his career in the service of political Islam, instilling in him the conviction that Islamic principles should form the foundation of an independent Indonesian state[^19].

## Rise to Power

Kartosuwiryo's ascent within the Islamic nationalist movement accelerated following Tjokroaminoto's death in 1934. Together with Abikusno Tjokrosujoso, Kartosuwiryo assumed control of the PSII, and under their leadership, the party adopted a much more militant anti-colonial stance[^20]. This period marked the beginning of Kartosuwiryo's gradual radicalization, as he became increasingly convinced that compromise with Dutch colonial authorities was both morally unacceptable and strategically counterproductive[^21]. His uncompromising views on non-cooperation with the colonial government made him a controversial and polarizing figure within the broader nationalist movement[^22].

In 1929, Kartosuwiryo relocated to Malangbong, a town between Garut and Tasikmalaya in West Java, where he intensively studied Islam with local religious leaders including Kiai Jusuf Tauziri and Kiai Ardiwisastra[^23]. This immersion in traditional Islamic learning complemented his earlier exposure to modernist Islamic thought in urban centers. While in Malangbong, he met and married the daughter of a local PSII leader, establishing family ties that would anchor him in the region for the remainder of his life[^24]. He settled permanently in the Garut area and established a madrasa (Islamic school), positioning himself as both a political organizer and a religious educator[^25].

In 1937, Kartosuwiryo made the decisive break that would set him on the path toward armed rebellion. He resigned from the PSII to establish his own political movement explicitly advocating for a future Islamic State of Indonesia based on Islamic law[^26]. This split reflected his growing frustration with what he perceived as insufficient commitment to Islamic principles within the mainstream nationalist movement. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, Kartosuwiryo consistently advocated for an Islamic state, seeking to implement Tjokroaminoto's teaching that Islamic principles should be applied in the widest possible manner to all aspects of national life[^27].

The Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942-1945) provided Kartosuwiryo with new opportunities to build his organizational and military capacity. During this period, he established armed militias in the Garut area, one of many such groups that the Japanese supported and armed to help resist any future Allied invasion[^28]. These militias would later form the core of his rebel forces. The Japanese also created Hizbullah, an Islamic youth volunteer force established on December 8, 1944, with an estimated 25,000 personnel consisting of Muslim youths organized as a reserve force for the Defenders of the Homeland (PETA)[^29]. Unlike PETA, which was under Japanese Army command, Hizbullah's command structure lay with the Masyumi Party, giving Islamic political leaders significant influence over armed formations[^30].

Following Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence on August 17, 1945, Kartosuwiryo initially participated in the new Masyumi political party, serving as a charismatic leading figure alongside other Islamic nationalists[^31]. Masyumi's chief aims were the achievement of Indonesian independence and the establishment of a state governed by Islamic principles, and it played a dominant role in Indonesian politics from 1945 to 1949 alongside the Indonesian National Party (PNI) and the Socialist Party of Indonesia (PSI)[^32]. However, Kartosuwiryo became increasingly disillusioned with the Republican government's willingness to compromise with returning Dutch colonial forces and its adoption of the secular Pancasila ideology rather than Islamic law as the foundation of the new state[^33].

The breaking point came with the Renville Agreement of January 17, 1948, an unsuccessful attempt to resolve disputes with the Dutch that required Republican forces to withdraw from much of West Java[^34]. Members of the Republican Army who had come from Islamic militias like Hizbullah and Sabilillah felt betrayed by the Indonesian government for ratifying the agreement, which recognized many areas behind the van Mook Line as de jure Dutch territory[^35]. While the Republican government characterized this withdrawal as a strategic hijrah (migration) to preserve military strength for future struggle, Kartosuwiryo rejected this interpretation, arguing that such tactical retreat was not in the spirit of Islamic jihad but rather represented an unacceptable compromise with colonial oppression[^36]. He chose to remain in West Java and continue guerrilla warfare against the occupying Dutch forces, even as official Republican forces withdrew[^37].

## Major Achievements

On August 7, 1949, in Cimambang, West Java, Kartosuwiryo proclaimed the establishment of the Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State), with himself as Imam and commander-in-chief[^38]. This proclamation represented the culmination of his decades-long advocacy for an Islamic state and marked the beginning of what would become a thirteen-year armed struggle against the Indonesian Republic. The declaration came at a moment when the Dutch colonial administration was collapsing and the Republican government was consolidating its control over the archipelago following the formal transfer of sovereignty in December 1949[^39]. Kartosuwiryo's refusal to acknowledge Republican authority positioned him as the leader of the most significant armed opposition to the new Indonesian state[^40].

Under Kartosuwiryo's leadership, Darul Islam (the common name for his movement, meaning "House of Islam") developed a sophisticated organizational structure and ideology. He made Islam the foundation of his political program, arguing that every political struggle must be grounded in political faith, which he equated with ideology and realism[^41]. The movement implemented the concept of hijrah (migration for faith) and jihad (struggle in the path of God) as fundamental organizing principles[^42]. Kartosuwiryo's writings during this period revealed interesting contradictions in his intellectual orientation: on one hand, he was mystically inclined and deeply immersed in Sufism, which drew criticism from some of his Sarekat Islam colleagues; on the other hand, he was a hard-nosed, ideologically fervent Islamic politician with clear revolutionary objectives[^43].

During the 1950s, a weak central government and uncoordinated military response allowed Darul Islam to flourish, eventually controlling approximately one-third of West Java[^44]. The movement launched raids that reached as far as the outskirts of Jakarta, demonstrating its military capabilities and the vulnerability of the Republican government[^45]. Kartosuwiryo's success in maintaining this insurgency owed much to his understanding of rural Javanese society and his ability to mobilize peasant grievances against both colonial exploitation and Republican centralization. The rebellion spread beyond West Java to four other provinces, as Islamic rebels in South Sulawesi and Aceh joined Darul Islam and acknowledged Kartosuwiryo as their highest authority, though in practice there was little coordination between the rebels in different provinces[^46].

Kartosuwiryo established governmental institutions within his Islamic state, including Islamic courts, taxation systems, and educational facilities based on religious instruction. He positioned himself not merely as a rebel leader but as the legitimate Imam of an alternative Indonesian state founded on Islamic law rather than secular nationalism[^47]. In 1950, he sent a letter to President Sukarno and Prime Minister Mohammad Natsir, arguing that political Islam represented the only effective weapon to fight against communism and proposing cooperation on this basis, though his proposal was ignored by the Indonesian government[^48]. This outreach demonstrated Kartosuwiryo's view of himself as a legitimate political actor rather than merely an insurgent, and his conviction that the Republican government was making a strategic error in rejecting Islamic governance.

The Darul Islam movement under Kartosuwiryo's leadership became the most bloody and intractable of the many regional conflicts that beset Indonesia during the 1950s and early 1960s[^49]. The insurgency's resilience demonstrated both the depth of support for Islamic political alternatives in certain regions and the organizational and ideological coherence that Kartosuwiryo had managed to instill in his movement. His ability to sustain this rebellion for over a decade against an increasingly consolidated state represents a significant, if controversial, achievement in the context of post-colonial state formation.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Kartosuwiryo's rebellion resulted in enormous human suffering and loss of life across multiple provinces of Indonesia. The Darul Islam insurgency was characterized by violent tactics that targeted both government forces and civilian populations, contributing to a death toll that numbered in the tens of thousands over the course of the thirteen-year conflict[^50]. As military pressure intensified and his movement became increasingly isolated, Kartosuwiryo declared "total war" in 1961, leading to an escalation in which Darul Islam guerrillas increasingly employed terror tactics and banditry against civilians[^51]. These actions further alienated the rural populations that had previously provided the movement with shelter and support, undermining the rebellion's claim to represent genuine popular aspirations.

Critics, both during his lifetime and subsequently, accused Kartosuwiryo of placing religious ideology above national unity, thereby contributing to the fragmentation of the newly independent Indonesian state during its most vulnerable formative period. The rebellion diverted military resources and governmental attention away from economic development and nation-building at a critical juncture in Indonesian history[^52]. Secular nationalists viewed his rejection of the Pancasila ideology—which attempted to accommodate religious, nationalist, and socialist principles within a unified framework—as dangerously sectarian and incompatible with Indonesia's religious and ethnic diversity[^53].

The official Indonesian historical narrative, constructed particularly during the New Order regime of President Suharto, characterized Kartosuwiryo as a separatist rebel and enemy of national unity rather than as an Islamic nationalist leader[^54]. This displacement of his Islamic motivations served nation-building purposes by portraying political Islam as a negative and divisive force incompatible with Indonesian nationalism[^55]. The government's characterization emphasized the accusation that Kartosuwiryo had attempted to assassinate President Sukarno, for which he was convicted at his military court-martial[^56]. This charge reinforced the official narrative that positioned him as a traitor to the nation rather than as a political opponent with a competing vision of Indonesian statehood.

Many Indonesian nationalists, including former comrades from the independence struggle, viewed Kartosuwiryo's rebellion as a betrayal of the unified anti-colonial movement. In his autobiography, Sukarno recalled their earlier friendship, noting that "in 1918 Kartosuwiryo was a dear friend. We worked side by side with Tjokro [Cokroaminoto] for our country. In the '20s in Bandung we lived, ate, and dreamed together"[^57]. This personal dimension to their later antagonism added a tragic element to the conflict between the Islamic state and the secular Republic, suggesting that what emerged as a fundamental ideological divide had not been predetermined but resulted from choices made during the tumultuous post-independence period[^58].

The brutality employed by both sides in the conflict—government forces as well as Darul Islam fighters—contributed to cycles of violence and reprisal that devastated communities throughout West Java and other affected regions. The "fence of legs" strategy introduced by the Indonesian military in 1957, which involved encircling guerrilla mountain bases and cutting off supply and escape routes, forced rebels to surrender or face annihilation[^59]. While militarily effective, such tactics also resulted in significant hardship for civilian populations caught between the two sides.

## Personal Life

Kartosuwiryo's personal life remained largely subordinated to his political and religious mission, with available historical sources focusing primarily on his public role rather than his private affairs. What is known suggests a man whose personal choices were consistently guided by his ideological commitments and whose family relationships were intertwined with his political network.

His marriage to the daughter of a local PSII leader in Malangbong reflects the typical pattern of political marriages within Indonesia's Islamic nationalist movement, cementing alliances between different nodes of the organizational network while simultaneously integrating him into the social fabric of rural West Java[^60]. His wife remained with him throughout the insurgency; when Indonesian forces captured Kartosuwiryo at his hideout on Mount Geber in June 1962, his wife and personal commander, Kurnia, were captured alongside him[^61]. This detail suggests her enduring loyalty and her willingness to share the hardships and dangers of his fugitive existence during the final years of the rebellion.

Evidence suggests that Kartosuwiryo had children, as one of his grandsons has been documented describing him vaguely as an "intellectual Muslim"[^62]. However, specific information about the number and names of his children, their experiences during the rebellion, or their subsequent fates after his execution remains largely absent from available historical sources. This absence reflects both the deliberate obscuring of connections to a figure officially designated as a rebel and traitor, and the broader pattern in which Indonesian historiography has focused on Kartosuwiryo's political role rather than his personal relationships.

His intellectual character combined mystical spirituality with political rigor. Contemporaries noted his immersion in Sufism, which drew criticism from some Sarekat Islam colleagues who favored a more rationalist approach to Islamic reform[^63]. This mystical orientation coexisted with his reputation as a hard-nosed political organizer and ideologue, suggesting a complex personality that integrated spiritual depth with practical revolutionary commitment[^64]. His establishment of a madrasa in Malangbong indicates that he saw himself not merely as a political leader but also as an educator responsible for transmitting Islamic knowledge to future generations[^65].

The final years of Kartosuwiryo's life were spent in hiding, moving between mountain hideouts as Indonesian military pressure intensified. The declaration of martial law in 1957 and the establishment of Guided Democracy by Sukarno in 1959 marked a turning point that strengthened the government's counter-insurgency capabilities[^66]. By the time of his capture in 1962, Kartosuwiryo was an aging rebel leader whose movement had been systematically dismantled. In captivity, he issued orders for his followers to surrender, suggesting either pragmatic recognition that further resistance was futile or a desire to prevent additional bloodshed[^67].

There were reports that President Sukarno wept when informed that his former friend had been executed by firing squad on September 5, 1962[^68]. If true, this detail adds poignant complexity to their relationship, suggesting that despite their profound political antagonism, some emotional connection persisted from their earlier shared struggles in the nationalist movement.

## Legacy

The legacy of Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwiryo remains deeply contested, reflecting ongoing debates about the role of Islam in Indonesian politics and the contested narratives of the nation's founding period. His transformation from nationalist leader to "separatist rebel" and, for some, into a "martyr for Islam," illustrates how historical memory is constructed and reconstructed according to changing political circumstances[^69].

In official Indonesian historiography, particularly during the New Order regime (1966-1998), Kartosuwiryo was portrayed primarily as a separatist who threatened national unity, with his Islamic motivations systematically downplayed or dismissed[^70]. This narrative displacement served the state-building project by characterizing political Islam as inherently divisive and positioning the secular Pancasila ideology as the only legitimate foundation for Indonesian national identity[^71]. The elision of Islam from reconstructed accounts of Kartosuwiryo's intentions allowed for two reconstitutive processes: one that portrayed political Islam negatively, and another that could paradoxically transform Kartosuwiryo into a martyr figure for those who rejected the official narrative[^72].

Even though the Negara Islam Indonesia and Darul Islam were crushed by the Indonesian military more than half a century ago, the movement's ideological legacy persisted. Some splinter groups and cells of the NII continue to remain active underground[^73]. More significantly, veterans of Darul Islam later helped establish Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), the still-extant regional militant network that evolved from the long-established Darul Islam movement into an organization with links to Al-Qaeda and strongly influenced by Osama bin Laden's ideology[^74]. The connection between Kartosuwiryo's movement and later terrorist organizations became tragically concrete with the 2002 Bali bombings and other devastating attacks conducted by Jemaah Islamiyah[^75].

The ideological and organizational connections linking Darul Islam to Jemaah Islamiyah operated through intermediate phases. Following Kartosuwiryo's execution in 1962, his ideas were reinterpreted by subsequent leaders, resulting in the emergence of the Komando Jihad movement of the 1970s and 1980s, led by former Darul Islam members[^76]. Key figures like Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir, who became widely known as leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah, emerged during this period, demonstrating the continuity of networks and ideological frameworks across generations[^77]. This trajectory from Kartosuwiryo's anti-colonial Islamic nationalism to contemporary jihadist terrorism represents one of the most controversial aspects of his legacy, though scholars debate the extent to which he bears responsibility for these later developments that occurred decades after his death.

In post-1998 Indonesia, following the fall of Suharto and the democratic reformation era, reassessments of Kartosuwiryo have become possible. Recently, he and Darul Islam have become heroic symbols of local Islamist struggle for some constituencies, offering an alternative historical vision to the secular nationalist narrative[^78]. Scholarly perspectives have also evolved significantly. While earlier scholarship between 1949 and the 1980s largely rejected the religious claims of the Darul Islam movement, interpreting the antagonism as primarily a fight for power, self-assertion, or land rights, more recent scholars have challenged these interpretations[^79]. Historian Chiara Formichi and others have criticized the failure of earlier scholars like van Dijk and Jackson to take serious consideration of the role of Islam in the movement, arguing that such approaches failed to understand Kartosuwiryo on his own terms[^80].

Contemporary historical inquiry has revealed a more complex figure—neither simply a separatist rebel nor purely a religious martyr, but rather a politician whose legacy has been shaping the role of Islam in Indonesian politics for over fifty years[^81]. The contingencies of the past that transformed a nationalist leader into multiple contested symbols continue to influence debates about Indonesian national identity, the relationship between religion and state, and the legitimacy of different political visions for the nation[^82]. Kartosuwiryo's rebellion contributed to stricter government measures against separatist movements and influenced Indonesia's approach to handling religious and political dissent throughout the subsequent decades[^83].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Recent scholarship, particularly the work of historian Chiara Formichi, has rehabilitated aspects of Kartosuwiryo's historical reputation by taking his Islamic motivations seriously rather than dismissing them as mere pretexts for power struggles or regional grievances[^84]. This revisionist approach argues that Darul Islam was, first and foremost, an Indonesian nationalist and anti-colonial movement dedicated to the full independence of the new nation, with Islam providing the frameworks, ideas, and inspirations for its institutional and ideological development[^85]. From this perspective, Kartosuwiryo represented a legitimate alternative vision of Indonesian statehood that deserved serious consideration rather than dismissal as separatist rebellion.

Supporters and sympathetic scholars emphasize that Kartosuwiryo remained consistent throughout his life in advocating for the implementation of Islamic principles in governance, a position he developed under the tutelage of Tjokroaminoto and maintained through the turbulent decades of colonial resistance and post-independence conflict[^86]. His establishment of schools, courts, and administrative structures within Darul Islam-controlled territories demonstrated a commitment to building functional Islamic governance rather than mere destructive opposition[^87]. His 1936 pamphlet distinguishing between positive jihad (jihad of the tongue and heart, jihad al-akbar led by the Imam) and negative, destructive jihad (jihad of the sword, jihad al-asghar) reveals a more nuanced understanding of Islamic struggle than the crude militant characterization suggests[^88].

The view of Kartosuwiryo as an "intellectual Muslim," as articulated by his grandson, reflects an interpretation that emphasizes his educational background, his prolific writing in Islamic newspapers, his theological studies with traditional religious scholars in Malangbong, and his role as an educator who established madrasas[^89]. This perspective presents him as a religious intellectual who translated Islamic principles into a political program, rather than as a mere military insurgent. His continued resistance against Dutch forces even after the Republican withdrawal from West Java in 1948 can be interpreted as principled anti-colonialism rather than opposition to Indonesian independence itself[^90].

Some analysts argue that the Republican government's rejection of Kartosuwiryo's 1950 proposal to cooperate against communism represented a missed opportunity for national reconciliation and demonstrated the secular nationalist elite's unwillingness to accommodate Islamic political aspirations[^91]. From this viewpoint, the subsequent thirteen years of conflict resulted partly from the rigidity of the Republican leadership rather than solely from Kartosuwiryo's intransigence. The personal dimension of the conflict, particularly Sukarno's reported tears at Kartosuwiryo's execution, suggests recognition even from his opponents of the tragic nature of this fratricidal struggle between former comrades in the independence movement[^92].

### Negative Views

The dominant assessment of Kartosuwiryo in Indonesian historiography and among secular nationalists emphasizes the destructive consequences of his rebellion for national unity and development. Critics argue that his refusal to accept the democratic consensus embodied in the 1945 Constitution and Pancasila ideology represented a fundamental rejection of Indonesia's pluralistic character[^93]. In a nation encompassing extraordinary religious, ethnic, and cultural diversity, his insistence on establishing an Islamic state based on sharia law would have relegated non-Muslims to second-class citizenship and potentially fractured the archipelago into competing religious polities[^94].

The enormous human cost of the Darul Islam rebellion—tens of thousands of deaths over thirteen years—represents its most damning indictment. Scholars like van Dijk have emphasized the frustration of regional military commanders and popular discontent with agrarian reforms and political centralization as primary motivations, suggesting that religious ideology served primarily as mobilizing rhetoric for more mundane grievances[^95]. The escalation to "total war" in 1961 and the increasing use of terror tactics and banditry against civilians undermines claims that the movement represented principled Islamic governance, revealing instead the desperation of a failing insurgency[^96].

Kartosuwiryo's conviction for attempted assassination of President Sukarno, whether historically accurate or not, positioned him in official narratives as not merely a political opponent but as a would-be assassin who sought to destroy the legitimate leadership of the nation[^97]. His execution following a military court-martial was thus presented as appropriate punishment for rebellion and attempted murder rather than as political persecution of an ideological rival. The characterization of Kartosuwiryo as an enemy of the state who rejected the diplomatic and political processes that other Islamic parties like Masyumi had engaged with reinforced this negative assessment[^98].

The connection between Darul Islam and later terrorist organizations, particularly Jemaah Islamiyah, has profoundly colored contemporary negative assessments of Kartosuwiryo's legacy. While he died in 1962, decades before the rise of global jihadism, the organizational networks and ideological frameworks he established provided foundations that later militant Islamists built upon[^99]. The 2002 Bali bombings and other terrorist attacks conducted by groups claiming descent from his movement have associated his name with contemporary religious violence in the minds of many Indonesians and international observers[^100]. Critics argue that even if Kartosuwiryo himself did not advocate the indiscriminate terrorism practiced by his ideological descendants, his uncompromising rejection of secular nationalism and his sanctification of armed jihad established precedents that facilitated later extremism.

Analysts who emphasize material and political motivations over religious ideology argue that Kartosuwiryo's movement exploited religious sentiment to pursue fundamentally secular objectives of power and regional autonomy. This interpretation, dominant in earlier scholarship, characterized the religious rhetoric as instrumental rather than sincere, suggesting that Kartosuwiryo manipulated Islamic symbols to mobilize support for what was essentially a rebellion against central government authority[^101]. While recent scholarship has challenged this reductionist approach, it remains influential in shaping negative assessments of his motivations and legacy.
