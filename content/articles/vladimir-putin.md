## Summary

Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (born October 7, 1952) has dominated Russian politics since 1999, serving as President (2000-2008, 2012-present) and Prime Minister (2008-2012). A former KGB officer, Putin restored authoritarian control after the chaotic 1990s, reasserted Russian power internationally, and presided over economic growth followed by stagnation. His annexation of Crimea (2014) and full-scale invasion of Ukraine (2022) have made him one of the most consequential and controversial world leaders of the 21st century.
