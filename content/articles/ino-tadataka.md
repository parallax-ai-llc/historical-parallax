## Summary

Inō Tadataka created the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques, walking over 35,000 km across Japan over 17 years to complete his measurements. His remarkably accurate maps, completed posthumously in 1821, remained in use until after World War II. He began his surveying career at age 55 after retiring from his family business.
