## Summary

Thura Shwe Mann (born July 11, 1947) is a Myanmar politician and former military general who served as Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw from 2011 to 2016 and chairman of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) from 2013 to 2015.[^1] As a protégé of Senior General Than Shwe, he was considered the third most powerful man in Myanmar's military junta before transitioning to become an unexpected reformer during the country's democratic opening.[^2] His political alliance with Aung San Suu Kyi and efforts to amend the constitution led to his dramatic ouster from the USDP in August 2015, marking one of the most significant political upheavals in Myanmar's transition period.[^3] After founding the Union Betterment Party in 2019, he dissolved it in 2022 following the military coup, effectively ending his formal political career.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Shwe Mann was born on July 11, 1947, in Kanyuntkwin, Bago Division (formerly Pegu Division), Myanmar.[^5] He was born to father Pho Phay and mother Htay Yi, though little is publicly known about his family background or childhood circumstances.[^6] Growing up in the Bago region during the turbulent post-independence period of Myanmar, Shwe Mann came of age during a time when military influence was increasingly shaping the nation's political trajectory.

In 1969, Shwe Mann graduated from the prestigious Defence Services Academy at Pyin Oo Lwin, as part of Intake 11.[^7] This military academy served as the primary training ground for Myanmar's future military elite, and his graduation marked the beginning of what would become a distinguished military career spanning more than three decades. The Defence Services Academy education instilled in him the military discipline and hierarchical values that would shape his approach to both military command and later political leadership.

Shwe Mann is a Burmese Buddhist, and his religious and cultural identity remained important throughout his career, even as he navigated the complex political transformations of Myanmar.[^8] He married Khin Lay Thet, a former high school teacher who was born on June 19, 1947.[^9] Their marriage produced two sons, Aung Thet Mann (also known as Shwe Mann Ko Ko, born June 19, 1977) and Toe Naing Mann (born June 29, 1978).[^10] Both sons would later become prominent businessmen in Myanmar, establishing significant commercial empires during their father's rise to military and political power.

The early military career of Shwe Mann was marked by steady advancement through the ranks. He became a major in 1986 and served as a Regiment Commander in Karen State, where he would earn his most significant military honors.[^11] His formative years in the military coincided with ongoing conflicts between the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) and various ethnic armed groups, particularly in the Karen regions where insurgency had been active since Myanmar's independence.

## Rise to Power

Shwe Mann's ascent to the upper echelons of Myanmar's military hierarchy began in earnest during his campaigns in Karen State. In 1988-1989, he earned the honorific title "Thura" (brave hero) for his military campaign against the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), the armed wing of the Karen National Union.[^12] This campaign led to significant tactical victories, including the eventual capture of the Karen National Union's headquarters in the Manerplaw area, a strategic stronghold that had resisted government forces for decades.[^13]

His military achievements in Karen State in 1994 resulted in his promotion to the rank of brigadier general.[^14] From 1993 to 1995, he served as tactical operations commander for Light Infantry Division (LID) 66 based in Prome (Pyay).[^15] However, his military success came with serious allegations of human rights abuses. A leaked U.S. diplomatic cable stated that "like most Burmese field commanders, Shwe Mann utilized forced civilian porters, including women and children, on a massive scale during operations against Karen insurgents."[^16]

In November 1997, Shwe Mann was promoted to the rank of major general and became a permanent member of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), Myanmar's ruling military junta.[^17] This appointment placed him among the most powerful military leaders in the country. His continued advancement reflected not only his military accomplishments but also his growing relationship with Senior General Than Shwe, who would become his mentor and patron.

In 2003, Shwe Mann became Chief of General Staff of the Armed Services with the rank of general.[^18] As Than Shwe's protégé, he was positioned as the third most powerful man in the SPDC, which ruled Myanmar until 2011.[^19] His closeness to Than Shwe was crucial to his political survival and advancement, though it also meant he was implicated in some of the junta's most controversial actions.

Allegations emerged that Shwe Mann was directly involved in the 2003 Depayin massacre, in which at least 70 people associated with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were killed by a government-sponsored mob.[^20] According to some accounts, Than Shwe ordered lower-ranking officers to carry out the attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's convoy at Depayin, bypassing his deputy and leaving Shwe Mann directly responsible for the military preparation of the attack.[^21] These allegations have never been proven in court, but they cast a long shadow over his military legacy.

During the 2007 Saffron Revolution, when Buddhist monks led massive pro-democracy protests, Shwe Mann was allegedly involved in the brutal crackdown that followed.[^22] According to a 2007 U.S. diplomatic cable, "by all accounts he willingly participated in the brutal repression of September's pro-democracy protests."[^23] The military's response killed and detained many more people than officially admitted, and Shwe Mann's role in this repression led to his placement on U.S. and EU sanction lists.[^24]

In the 2010 general election, Myanmar's first in two decades, Shwe Mann ran for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) in the constituency of Zeyathiri Township in the Union Territory of Naypyidaw.[^25] He won his seat and was subsequently elected Speaker of the Lower House at the first regular session of the Pyithu Hluttaw in 2011, marking his transition from military general to civilian politician.[^26]

---

## Major Achievements

As Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw from January 31, 2011, to January 29, 2016, Shwe Mann played a transformative role in Myanmar's democratic transition.[^27] He single-handedly helped grow parliament's authority relative to the executive branch, which would emerge as an important foundation for a stable democratic system in Myanmar.[^28] This institutional strengthening represented a significant shift in a country where the military and executive had traditionally dominated all political processes.

In May 2013, Shwe Mann replaced President Thein Sein as chairman of the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, consolidating his position as one of Myanmar's most powerful political figures.[^29] Although he didn't command the celebrity status of Aung San Suu Kyi and lacked the international prestige of Thein Sein, Shwe Mann gained a reputation as a reformer and a person who could bring disparate sides together.[^30] He firmly supported liberal reforms and the turn towards a market economy, and was critical of Thein Sein's "sluggish" approach to liberalization.[^31]

One of Shwe Mann's most remarkable achievements was cultivating a working relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi after her election in the 2012 by-elections.[^32] Between August 2012 and August 2015, they held 36 closed-door meetings, though Shwe Mann refused to disclose what was discussed to his fellow USDP members.[^33] This cooperation was unprecedented in Myanmar's political landscape, representing an alliance between a former military general and the pro-democracy icon. Despite their opposite political standpoints, their relationship has been defined as "excellent" or at minimum "a working relationship, albeit perhaps one of convenience."[^34]

Shwe Mann championed constitutional reform efforts that would have limited military power in Myanmar's political system. He openly tried to amend section 60(c) of the constitution, which would have required the military's presidential nominee to contest elections and win a seat, likely under the USDP umbrella.[^35] In June 2015, he supported a constitutional amendment to limit the military's power, a bill that failed to pass Parliament but was backed by Aung San Suu Kyi.[^36] Among other reform promises, Shwe Mann had pledged to amend the constitution to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to be elected president, as she was constitutionally barred due to her marriage to a foreign national and having children with foreign citizenship.[^37]

On February 7, 2012, Shwe Mann addressed the Pyithu Hluttaw and acknowledged the longstanding issue of corruption in all levels of the government sector, demonstrating a willingness to confront sensitive topics that previous military leaders had avoided.[^38] He was seen as a staunch critic of corrupt practices amongst public officials and had reportedly ordered action against corrupt authorities as far back as 2005.[^39]

Under his leadership, the Parliamentary Constitutional Amendment Implementation Committee discussed possible reforms in accordance with instructions provided by Parliament.[^40] The proposed amendments were designed to strengthen the role of the legislature at the Union level and devolve authority to State and Region Governments, representing a significant decentralization of power.[^41] These reform efforts, while ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrated Shwe Mann's willingness to challenge the military's political dominance.

In September 2012, Shwe Mann was removed from the U.S. sanction list because he had "taken concrete steps to promote political reforms and human rights, and to move Burma away from repression and dictatorship toward democracy and freedom."[^42] This international recognition of his reformist credentials marked a dramatic reversal from his earlier designation as a human rights violator.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his later reputation as a reformer, Shwe Mann's career was marked by serious allegations of human rights abuses and corruption. His military campaigns against ethnic minorities, particularly in Karen State, involved systematic use of forced labor. According to leaked U.S. diplomatic cables, he "utilized forced civilian porters, including women and children, on a massive scale during operations against Karen insurgents."[^43] These practices constituted serious violations of international humanitarian law and caused immense suffering among civilian populations.

The allegation that Shwe Mann was directly involved in planning the 2003 Depayin massacre represents one of the most serious charges against him.[^44] The attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's motorcade, in which at least 70 NLD supporters were clubbed to death by regime-backed thugs, was a watershed moment in Myanmar's repression of the pro-democracy movement.[^45] While these allegations have never been proven in court, multiple sources indicate Shwe Mann was allegedly responsible for military preparations for the attack as ordered by Than Shwe.[^46]

His role in the 2007 Saffron Revolution crackdown further damaged his human rights record. A U.S. diplomatic cable stated that "by all accounts he willingly participated in the brutal repression of September's pro-democracy protests," when government forces violently suppressed monk-led demonstrations.[^47] The crackdown resulted in numerous deaths and detentions, and cemented Myanmar's status as one of the world's most repressive regimes.

While Shwe Mann may not be as notoriously corrupt as some colleagues, he had solid connections to regime business cronies, reportedly serving as a director in Tay Za's Htoo Construction Company, and allegedly being involved in fertilizer, brokerage, and fish export businesses.[^48] Critics expressed concerns about "the man who used his power to build a family business empire and who quickly became rich."[^49]

His sons' business activities became a particular source of controversy. Aung Thet Mann's company, Ayer Shwe Wah, received lucrative government contracts to supply fertilizers to farmers throughout the Irrawaddy Delta region when his father was regional commander.[^50] In 2001, the regime gave Ayer Shwe Wah more than 30,000 acres of wetlands and rice paddy in the delta region, and in 2005, it became the first private company to receive permission to export rice to Bangladesh and Singapore.[^51] Toe Naing Mann and Aung Thet Mann co-owned Red Link Communications, one of the country's few wireless providers.[^52] The U.S. placed Aung Thet Mann's company on the sanctions list in 2008 as part of broader sanctions against regime-connected individuals.[^53]

Critics alleged that his sons "used their father's political clout to advance their business interests."[^54] However, notably, there were no formal charges of corruption or abuse of power filed against Shwe Mann related to these family business interests.[^55] His wife, Khin Lay Thet, was also named among spouses of senior Burmese government officials who faced U.S. Treasury sanctions.[^56]

The dramatic circumstances of Shwe Mann's ouster from the USDP chairmanship in August 2015 revealed deep tensions within Myanmar's political and military establishment. On August 13, 2015, amidst reports of tensions between himself and President Thein Sein, Shwe Mann was unexpectedly removed from his post as Chairman of the USDP and replaced by Htay Oo.[^57] The pressures boiled over after an August 12 meeting to finalize the USDP candidate list when Shwe Mann accepted only 50 of the 150 newly retired military officers whom the commander-in-chief had asked to be included as USDP candidates.[^58] The military trusted Thein Sein more than Shwe Mann, who they believed may have become too much of a reformer and could, as president, possibly weaken the military further.[^59]

Shwe Mann's willingness to align with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD was seen as a betrayal by military hardliners. He was detained and forcefully purged from the USDP for working with Suu Kyi's NLD, demonstrating the limits of Myanmar's democratic transition.[^60] An opinion piece in The Irrawaddy titled "For U Shwe Mann, Enemies Lurk Everywhere" captured the precarious nature of his political position, caught between reformers and military conservatives.[^61]

## Personal Life

Shwe Mann married Khin Lay Thet, a former high school teacher born on June 19, 1947.[^62] Khin Lay Thet was recorded in a 2007 U.S. cable as a member of the Panel of Patrons and one of four vice presidents of the Myanmar Women's Affairs Federation, indicating her involvement in regime-affiliated women's organizations.[^63] She was named among spouses of senior Burmese government officials who faced U.S. Treasury sanctions during the military junta period.[^64]

The couple had two sons who became prominent business figures in Myanmar. Aung Thet Mann (also known as Shwe Mann Ko Ko), born June 19, 1977, became CEO of Ayer Shwe Wah, a major Burmese company involved in construction, palm oil production, and import and export of chemical fertilizers and agricultural products.[^65] Toe Naing Mann, born June 29, 1978, founded Red Link Communications, a major telecommunications group.[^66] Both sons built extensive business empires spanning telecommunications, agriculture, natural gas, restaurants, property, and other sectors, and are considered among Myanmar's wealthiest people.[^67]

The family connections extended through strategic marriages. In 2004, Toe Naing Mann married Zay Zin Latt, daughter of Khin Shwe, president of Zaykabar Company and one of Myanmar's most prominent business tycoons.[^68] Aung Thet Mann married Khin Hnin Thandar.[^69] These marriage alliances connected the Shwe Mann family to some of Myanmar's most powerful business networks, creating a web of political and economic influence.

Shwe Mann maintained his Buddhist faith throughout his life, and his religious identity was an important aspect of his personal and public persona in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar.[^70] Despite his powerful position, he cultivated an image as someone who could bridge different communities and political factions, a skill that served him well during the tumultuous transition period.

His relationship with his mentor, Senior General Than Shwe, remained significant even after Than Shwe's retirement in 2011.[^71] When Aung San Suu Kyi requested a meeting with Than Shwe after the NLD's landslide victory in 2015, Shwe Mann visited his former mentor twice to arrange the meeting and accompanied Suu Kyi to Than Shwe's residence.[^72] This demonstrated that despite political changes, traditional hierarchical relationships and personal loyalties remained important in Myanmar's political culture.

After the 2021 military coup, Shwe Mann was known to have close ties to Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained in junta custody since the coup.[^73] In his later years, health issues became a concern. When he dissolved the Union Betterment Party in October 2022, the stated reason was that "the leaders are now becoming too old to lead the party, and some are suffering from various health ailments while others are facing miscellaneous problems."[^74]

## Legacy

Shwe Mann's legacy in Myanmar politics remains complex and contested. He represents a unique figure in Myanmar's modern history: a former military general who participated in authoritarian repression but later became an advocate for democratic reform and parliamentary strengthening. His transformation from Than Shwe's protégé and the third most powerful man in the military junta to a reformist politician working with Aung San Suu Kyi represents one of the most dramatic political evolutions in Myanmar's transition period.[^75]

His most enduring contribution may be his role in strengthening Myanmar's parliament as an institution. By helping grow parliament's authority relative to the executive branch, Shwe Mann laid groundwork that would emerge as an important foundation for democratic governance.[^76] This institutional development represented a significant shift in a country where military and executive dominance had been the norm for decades. His work on constitutional reform, though ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrated that change from within the establishment was possible.

The alliance between Shwe Mann and Aung San Suu Kyi stands as one of the most remarkable political developments in Myanmar's history. Their 36 closed-door meetings between 2012 and 2015 represented an unprecedented bridge between the military establishment and the pro-democracy movement.[^77] While their cooperation was likely motivated by mutual political interest—Shwe Mann seeking presidential ambitions and Suu Kyi seeking constitutional reform—it nonetheless paved the way for political dialogue that had been impossible during the junta years.

His dramatic ouster from the USDP chairmanship in August 2015 exposed the fragility of Myanmar's democratic transition and the military's determination to protect its political prerogatives.[^78] The purge demonstrated that there were clear limits to how far military leaders would tolerate reform, particularly when it threatened their constitutional privileges. This event foreshadowed the challenges that would ultimately culminate in the 2021 military coup, suggesting that Myanmar's democratic opening was always constrained by military redlines.

After his 2015 electoral defeat in his hometown constituency of Phyu to NLD candidate Than Nyunt, Shwe Mann's political influence waned significantly.[^79] However, Aung San Suu Kyi rewarded his cooperation by appointing him chairman of the Legal Affairs and Special Cases Assessment Commission in February 2016, a position with significant influence over legislative reform.[^80] When the NLD-dominated parliament voted not to renew the commission's mandate in February 2019, shortly after Shwe Mann announced formation of the Union Betterment Party, it signaled the end of their political alliance.[^81]

The formation and subsequent dissolution of the Union Betterment Party encapsulated the final chapter of Shwe Mann's political career. Founded in April 2019 with objectives including building a democratic federal union and establishing rule of law, the party represented his attempt to maintain political relevance outside the USDP.[^82] However, the party failed to gain significant traction, and after the February 2021 military coup, Shwe Mann maintained public silence about the military's seizure of power.[^83] His dissolution of the UBP in October 2022, citing age and health issues, effectively ended his formal political involvement, though party members' concerns about safety and being "misunderstood" suggested the difficult post-coup environment influenced this decision.[^84]

In his 2018 book "The Lady, I and Affairs of State," Shwe Mann wrote of his conviction that "as the people are the rightful owner of sovereign power of the State, regardless of whoever might have taken it under any circumstance, it should be returned to the people."[^85] This philosophical statement, coming from a former military general who had served the junta for decades, reflected his evolving political consciousness and his complex position in Myanmar's history.

Analysts note that Shwe Mann became a credible presidential candidate by gaining a reputation as a reformer and a person who could bring disparate sides together.[^86] While his presidential ambitions were never realized, his role in Myanmar's democratic transition period—however brief and ultimately unsuccessful—demonstrated that political transformation was possible even among the military elite. His removal from U.S. sanctions in 2012 for taking "concrete steps to promote political reforms" represented international recognition of his changed role.[^87]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and some analysts view Shwe Mann as a genuine reformer who took significant political risks to advance Myanmar's democratic transition. The Brookings Institution argued that while "Shwe Mann's decisions were undoubtedly impacted by his interest in building a broad coalition that would support his presidential ambitions, they also paved the way for a more democratic system of governance."[^88] This assessment recognizes that even self-interested political behavior can produce beneficial institutional outcomes.

His removal from U.S. sanctions in September 2012 reflected international recognition that he had "taken concrete steps to promote political reforms and human rights, and to move Burma away from repression and dictatorship toward democracy and freedom."[^89] This official U.S. government assessment acknowledged measurable changes in his political behavior and impact, representing a significant reversal from his earlier designation as a human rights violator.

Shwe Mann's role in strengthening parliamentary institutions is viewed positively by democracy advocates. Brookings noted that he "single-handedly helped grow parliament's authority relative to the executive, which may emerge as an important foundation for a stable democratic system in Myanmar."[^90] This institutional legacy represented a significant contribution to Myanmar's nascent democratic structures, even as those structures later proved insufficient to prevent military backsliding.

His willingness to work with Aung San Suu Kyi demonstrated political courage, particularly given the risks it posed to his position within the military establishment. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted that he "gained a reputation as a reformer and a person who can bring disparate sides together," highlighting his role as a bridge-builder during a critical transitional period.[^91] His 36 meetings with Suu Kyi between 2012 and 2015 represented unprecedented dialogue between former adversaries.

Defenders point to his public acknowledgment of government corruption in his February 2012 parliamentary address as evidence of his willingness to confront difficult issues.[^92] His reputation as "a staunch critic of corrupt practices amongst public officials" who had "ordered action against corrupt authorities as far back as 2005" suggested genuine commitment to anti-corruption efforts, even while serving in the military junta.[^93]

The Stimson Center's analysis suggested that his ouster from the USDP was precisely because of his reformist credentials, noting that "Shwe Mann's willingness to turn from the interests of the military and USDP elites was the primary reason for Shwe Mann's ouster."[^94] This interpretation frames his political downfall as evidence of his genuine commitment to reform rather than mere opportunism.

### Negative Views

Critics view Shwe Mann as an opportunist whose reformist credentials were primarily motivated by presidential ambitions rather than genuine democratic commitment. His extensive involvement in human rights abuses during his military career—including the use of forced labor, involvement in the Depayin massacre, and participation in the Saffron Revolution crackdown—fundamentally undermines claims that he underwent a sincere transformation.[^95]

The allegations that he was directly involved in planning the 2003 Depayin massacre, in which at least 70 NLD supporters were killed, cast a particularly dark shadow over his legacy.[^96] Critics argue that no amount of later reformist behavior can erase responsibility for such serious human rights violations. His role in the 2007 Saffron Revolution crackdown, where he "willingly participated in the brutal repression" of pro-democracy protesters, further establishes a pattern of authoritarian violence.[^97]

Skeptics point to his family's business empire as evidence that his political positions were designed to protect and expand personal wealth rather than advance democratic principles. His sons' companies received lucrative government contracts during his tenure as a senior military officer, and critics allege they "used their father's political clout to advance their business interests."[^98] The fact that Aung Thet Mann's company received over 30,000 acres of land from the regime and became the first private company permitted to export rice suggests systematic corruption.[^99]

An opinion piece in The Irrawaddy questioned his political motivations, noting that "critics have had concerns about the man who used his power to build a family business empire and who quickly became rich."[^100] While no formal corruption charges were filed, the pattern of family enrichment during his military career raises questions about whether his later reformist stance was genuine or merely a strategy to maintain power and wealth during political transition.

His silence following the 2021 military coup and his dissolution of the Union Betterment Party in 2022 raised questions about his commitment to democracy when it became politically risky.[^101] Critics argue that a genuine democrat would have spoken out against the coup, rather than quietly withdrawing from politics. The stated reasons for dissolving the party—age and health issues—struck some observers as convenient excuses, while party members' concerns about safety suggested fear of the military regime.[^102]

Some analysts view his alliance with Aung San Suu Kyi as purely transactional, designed to position himself for the presidency by appearing moderate and reformist.[^103] The fact that their alliance ended when it became politically inconvenient—with the NLD-dominated parliament dissolving his commission shortly after he formed a competing political party—suggests the relationship was based on mutual political interest rather than shared democratic values.[^104]

The Irrawaddy's commentary titled "For U Shwe Mann, Enemies Lurk Everywhere" captured skepticism about his political positioning, suggesting he was unable to find a stable political identity, trusted neither by military hardliners nor by genuine democracy advocates.[^105] This interpretation views him as a political chameleon whose shifting allegiances reflected opportunism rather than principle.
