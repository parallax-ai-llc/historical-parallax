## Summary

Emperor Gojong (1852-1919) was the 26th monarch of the Joseon Dynasty and the first emperor of the Korean Empire, ruling Korea for 43 years from 1864 to 1907.[^1] Born as Yi Myeongbok, he ascended the throne at age twelve and witnessed Korea's turbulent transition from traditional kingdom to modern empire amid intense foreign pressure.[^2] His reign was marked by ambitious modernization efforts, the proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897, and ultimately tragic failure as Korea fell under Japanese control.[^3] Despite his efforts to preserve Korean sovereignty through diplomatic maneuvering and reform, he was forced to abdicate in 1907 and died under suspicious circumstances in 1919, with his death sparking the March First Independence Movement.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Gojong was born on September 8, 1852, with the personal name Yi Myeongbok, the second son of Yi Ha-eung (Grand Internal Prince Heungseon, later known as the Daewongun) and his wife from the Yeoheung Min clan.[^5] He was born at a private residence in Heungseon-gun, Gureumjae-dong, into the ruling House of Yi, though his family occupied a peripheral position in the royal hierarchy.[^6] His father descended from King Injo through Prince Sado's line but lacked direct succession claims, living outside the main palace until political circumstances dramatically changed their fortunes.[^7]

His childhood names were 'Gaetdongi' (later 'Gaetong') and 'Myeongbok', with his first formal names being 'Jaehwang' and his surnames 'Hyeong' and 'Hee'.[^8] According to historical accounts, when Gojong was young, he lived like any other child of his age, with nothing particularly special to distinguish him from other aristocratic children.[^9] Despite his family's lack of direct power, they were still part of the prestigious Jeonju Lee clan and held positions within the royal family structure, making them clearly upper class by the standards of the Joseon Dynasty.[^10]

Prior to his unexpected ascension at age eleven, Gojong underwent traditional palace education focused on Confucian scholarship, including the Four Books and Five Classics, historical annals, poetry composition, and moral philosophy.[^11] He was tutored by scholars adhering to Joseon's Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, and this curriculum prioritized rote memorization, ethical governance, and filial piety to prepare elites for bureaucratic administration.[^12] As a royal, however, Gojong's studies bypassed formal civil service testing that commoners would need to undertake.[^13]

The young prince's life changed forever in 1863 when King Cheoljong died without leaving a male heir.[^14] Political circumstances led to the selection of the twelve-year-old Yi Myeongbok to ascend the Korean throne on December 13, 1863, at Changdeokgung Palace.[^15] His biological father, the Heungseon Daewongun, was granted the title equivalent to "regent" and acted as the de facto ruler of the country until Gojong reached the age of majority, though in practice the Daewongun continued holding substantial power until 1874.[^16]

## Rise to Power

When Gojong first ascended the throne at age twelve, he was merely a figurehead while his father, the Daewongun, wielded real authority.[^17] Queen Sinjeong, the dowager queen, invited the Daewongun to assist his son in ruling the country, and though she remained the titular regent, the Daewongun exercised the powers of the regency in her name.[^18] During the regency period from 1863 to 1873, the Daewongun exerted strong influence on every aspect of Joseon society, from politics to diplomacy to religion and art.[^19]

The Daewongun pursued a policy of strict isolationism for Joseon, rejecting all offers of trade from other countries and ordering the persecution and execution of Catholic missionaries.[^20] This isolationist stance led to several violent confrontations with foreign powers. In 1866, the French conducted a punitive campaign in Korea (the French Campaign against Korea) lasting from October 11 to November 22, but eventually retreated without achieving concessions.[^21] Similarly, in 1871, the United States launched the American Expedition to Korea (Shinmiyangyo), which also failed to force Korea to open its ports.[^22]

A turning point came in 1866 when Gojong married Min Ja-yeong (later known as Queen Min or Empress Myeongseong) at the age of fourteen.[^23] She was of aristocratic background and was chosen by the Daewongun himself to marry his son.[^24] Initially, the marriage faced significant challenges. On the day of their marriage ceremony, Gojong did not go to his wife's quarters to consummate the marriage, but instead went to the quarters of his concubine, Royal Consort Yi Gwi-in of the Gyeongju Yi clan.[^25] The young queen spent her lonely nights reading history, philosophy, religion, and politics, educating herself in subjects usually reserved for aristocratic men.[^26]

Over time, however, King Gojong eventually recognized Queen Min's intelligence and began to form a close relationship with her.[^27] As Gojong's relationship with Queen Min grew closer, his relationship with his father, the Daewongun, became increasingly distant.[^28] In 1873, Gojong announced his assumption of direct royal rule, marking the end of his father's regency and the beginning of his independent reign.[^29] This transition represented not just a shift in formal authority but a fundamental reorientation of Korean policy, as Queen Min and her family gained influence at court and Korea began to move away from strict isolationism.[^30]

The couple faced considerable tragedy with their children, suffering multiple child losses with only one son, Sunjong (born 1874), surviving to adulthood to become the last king of Korea (r. 1907–1910).[^31] Queen Min's first child, Wnja, died only five days after birth in 1871.[^32] These personal losses deepened the bond between Gojong and his queen, who became his closest political advisor and ally in the coming struggles to modernize and defend Korea.[^33]

## Major Achievements

### The Treaty of Ganghwa and Opening of Korea (1876)

In 1876, following the Ganghwa Island Incident of 1875 when Japanese gunboats surveyed Korean waters and exchanged fire with Korean forts, Japan employed gunboat diplomacy to force Korea to sign the Treaty of Ganghwa.[^34] While this treaty opened Korea to foreign trade and marked the end of its isolationist policy, it was an unequal treaty that gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea and forced the government to open three ports: Busan, Incheon, and Wonsan.[^35] Despite its unequal nature, the treaty began Korea's engagement with the modern international system.[^36]

### Modernization Efforts Under Queen Min's Influence (1882-1894)

In early 1881, King Gojong set up an Office for the Management of State Affairs (T'ongni Kimu Amun), modeled on a similar institution created in China to deal with foreign affairs and military modernization.[^37] He also created a Special Skills Force of eighty cadets to learn modern warfare under a Japanese army lieutenant.[^38] In July 1881, a policy of enlightenment and progress was officially proclaimed.[^39]

As part of the modernization plan, King Gojong invited Japanese military attaché Lieutenant Horimoto Reizō in 1881 to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army called the byeolgigun, equipped with rifles and modern training.[^40] However, this modernization created tensions with the traditional army, which had not received pay for thirteen months and was being neglected in favor of the new force.[^41] These tensions exploded in the Imo Incident of 1882, when unpaid soldiers who found sand and bad rice in their rations launched a violent uprising.[^42]

Despite this setback, Gojong continued his modernization efforts. In 1882, he signed the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navigation with the United States, Korea's first treaty with a Western nation, hoping to gain American protection from the imperial designs of neighbors Japan, China, and Russia.[^43]

### Proclamation of the Korean Empire (1897)

After the traumatic assassination of Queen Min by Japanese agents in 1895 and his subsequent flight to the Russian legation in February 1896, Gojong took a bold step to assert Korean sovereignty.[^44] On October 11, 1897, he proclaimed the Korean Empire and was crowned emperor at the religious shrine Hwangudan in Seoul.[^45] He elevated himself from king to emperor and changed the name of the country from Joseon to Daehan ("Great Han"), actions symbolic of his independence from China.[^46] He posthumously elevated Queen Min to the status of Empress Myeongseong the Great.[^47]

As Gojong himself stated, according to royal counsel Kim Yeong Su: "Being crowned the king was the will of the Heavens, but becoming emperor was the will of my people."[^48] This proclamation represented Korea's assertion of equal status with China and Japan in the international hierarchy.[^49]

### The Gwangmu Reform (1897-1905)

Following the proclamation of the Korean Empire, Emperor Gojong initiated the Gwangmu Reform, a comprehensive modernization and westernization program affecting Korea's military, economy, land system, education system, and various industries.[^50] The reforms effected a separation of the national and royal household, established a ministry of finance responsible for tax collection, and created an independent judiciary and police system.[^51]

One of the most significant social reforms was the complete abolition of the slave (nobi) system in 1894, which had existed since the Gojoseon period.[^52] The reforms also gave nobles and commoners equal legal status, ending the social status system that had separated them for centuries.[^53]

### Infrastructure and Industrial Development

Gojong showed particular interest in implementing modern infrastructure in Korea. In 1898, he wholly invested in founding the Hanseong Electric Company, which completed its first power plant at Dongdaemun in 1899.[^54] By the end of that year, the company had launched streetcar service and turned on electric lights on Seoul's Jongno Street.[^55] Basic industries such as electricity, telegraphy, and trams were introduced during this period.[^56]

The Gyeongin Line, Korea's inaugural railway connecting Seoul to Incheon, underwent construction from 1897 and officially opened on September 18, 1899, spanning approximately 27 kilometers.[^57] In 1902, six years after the first introduction of the telephone in Korea, the first long-distance public phone was installed.[^58] Maps from around 1905 illustrate the expanding network of railways, telegram lines, telephone lines, post offices, and waterways across Korea.[^59]

These modernization efforts represented Korea's ambitious attempt to strengthen itself against foreign domination and laid the fundamental background for future Korean development in infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of modern bureaucracy and military.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Weak Leadership and Over-Reliance on Foreign Powers

Gojong faced substantial criticism for his weak leadership and dependence on foreign powers to protect Korea.[^61] He believed that relying on stronger powers was the best solution when Korea had neither army to guard itself nor sufficient financial resources, but these decisions were made without taking full responsibility, ultimately harming the very nation he intended to save.[^62] By attaching Korea's fate to China's protection during much of his early reign, Korea became dependent on a declining power, which limited the country's contact with the outside world, hindered reform efforts, and contributed to Korea's lack of preparedness for the challenges it faced.[^63]

### Military and Financial Mismanagement

King Gojong's military reforms created severe internal tensions. He began to rely on the new paid army (byeolgigun) equipped with rifles while the old army had not received salary for 13 months.[^64] When the traditional army was finally paid just one month's salary, they were enraged and sparked the Imo Incident riot of 1882, during which the Daewongun briefly seized power again.[^65] The trigger for this riot was the discovery of sand and bad rice in soldiers' rations, revealing serious corruption and mismanagement in military administration.[^66]

### The Donghak Rebellion and Foreign Intervention (1894)

When the Donghak Peasant Revolution erupted in 1894 as an anti-government, anti-yangban, and anti-foreign campaign, Gojong's handling of the crisis proved disastrous.[^67] Threatened with defeat by the Donghak forces, King Gojong requested Chinese troops to assist in suppressing the rebellion in late May 1894.[^68] In June 1894, the Qing government sent 2,800 troops at the Korean emperor's request.[^69]

This decision had catastrophic geopolitical consequences. Japan considered the Chinese intervention a violation of the 1885 Convention of Tientsin and sent an expeditionary force of 8,000 troops, which landed at Incheon.[^70] Japan then occupied Gyeongbokgung Palace on June 21, 1894, and forced King Gojong to establish a new cabinet, effectively placing Korea under Japanese influence.[^71] Gojong's request for Chinese intervention gave Japan the pretext to send its own troops, triggering the First Sino-Japanese War, which was fought largely on Korean soil.[^72]

### Court Corruption and Nepotism

Following the Daewongun's removal from power, Gojong's wife Queen Min and her family gained full control of the court and placed their family members in important government positions.[^73] This nepotism created resentment and factionalism within the Korean government. When the Daewongun was kidnapped and taken to China in 1882, power passed fully to Queen Min, who initially opposed many modernization efforts.[^74]

### Failure to Prevent Japanese Takeover

Despite Gojong's domestic and foreign policies showing initial success as he played the rival Russian, Japanese, and Chinese sides off each other to prevent total foreign control, his strategies ultimately failed.[^75] During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, Japan invaded Korea and forced the emperor to sign a treaty allowing the Japanese to use the country as a military base and to place advisers in the government.[^76]

In 1905, the Eulsa Treaty made Korea a protectorate of Imperial Japan, depriving it of diplomatic sovereignty.[^77] Emperor Gojong was opposed to the treaty, but Itō Hirobumi ordered Japanese troops to encircle the Korean imperial palace.[^78] Gojong and Itō argued for over three hours, with Gojong questioning whether signing the agreement would reduce Korea's status to that of colonized African nations.[^79] Despite his refusal and that of Prime Minister Han Gyu-seol to sign, Itō pressured the cabinet with threats of bodily harm, and the treaty was signed without the emperor's approval.[^80]

### The Failed Hague Mission (1907)

In June 1907, Emperor Gojong attempted a desperate diplomatic gambit by sending three secret emissaries—Yi Tjoune, Yi Sang-seol, and Yi Wi-jong—to the Second Hague Peace Convention to declare the invalidity of the 1905 Eulsa Treaty and assert Korea's independence.[^81] However, the mission failed completely. The nations at The Hague did not allow the emissaries to take part in the conference, as Korea was no longer viewed as an independent nation since Japan had assumed responsibility for its international representation.[^82]

When news of the envoys reached Japan, the consequences were swift and severe. On the night of July 18, 1907, Japanese Foreign Minister Tadasu Hayashi arrived in Seoul and forced Gojong to abdicate in favor of his son, Crown Prince Sunjong.[^83] This marked the effective end of Gojong's political life and Korean sovereignty.[^84]

## Personal Life

### Marriage to Queen Min (Empress Myeongseong)

On March 21, 1866, fourteen-year-old Min Ja-yeong married King Gojong, becoming Queen of Korea.[^85] She was Gojong's first cousin, as her uncle was the Daewongun.[^86] The marriage was arranged by the Daewongun, who selected her from aristocratic candidates.[^87] The relationship began poorly, with Gojong initially neglecting Queen Min for his concubines on their wedding night and thereafter.[^88]

During her lonely early years, Queen Min spent her time reading books written in Chinese characters—an education usually reserved for aristocratic men—furthering her knowledge in history, science, politics, philosophy, and religion.[^89] Her intelligence and learning eventually caught King Gojong's attention, and they became closer with age, developing into genuine political partners.[^90] Their bond deepened through shared tragedy, as they suffered multiple child losses, with only their son Sunjong (born 1874) surviving to adulthood.[^91]

### The Assassination of Queen Min

On October 8, 1895, one of the most traumatic events of Gojong's life occurred when Japanese Minister to Korea Miura Gorō directly ordered the assassination of Queen Min.[^92] Miura backed the faction headed by the Daewongun and organized a coordinated attack. The Hullyeondae Regiment loyal to the Daewongun attacked Gyeongbokgung Palace, overpowered its Royal Guards, and allowed a group of ronin (Japanese mercenaries specifically recruited for this purpose) to assassinate the queen consort.[^93]

The Japanese pressured King Gojong to posthumously strip her royal titles, but Gojong adamantly refused.[^94] When he later declared Korea to be the Korean Empire, he elevated her to the status of Empress and gave her the posthumous name of Empress Myeongseong the Great.[^95] The possibility exists that Gojong suspected his father, the Daewongun, of being involved with the Japanese-backed assassination, which contributed to their complete estrangement.[^96]

### Relationship with His Father

The relationship between King Gojong and his father, the Daewongun, was characterized by initial dependence during Gojong's youth, followed by growing tensions as Gojong matured and came under Queen Min's influence.[^97] Even though the Daewongun had no legal rights to maintain the regency after Gojong came of age, he still attempted to act as regent illegally at various points.[^98] 

When the Daewongun died in 1898, Emperor Gwangmu (Gojong's imperial title) refused to attend his father's funeral because of their poor relationship.[^99] However, it was also reported that the emperor's cries could be heard when he looked over the palace wall, suggesting complex emotions of filial duty, grief, and resentment.[^100]

### Asylum in the Russian Legation

Following Queen Min's assassination and fearing for his own safety, King Gojong took the dramatic step of fleeing his own palace. At dawn on February 11, 1896, two covered sedan chairs entered the Russian legation in Seoul, carrying King Gojong and his heir Crown Prince Sunjong, both dressed as female attendants to avoid detection.[^101] They remained in the Russian legation for about one year until February 20, 1897, governing Korea from this foreign sanctuary.[^102]

During this period, Gojong's relationship with Russia deepened considerably. While some have suggested that King Gojong first encountered coffee while living in the Russian legation, coffee had actually been known in Korean palaces since the mid-1880s.[^103] However, he likely acquired his lasting taste for the drink during this period, with some sources indicating that German architect Georg de Lalande Sontag introduced the king to the art of coffee drinking.[^104] The asylum resulted in a temporary decline of Japan's influence in Korea and a corresponding rise in Russia's influence.[^105]

### Personality and Character

Historical sources describe Gojong as genuinely committed to preserving Korean sovereignty and modernizing the nation, though ultimately ineffective in achieving these goals.[^106] He demonstrated intellectual curiosity, as evidenced by his personal investment in modern technologies like electricity and his interest in Western innovations.[^107] However, he also showed indecisiveness and over-reliance on advisors and foreign powers rather than developing Korea's independent strength.[^108] His tendency to play great powers against each other showed political sophistication but ultimately proved insufficient against determined Japanese imperialism.[^109]

## Legacy

### Death and Suspicious Circumstances

Emperor Gojong died on January 21, 1919, at Deoksugung Palace at age 66.[^110] The official cause of death was listed as cerebral hemorrhage, but the circumstances were and remain deeply suspicious to Koreans.[^111] Rumors persisted that Gojong had been poisoned by Japan, and most Koreans blamed the Japanese for his death because he refused to sign an oath opposing Korean independence.[^112]

Several pieces of evidence fueled the poisoning conspiracy. Attendants preparing Gojong's corpse found that his clothing had to be cut off due to grotesquely swollen limbs, his teeth had fallen out of their sockets, and there was a black mark extending from his throat to his stomach.[^113] An official claimed the ex-emperor died about an hour after drinking sweet rice wine, gripped with severe stomach pains that left him paralyzed.[^114] Princess Masako, a daughter-in-law of Gojong, testified in her autobiography that Japanese government officials gave a secret instruction to poison him.[^115] Additionally, Kuratomi Yuzaburo's diary allegedly contains evidence that Japanese Governor-General Terauchi Masatake and General Hasegawa Yoshimichi may have been behind the crime.[^116]

The Japanese authorities never investigated the cause of Gojong's sudden death, which remains officially a mystery.[^117]

### Catalyst for the March First Movement

Gojong's death became a direct catalyst for the March First Movement of 1919, which in turn bolstered the Korean independence movement.[^118] The death of the emperor, a strong supporter of Korean independence, brought many mourners to Seoul for the funeral scheduled for March 3rd.[^119] Independence organizers decided to schedule their protest for March 1, capitalizing on the significant number of people congregating in Seoul, disguising their organizing efforts as funeral preparations.[^120]

The March First Movement began on March 1, 1919, and consisted of a series of protests against Japanese colonial rule held throughout Korea and internationally by the Korean diaspora, with protests largely concentrated in March and April of that year.[^121] Immediately after Gojong's death, rumors circulated widely that he had been poisoned by the Japanese, and wall posters to that effect appeared throughout Seoul, inflaming anti-Japanese sentiment.[^122]

### Impact on Korean Modernization

Although Gojong's modernization efforts were ultimately cut short by Japanese occupation in 1910, they planted in the minds of Koreans the courage and pride to maintain their culture throughout the brutal occupation period.[^123] The Gwangmu Reform created the fundamental background for future Korean development in infrastructure, economy, and modern bureaucracy and military structures.[^124] Korea's experience with electricity, railways, telegraphs, telephones, and modern education during Gojong's reign provided a foundation that would be built upon after independence.[^125]

### Complex Historical Assessment

The historical assessment of Emperor Gojong remains complex and contested. He is seen as a monarch who genuinely attempted to preserve Korean sovereignty and modernize the nation through the Gwangmu Reform and diplomatic maneuvering, but who ultimately failed to prevent Japanese colonization.[^126] He ascended the shaky Korean throne at age twelve and attempted in vain to defend the kingdom from external encroachments for over four decades.[^127] His efforts to modernize Korea and maintain its independence were overshadowed by increasing Japanese aggression, leading to Korea's eventual annexation in 1910.[^128]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many Korean historians view Emperor Gojong sympathetically as a monarch who faced impossible circumstances. He inherited a weakened kingdom surrounded by aggressive imperial powers—China, Japan, and Russia—all competing for influence over the Korean peninsula.[^129] Scholars note that his Gwangmu Reform represented Korea's first systematic attempt at modernization, introducing electricity, railways, modern education, and industrial development.[^130] The abolition of the slave system and granting equal legal status to all classes represented progressive social reforms rare in East Asia at that time.[^131]

Defenders of Gojong emphasize that his diplomatic strategy of playing great powers against each other initially showed success, temporarily preventing any single nation from dominating Korea.[^132] His proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897 was a bold assertion of Korean sovereignty and equality with neighboring empires.[^133] The treaty with the United States in 1882 demonstrated his understanding that Korea needed Western allies to balance Asian powers.[^134]

Korean nationalist historians portray Gojong as a patriot who resisted Japanese imperialism until his final days. His refusal to legitimize the Eulsa Treaty, his secret dispatch of emissaries to The Hague, and his rumored refusal to sign an oath opposing independence all demonstrate his commitment to Korean sovereignty.[^135] His death became a rallying point for Korean independence, suggesting that even in death he served the cause of Korean liberation.[^136]

Modern Korean scholarship also credits Gojong with cultural preservation efforts. His investment in the Hanseong Electric Company and personal interest in modern technology showed a monarch engaged with the contemporary world rather than clinging to outdated traditions.[^137] His elevation of Queen Min to empress posthumously despite Japanese pressure demonstrated personal loyalty and political defiance.[^138]

### Negative Views

Critical historians argue that Emperor Gojong's weaknesses and poor decisions accelerated Korea's loss of independence. His over-reliance on foreign powers rather than building Korea's own military and economic strength left the country vulnerable and dependent.[^139] By requesting Chinese intervention during the Donghak Rebellion, he directly provided Japan with the pretext for military intervention that led to increased Japanese control.[^140]

Critics point to Gojong's failure to effectively modernize Korea's military despite multiple attempts. The creation of the new byeolgigun while neglecting the traditional army led to the Imo Incident, demonstrating poor planning and insensitivity to military morale.[^141] His military forces proved unable to resist foreign intervention repeatedly, from the French campaign of 1866 through the American expedition of 1871 to Japanese occupation in the 1900s.[^142]

Some historians criticize the Gwangmu Reform as too little, too late, and insufficiently comprehensive compared to Japan's Meiji Restoration or China's Self-Strengthening Movement.[^143] While Korea introduced railways and electricity, it failed to develop the industrial base, modern military, and reformed government structures necessary to resist imperialism.[^144] The reforms were superficial modernization of infrastructure without fundamental transformation of political and economic systems.[^145]

Gojong's political judgment is questioned by scholars who note his inability to choose reliable advisors or maintain stable government. His early dependence on his father, then on Queen Min and her family, showed an inability to govern independently.[^146] The nepotism and corruption of the Min family during Queen Min's ascendancy weakened the government and created internal factionalism.[^147] His flight to the Russian legation, while understandable given the circumstances, humiliated Korea internationally and demonstrated the weakness of Korean sovereignty.[^148]

Some Korean historians argue that Gojong's diplomatic strategy of balancing powers was naive and doomed to fail against determined Japanese imperialism backed by superior military force.[^149] His signing of unequal treaties beginning with the Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876 set precedents that progressively eroded Korean sovereignty.[^150] The failure of the Hague mission demonstrated either poor planning or unrealistic expectations about international support for Korean independence.[^151]
