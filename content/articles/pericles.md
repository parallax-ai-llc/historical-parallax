## Summary

Pericles (495–429 BCE) was an Athenian statesman, general, and orator who shaped the Golden Age of Athens and transformed its democracy into what historians call "radical democracy."[^1] Under his leadership from approximately 461 to 429 BCE, Athens flourished as the political and cultural center of ancient Greece, leaving an enduring legacy through monumental architecture like the Parthenon and democratic innovations that influenced Western civilization.[^2] Though celebrated for expanding citizen participation in government and promoting arts and philosophy, Pericles also faced criticism for Athenian imperialism and responsibility for the devastating Peloponnesian War.[^3] His vision of participatory democracy, where ordinary citizens were paid to engage in public affairs, became a foundational principle for modern democratic systems.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Pericles was born around 495 BCE in Athens to an aristocratic family of considerable political influence and military distinction.[^5] His father, Xanthippus (c. 525–475 BCE), was a respected politician and war hero who commanded the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale in 479 BCE, despite having been ostracized in 485–484 BCE.[^6] His mother, Agariste, belonged to the powerful and controversial Alcmaeonidae family, providing crucial familial connections that would later facilitate Pericles' political career.[^7] Agariste was the great-granddaughter of Cleisthenes, the tyrant of Sicyon, and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes, who had established fundamental democratic reforms in Athens.[^8]

According to the Greek historian Herodotus, a few days before Pericles' birth, Agariste dreamed she bore a lion—an omen that ancient Greeks would have interpreted as foretelling greatness and strength.[^9] Despite this dramatic portent, Pericles' early years were remarkably quiet and withdrawn from public attention.[^10] The introverted young Pericles avoided public appearances, instead preferring to devote his time to his studies, a pattern quite different from the typical path of ambitious young Athenian aristocrats who usually sought early recognition through public speaking and political involvement.[^11]

His family's nobility and considerable wealth allowed Pericles to fully pursue his inclination toward education, receiving what contemporaries considered a stellar education.[^12] He learned music from masters of the time—either Damon or Pythocleides could have been his music teacher—and Pericles is considered to have been the first politician to attribute significant importance to philosophy.[^13] The young Pericles received instruction in mathematics under the theoretical physicist Zeno of Elea, whose paradoxes challenged conventional thinking about motion and infinity.[^14] He seems to have taken full advantage of the society of Zeno and particularly the philosopher Anaxagoras, from whom he is said to have learned impassivity in the face of trouble and insult, as well as skepticism about alleged divine phenomena—a rationalist approach that would characterize his later political leadership.[^15]

This philosophical education distinguished Pericles from his political contemporaries and gave him rhetorical skills and logical reasoning abilities that would prove formidable in Athenian political debates.[^16] The first known date in his political life is 472 BCE, when he served as choregos (financial sponsor) for the production of the playwright Aeschylus' Persian trilogy, demonstrating both his wealth and his early interest in promoting Athenian culture.[^17] This public gesture, though modest, marked the beginning of a career that would transform Athens and influence the course of Western civilization for millennia to come.

## Rise to Power

Pericles' ascent to political dominance in Athens occurred through a combination of strategic alliances, calculated political prosecutions, and democratic reforms that appealed to ordinary Athenian citizens.[^18] His rise was neither immediate nor inevitable, but rather the result of carefully orchestrated moves against the conservative aristocratic faction that had traditionally dominated Athenian politics.[^19]

The political landscape of Athens in the 460s BCE was divided between conservatives, led by the aristocratic general Cimon, who favored cooperation with Sparta, and democrats, who sought to expand popular participation in government and maintain Athens' growing naval empire.[^20] Pericles aligned himself with the democratic faction and particularly with Ephialtes, an older politician who became his mentor and political ally.[^21] In 463 BCE, Pericles took a bold step by serving as the leading prosecutor of Cimon, who was accused of neglecting Athens's vital interests in Macedon.[^22] Although Cimon was acquitted, this confrontation demonstrated that Pericles' major political opponent was vulnerable to attack and marked Pericles as a rising force in Athenian politics.[^23]

Around 461 BCE, the democratic party decided to strike at the Areopagus, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy that exercised significant political power.[^24] Ephialtes proposed a radical reduction of the Areopagus's powers, which the Ecclesia (citizen assembly) adopted without opposition, signaling the beginning of a new era of "radical democracy" in Athens.[^25] This same year, Pericles achieved the political elimination of Cimon through ostracism—a democratic procedure where citizens could vote to exile a politician for ten years—with the accusation that Cimon had betrayed his city by aiding Sparta.[^26]

The assassination of Ephialtes in 461 BCE under mysterious circumstances paved the way for Pericles to consolidate his authority as the undisputed leader of the democratic party.[^27] Without opposition after the expulsion of Cimon, Pericles became the unchallengeable ruler of Athens, though he held only the formal office of strategos (general).[^28] His influence was so great that Thucydides later described Athens as being, "in name a democracy but in fact governed by its first man."[^29]

After securing his political position, Pericles continued to promote a populist social policy designed to strengthen his support among ordinary citizens.[^30] He proposed a decree that permitted poor citizens to watch theatrical plays without paying, democratizing access to Athens' rich cultural life.[^31] He lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BCE, opening this important magistracy to a broader segment of the population.[^32] Most significantly, he bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the people's court), enabling even the poorest Athenians to participate in the administration of justice.[^33]

Pericles simultaneously guided both Athens' foreign policy through the creation of empire and its domestic policy through the rise of "radical democracy," which introduced the revolutionary principle of "pay for service"—Athenian citizens were paid by the state to participate in public affairs.[^34] This innovation meant that ordinary Athenian citizens, including the poor, could afford the time to participate in politics, transforming Athens from a limited democracy where common people deferred to their aristocratic betters into a fully confident popular government in which the mass of people were sovereign in fact as well as theory.[^35]

From the end of the 460s BCE until his death in 429 BCE, Pericles held the office of strategos for seventeen consecutive years, frequently being recognized as "strategos autokrator," or commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[^36] Though the Athenian assembly gave Pericles what he wanted, the assembly itself remained the sovereign body, and Pericles maintained his influence not through constitutional authority but through his unmatched powers of persuasion and his ability to articulate a vision for Athens that resonated with the citizen body.[^37]

## Major Achievements

Pericles' achievements as leader of Athens encompassed transformative democratic reforms, an ambitious building program that created some of Western civilization's most iconic monuments, and the establishment of Athens as the cultural and intellectual center of the ancient Greek world.[^38]

**Democratic Innovations and Radical Democracy**

Pericles ushered in what historians consider "radical democracy," a system where ordinary Athenian citizens were paid by the state to participate in public affairs, fundamentally transforming who could engage in political life.[^39] Previously, only the wealthy could afford the time to participate in politics, but Pericles' reforms democratized political participation by providing payment for jury duty, for soldiers and sailors, and for administrators.[^40] This development transformed the character of Athenian democracy and society; lower-class Athenians (called thetes) could now participate as fully as citizens with property, creating an unprecedented level of political equality within the citizen body.[^41]

These reforms extended citizenship rights and fundamentally altered the balance of power in Athens.[^42] The payment system enabled approximately 20,000 Athenians to participate in various governmental functions, from serving on juries to attending assembly meetings, creating an engaged citizenry that took democracy seriously.[^43] Though modern observers note that women, children, resident aliens, and slaves remained excluded from political life, the principle of equality within the political community that Athens invented became the seed of the modern idea of universal egalitarianism.[^44]

**The Periclean Building Program and the Parthenon**

Pericles' most visible legacy can be found in the architectural monuments he commissioned, particularly the structures on the Acropolis.[^45] Starting around 449 BCE, Pericles proposed a decree allowing the use of 9,000 talents from the Delian League treasury to finance a major rebuilding program of Athenian temples that had been destroyed by the Persians during their invasion decades earlier.[^46] This ambitious project generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis, including the Propylaea (the monumental gateway), the Parthenon, and the golden statue of Athena sculpted by Pericles' friend Phidias.[^47]

Construction of the Parthenon began in 447 BCE and continued until 432 BCE, becoming the most famous architectural achievement of the classical world.[^48] The temple honoring Athena was meant to advertise Athens' power and wealth to all of Greece and stands today as an enduring symbol of classical civilization.[^49] The building program employed thousands of craftsmen—architects, sculptors, stonemasons, carpenters, and painters—distributing wealth throughout Athenian society while creating monuments that would inspire Western architecture for millennia.[^50]

However, this magnificent building program was controversial even in Pericles' own time.[^51] It was from the Delian League's treasury—funds contributed by allied Greek cities supposedly for mutual defense against Persia—that Pericles drew the money to finance his building projects, leading to accusations of imperialism as many member states began to feel they were being exploited for Athenian gain.[^52] These tensions foreshadowed conflicts that would culminate in the devastating Peloponnesian War.[^53]

**Cultural and Intellectual Leadership**

Pericles promoted the arts and literature with deliberate intent, and it was principally through his efforts that Athens acquired the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world.[^54] During the Age of Pericles, Athens blossomed as a center of education, art, culture, and philosophy, attracting intellectuals, artists, and philosophers from throughout the Mediterranean.[^55] The city became a hub of learning and creativity, setting the stage for its lasting influence on Western civilization.[^56]

Under Pericles' patronage, Athens reached new heights in drama, with playwrights like Sophocles and Euripides producing works that are still performed today.[^57] Philosophers including Anaxagoras and later Socrates engaged in philosophical inquiries that laid foundations for Western thought.[^58] Historians like Herodotus and Thucydides developed new approaches to understanding the past.[^59] This flowering of intellectual and artistic achievement became known as the Golden Age of Athens, and much of it occurred under Pericles' deliberate encouragement and state support.[^60]

**Military Leadership and Imperial Expansion**

As strategos, Pericles led several crucial military missions that expanded and secured Athenian power.[^61] These included Athens' recapture of Delphi from the Spartans in 448 BCE, ensuring Athenian influence over this important religious site.[^62] During the Samian War of 440–439 BCE, Pericles led the Athenian navy in a siege of Samos, one of Athens' most powerful allies that had rebelled against Athenian dominance.[^63] He also led the invasion of Megara in 431 BCE as the Peloponnesian War began.[^64]

Around 449 BCE, the Delian League signed the Peace of Callias with Persia, ending nearly fifty years of intermittent fighting with the Persian Empire and securing Greek independence in the Aegean.[^65] While Pericles' role in this peace has been debated by historians, it marked a significant diplomatic achievement that allowed Athens to consolidate its control over its maritime empire.[^66] In 451 BCE, after Cimon returned from exile, Pericles supported negotiating a five-year truce with Sparta, demonstrating pragmatic diplomacy when military confrontation seemed disadvantageous.[^67]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Pericles faced substantial criticism both from ancient contemporaries and modern historians, particularly regarding his imperial policies, responsibility for the Peloponnesian War, and the nature of his democratic leadership.[^68]

**Accusations of Demagoguery and Manipulation**

Ancient sources frequently criticized Pericles as a demagogue who manipulated the Athenian people for his own political advantage.[^69] Plutarch, writing centuries later, mentioned that "many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands, festival-grants, and distributions of fees for public services, thereby falling into bad habits, and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures, instead of frugal and self-sufficing."[^70] Plutarch even suggests Pericles may have engaged in vote-buying, revealing a pragmatic approach to maintaining power within democratic structures.[^71]

The philosopher Plato rejected the glorification of Pericles and declared: "as I know, Pericles made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees."[^72] Aristotle similarly characterized Periclean rule as that of a demagogue.[^73] The term "demagogue" in ancient Athens referred to political leaders who appealed directly to the people rather than working through traditional aristocratic channels, though it carried negative connotations of manipulation and pandering.[^74] The consolidation of "demagogue" in its negative sense was largely due to Plutarch, who established "the statesman–demagogue distinction as a staple of both republican and democratic currents of thought."[^75]

**Responsibility for the Peloponnesian War**

Perhaps the most serious criticism of Pericles concerns his responsibility for the catastrophic Peloponnesian War that devastated Greece for a generation.[^76] Ancient historians laid substantial blame on Pericles and Athens for the war's causes, with Plutarch believing "that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics" with "a sort of arrogance and a love of strife."[^77] Plutarch began writing the life of Pericles to illustrate a man of unchallengeable virtue and greatness but finished rather puzzled by the picture he found in his sources of Pericles' responsibility for a needless war.[^78]

Modern scholars have been equally critical of Pericles' war strategy and his role in bringing about the conflict.[^79] Important scholars blame Pericles for refusing minor concessions that might have prevented war, implementing a strategy that was unforeseen by the enemy and lacked credibility, and pursuing a defensive approach too feeble to exploit opportunities when they arose.[^80] The historian Donald Kagan called the Periclean strategy "a form of wishful thinking that failed," while Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober stated Pericles "was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens' great defeat."[^81]

Kagan's detailed critique of the Periclean strategy identifies four fundamental flaws: first, Pericles' rejection of minor concessions brought about a war that might have been avoided; second, his defensive strategy was unforeseen by Sparta and lacked credibility as a deterrent; third, it was too feeble to exploit military opportunities when they arose; and fourth, it depended entirely on Pericles for proper execution and was abandoned after his death, revealing its inherent unsustainability.[^82]

**Athenian Imperialism and Exploitation of Allies**

Scholars have argued extensively about Pericles' "intransigent imperialism" and whether it represents a fundamental flaw in his leadership.[^83] Pericles' speeches, as recorded by Thucydides, demonstrate that he shared with many other political figures a "mistaken confidence in the power, glory, and reliability of warfare and the instruments of force."[^84] His heavy reliance on the Delian League's treasury "led to accusations of imperialism, as many member states began to feel that they were being exploited for Athenian gain," creating resentments that contributed to the Peloponnesian War.[^85]

Martha Taylor argues that Thucydides subtly critiques Pericles' vision of Athens as a city divorced from the territory of Attica and focused instead on the sea and empire, implicitly censuring "both Pericles and the Athenian imperial project itself."[^86] This interpretation suggests that even Thucydides, generally considered an admirer of Pericles, recognized fundamental problems with Periclean imperialism.[^87]

Loren J. Samons II presents a revisionist interpretation arguing that although contemporary historians have tended to treat Pericles as representative of values like liberty and equality, "the quest to make Athens the preeminent power in Greece served as the central theme of Pericles' career."[^88] Samons characterizes Pericles as "more nationalist than humanist and less rationalist than populist," arguing that Pericles' vision for Athens rested on establishing an Athenian reputation for military success and the citizens' willingness to sacrifice in service of imperial dominance.[^89]

**The Question of Democratic Authenticity**

A fundamental paradox exists at the heart of Pericles' legacy: he was a non-democratic aristocrat who nevertheless perfected Athenian democracy.[^90] Though he expanded democratic participation, his personal dominance of Athenian politics for three decades raises questions about whether Athens was genuinely democratic or merely ruled by a charismatic leader who manipulated democratic institutions.[^91] Thucydides' famous comment that Athens was "in name a democracy but in fact governed by its first man" captures this ambiguity.[^92]

## Personal Life

Pericles' personal life was marked by an unconventional relationship that scandalized conservative Athenians and by profound tragedy during the plague that struck Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.[^93]

**First Marriage and Sons**

Pericles was initially married to a woman whose name is not recorded in historical sources, with whom he had two legitimate sons: Xanthippus, named after Pericles' father, and Paralus.[^94] This marriage appears to have been typical of aristocratic Athenian marriages—arranged for political and economic alliance rather than affection.[^95] After approximately a decade of marriage, Pericles divorced his first wife around 445 BCE, and she subsequently remarried.[^96]

**Relationship with Aspasia of Miletus**

Aspasia's relationship with Pericles began sometime between 452 and 441 BCE, becoming one of the most famous partnerships in ancient history.[^97] Aspasia came from the Greek Anatolian city of Miletus and lived with Pericles from about 445 BCE until his death in 429 BCE.[^98] The exact nature of their relationship has been disputed, with ancient authors variously portraying her as a prostitute, his concubine, or his wife, reflecting the scandal and controversy their relationship generated.[^99]

Pericles never formally married Aspasia, probably because he could not do so legally due to a citizenship law he himself had introduced in 451 BCE that restricted citizenship to those with two Athenian parents.[^100] Since Aspasia was from Miletus, not Athens, any marriage would have been legally problematic under his own legislation.[^101] Nevertheless, their relationship was clearly one of genuine partnership and intellectual companionship.[^102]

The couple had one son together, Pericles the Younger, whose birth raised significant legal complications under the citizenship law that Pericles had enacted.[^103] As the son of an Athenian father and a non-Athenian mother, Pericles the Younger would not have qualified for citizenship under his father's own law.[^104] This ironic situation was only resolved after the plague of 429 BCE killed Pericles' two legitimate sons from his first marriage; the Athenians passed a special decree to grant citizenship to Pericles the Younger, acknowledging his father's service to the city.[^105]

**Aspasia's Influence and Reputation**

Ancient sources suggest that Aspasia was highly educated and intellectually formidable, qualities that attracted Pericles and made her a controversial figure in Athenian society.[^106] Some sources claim she taught rhetoric and influenced Pericles' famous oratorical skills.[^107] The philosopher Socrates reportedly visited their household and engaged Aspasia in philosophical discussions, suggesting she participated in the intellectual life of Athens in ways unusual for women of her era.[^108]

Conservative Athenians attacked Aspasia as part of their political campaigns against Pericles.[^109] She faced prosecution on charges of impiety and corrupting Athenian women, though Pericles successfully defended her.[^110] These attacks reflected both political opposition to Pericles and social discomfort with a foreign woman wielding influence over Athens' most powerful leader.[^111]

**Tragedy and the Plague**

The final years of Pericles' life were marked by devastating personal tragedy during the plague that struck Athens in 430 BCE.[^112] Before his own death, Pericles experienced catastrophic personal losses as the plague ravaged his family.[^113] His eldest son Xanthippus and his sister succumbed to the disease, followed by his second son Paralus.[^114] The death of Paralus broke Pericles' legendary self-control; witnesses reported that this was the only time they saw Pericles openly weep.[^115]

**Character and Personality**

Ancient sources describe Pericles as dignified, self-controlled, and somewhat aloof.[^116] Plutarch noted that Pericles maintained a serious demeanor in public and rarely attended social gatherings, preferring intellectual pursuits.[^117] He possessed an unusually long skull, which ancient sculptors diplomatically concealed by depicting him wearing a Corinthian helmet pushed back on his head.[^118] This distinctive physical feature became so associated with Pericles that all ancient representations show him with the helmet, turning a potential embarrassment into an iconic image.[^119]

After Pericles' death in 429 BCE, Aspasia entered a relationship with Lysicles, a wealthy Athenian citizen who achieved popularity as a political leader.[^120] Lysicles was killed during a military campaign in 428 BCE, and Aspasia disappeared from historical records soon afterwards, her final fate unknown.[^121]

## Legacy

Pericles' legacy extends far beyond his own era, fundamentally shaping Western concepts of democracy, civic participation, and the relationship between culture and political power.[^122]

**Democratic Innovations and Modern Democracy**

Pericles was largely responsible for the full development of Athenian democracy in the later 5th century BCE, making Athens the political and cultural focus of Greece.[^123] His vision of "radical democracy," where ordinary citizens were paid to participate in public affairs, transformed political participation from an aristocratic privilege to a civic right accessible to all male citizens.[^124] This innovation meant that lower-class Athenians could participate as fully as wealthy property owners, creating an unprecedented level of political equality.[^125]

The legacy of Pericles extends far beyond his own time, influencing modern political thought and democratic practices.[^126] His vision of a participatory democracy where citizens actively engage in governance became a foundational principle in contemporary democratic systems worldwide.[^127] Although the Athenians excluded women, children, resident aliens, and slaves from political life, the principle of equality within the political community that they invented was the seed of the modern idea of universal egalitarianism.[^128]

Modern democracies have expanded upon Pericles' innovations while correcting their exclusions, extending political participation to all adults regardless of gender, ethnicity, or economic status.[^129] The concept of paying citizens to participate in public service—through jury duty compensation, elected official salaries, and legislative stipends—directly descends from Periclean reforms.[^130]

**Architectural and Cultural Heritage**

Pericles' most visible legacy exists in the literary and artistic works of the Golden Age, much of which survives to this day.[^131] The Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis continue to stand as symbols of classical civilization and have inspired countless buildings worldwide, from government capitols to museums to universities.[^132] These monuments turned Athens into what Pericles envisioned: a permanent advertisement of Athenian cultural achievement that would educate future generations.[^133]

Pericles promoted arts and literature with the deliberate goal of making Athens the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world, and in this he succeeded beyond measure.[^134] During the Age of Pericles, Athens blossomed as a center of education, art, culture, and philosophy, setting standards that influenced Western civilization for millennia.[^135] The playwrights, philosophers, historians, and artists who flourished under Periclean Athens created works that remain foundational to Western culture.[^136]

**The Periclean Model of Leadership**

Athens lost its "first citizen" in 429 BCE, but Pericles' model of charismatic democratic leadership endures in modern political systems.[^137] His ability to lead through persuasion rather than constitutional authority, to articulate a compelling vision for his society, and to inspire citizens to pursue collective greatness rather than merely individual advantage has influenced political leaders for centuries.[^138]

The period during which Pericles led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BCE, is known as the "Age of Pericles," a designation that reflects how thoroughly one individual shaped an entire era.[^139] This new form of government was carried to its classical form by Pericles' reforms, and it was in the Athens shaped by Pericles that the greatest achievements of the Greeks took place.[^140]

**Complex and Contested Legacy**

Yet Pericles' legacy remains contested and complex.[^141] His imperial policies and responsibility for the Peloponnesian War cast shadows over his achievements.[^142] The Athenian empire he built ultimately collapsed, and the war he helped initiate devastated Greece for a generation.[^143] These failures remind us that even the most celebrated leaders make catastrophic miscalculations, and that democratic societies must critically examine their leaders' decisions rather than uncritically celebrating them.[^144]

Modern scholarship on Pericles reflects this complexity, with historians offering widely divergent assessments ranging from admiration to severe criticism.[^145] Some view him as a defender of democracy and champion of human achievement; others see him as a brutal imperialist and demagogue whose policies brought disaster to Athens.[^146] This scholarly division suggests that Pericles' legacy, like democracy itself, remains open to interpretation and debate—perhaps the most fitting legacy for a leader who championed open deliberation and civic engagement.[^147]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Pericles celebrate him as an extraordinary statesman who elevated Athens to unprecedented cultural, intellectual, and political heights.[^148] The historian Thucydides admired Pericles profoundly and refused to criticize him, presenting Pericles as the ideal democratic leader who guided Athens wisely through persuasion and vision rather than demagoguery.[^149] Thucydides' famous description of Athens as "in name a democracy but in fact governed by its first man" was intended as praise, suggesting that Pericles' personal excellence enhanced rather than diminished Athenian democracy.[^150]

Modern scholars who view Pericles positively emphasize his democratic reforms that expanded political participation beyond the wealthy elite.[^151] By implementing payment for public service, Pericles enabled ordinary citizens to participate fully in governance, transforming abstract democratic principles into practical reality.[^152] These reforms established Athens as a model of participatory democracy where citizens actively engaged in collective decision-making rather than passively deferring to aristocratic leadership.[^153]

Defenders of Pericles' building program argue that the Parthenon and other monuments represented a legitimate use of imperial resources that employed thousands of workers, distributed wealth throughout Athenian society, and created enduring cultural achievements that benefited all of Greece, not just Athens.[^154] The architectural and artistic accomplishments of the Periclean Age set standards of excellence that influenced Western civilization for millennia, making Athens the "school of Hellas" that Pericles proclaimed it to be in his Funeral Oration.[^155]

Scholars also credit Pericles with promoting intellectual and cultural achievements that fundamentally shaped Western thought.[^156] His patronage of philosophy, drama, architecture, and historical writing created an environment where human reason and creativity flourished, establishing patterns of inquiry and expression that remain foundational to Western culture.[^157] The Golden Age of Athens occurred under Pericles' leadership, and his vision of linking political freedom with cultural excellence created a model that continues to inspire democratic societies.[^158]

Biographers like Vincent Azoulay attempt to present a balanced assessment that recognizes both Pericles' achievements and his failings, arguing that his genuine accomplishments in expanding democracy and promoting culture deserve recognition even as his imperial policies and war strategy merit criticism.[^159] This approach seeks to understand Pericles in the context of his own time rather than judging him exclusively by modern standards.[^160]

### Negative Views

Critics of Pericles present a far less flattering assessment, characterizing him as a demagogue, imperialist, and warmonger whose policies brought catastrophe to Athens and suffering to Greece.[^161] Ancient critics including Plato condemned Pericles for corrupting Athenian character, with Plato declaring that Pericles "made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees."[^162] This critique suggests that paying citizens for public service undermined civic virtue by making Athenians dependent on state handouts rather than cultivating self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.[^163]

Plutarch, despite initially intending to write an admiring biography, became increasingly troubled by evidence of Pericles' responsibility for the needless Peloponnesian War.[^164] Plutarch believed that "Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics" with "a sort of arrogance and a love of strife," suggesting that Pericles' pride and desire for glory led Athens into a devastating conflict that could have been avoided.[^165]

Modern revisionist historians like Loren J. Samons II argue that the quest to make Athens the preeminent power in Greece served as the central theme of Pericles' career, characterizing him as "more nationalist than humanist and less rationalist than populist."[^166] This interpretation presents Pericles as an imperialist who used democratic rhetoric to pursue Athenian domination, exploiting allied cities by seizing their tribute payments to fund Athenian monuments and expansion.[^167]

The strategic failures of Pericles' war planning have drawn particularly harsh criticism from modern military historians.[^168] Donald Kagan called the Periclean strategy "a form of wishful thinking that failed," identifying multiple fundamental flaws including rejection of reasonable compromises, implementation of a defensive strategy that lacked credibility as deterrence, failure to exploit military opportunities, and creation of a strategy so dependent on Pericles personally that it collapsed immediately after his death.[^169] Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober concluded that Pericles "was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens' great defeat."[^170]

Critics also question whether Pericles genuinely believed in democracy or merely manipulated democratic institutions to maintain personal power.[^171] Some contemporary scholars call Pericles a populist and demagogue, suggesting that his democratic reforms were calculated to build a political base rather than expressions of principled commitment to equality.[^172] The fact that aristocratic Pericles dominated Athenian politics for three decades raises questions about whether Athens was genuinely democratic or effectively ruled by a charismatic strongman who controlled the assembly through superior oratory.[^173]

Martha Taylor argues that even Thucydides subtly critiqued Pericles' vision of Athens as divorced from its agricultural territory and focused exclusively on sea power and empire, implicitly censuring "both Pericles and the Athenian imperial project itself."[^174] This interpretation suggests that Pericles' strategic vision was fundamentally flawed, prioritizing naval empire over sustainable connection to Athenian land and traditional values.[^175]

The historical debates ultimately center on whether Pericles was a defender of democracy or a threat to it, an enlightened leader or a brutal imperialist, a visionary statesman or a reckless warmonger.[^176] That scholars continue to disagree so fundamentally about Pericles' legacy more than two millennia after his death testifies to the complexity of his character and the enduring significance of the questions his career raises about democracy, empire, leadership, and political power.[^177]
