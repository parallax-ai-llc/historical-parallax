## Overview

The Gwangju Uprising (5.18 광주민주화운동) was a pro-democracy movement that occurred from May 18-27, 1980, in Gwangju, South Korea. Citizens rose up against the martial law government of General Chun Doo-hwan, and the military responded with brutal force, killing hundreds (possibly thousands) of civilians. Though crushed, the uprising became the moral foundation of South Korea's democracy movement.

Controversy over U.S. knowledge/approval of troop movements. U.S. command structure technically controlled Korean military. Led to anti-American sentiment.

### Tiananmen Comparison

Often compared to 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre—similar military suppression of democracy movement.
