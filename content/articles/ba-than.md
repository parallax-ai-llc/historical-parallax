## Summary

Ba Than (1870s – c. November 1931) was a pioneering Burmese educator, historian, writer, and journalist who profoundly influenced Myanmar's educational landscape during the British colonial period. He is best known for authoring Myanmar Yazawin, the first comprehensive Burmese-language history textbook, which became the standard text in Burmese high schools from 1930 to the 1950s. As a teacher in nationalist schools and a B.A. graduate from Rangoon College during an era when higher education was accessible only to an elite few, Ba Than dedicated his career to preserving Burmese cultural identity and historical consciousness. His work bridged traditional Burmese chronicles with Western historiographical methods, creating an educational foundation that shaped nationalist sentiment during Burma's struggle for independence.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Ba Than was born in the 1870s in Bassein (modern-day Pathein), a major port city in the Irrawaddy Delta region of Lower Burma. He was the youngest son of U Maung Lay and Daw Ma Ma, a family that would produce several notable figures in British Burma's intellectual and cultural life. His eldest brother, U Sein, became the longtime chief editor of the anti-colonialist Myanma Alin newspaper, while another brother, Ba Gyan (1902-1953), achieved fame as a pioneering cartoonist and writer under the pen name Pathein Ba Gyan, creating Burma's first animated films and comic books in the 1930s.[^3][^4]

Growing up in Bassein during the late 19th century, Ba Than witnessed firsthand the transformations brought by British colonial rule. The British had annexed Lower Burma, including Bassein, in 1852 following the Second Anglo-Burmese War, and completed their conquest of the entire country in 1886 after the Third Anglo-Burmese War. This period saw dramatic changes to Burma's social, economic, and educational systems. Traditional Buddhist monastic education, which had been the primary educational system for centuries, was gradually being supplanted by a secular colonial education system designed to produce civil servants and facilitate British administration.[^5][^6]

Despite the challenging circumstances, Ba Than's family valued education and ensured their sons received quality schooling. Ba Than excelled academically and earned a B.A. degree from Rangoon College, an extraordinary achievement in an era when university education was accessible to only a tiny privileged minority. Rangoon College, established in 1878 as an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta, represented the apex of educational opportunity in colonial Burma. The college offered courses in English, History, Mathematics, Pali Language, Chemistry, Physics, and Logic, providing students with both Western academic training and exposure to traditional Burmese learning.[^7][^8]

After completing his degree, Ba Than faced a career choice that revealed his character and priorities. Rather than pursuing more lucrative opportunities in colonial administration or the legal profession—paths chosen by many educated Burmese of his generation—Ba Than chose to become a school teacher. This decision reflected a commitment to education and cultural preservation that would define his entire career. He began teaching at Shin Maha Buddhaghosa High School in Moulmein (modern Mawlamyine), a nationalist school founded in 1899 by the Sāsanādhāra Society specifically to counter the spread of Christian missionary education and preserve Buddhist and Burmese cultural values.[^9][^10]

## Rise to Prominence

Ba Than's rise to prominence as an educator and historian occurred gradually through decades of dedicated teaching and scholarship in nationalist schools across Lower Burma. At Shin Maha Buddhaghosa High School in Moulmein, one of the first nationalist schools established in Burma, Ba Than taught multiple subjects including English, Burmese, geography, mathematics, and history. This diverse teaching experience gave him a comprehensive understanding of curriculum development and pedagogical methods, while his deep engagement with history instruction revealed the absence of quality Burmese-language historical materials.[^11][^12]

The nationalist school movement, which gained momentum in the 1890s as a response to British educational policies, provided Ba Than with an ideological community committed to preserving Burmese identity. These schools, founded by Buddhist organizations and Burmese nationalists, sought to offer education that honored traditional values while incorporating modern subjects. Following the 1920 university student strike—sparked by protests against changes to Rangoon College that were viewed as elitist and exclusionary—nationalist schools proliferated throughout Burma. The strike, which came to be commemorated as "National Day," saw students refuse to return to government and mission schools, leading to the establishment of alternative educational institutions across the country.[^13][^14]

Ba Than moved between several nationalist schools during his career, eventually joining the faculty at Taingyintha High School in Kangyidaunt, a town near his native Bassein. By 1929, he had accumulated years of experience teaching Burmese history to high school students and had grown increasingly frustrated with the limitations of available teaching materials. The existing texts were either traditional Burmese chronicles written in classical Pali and old Burmese that were inaccessible to most students, or histories written by British colonial historians in English that approached Burmese history from an imperialist perspective.[^15][^16]

Recognizing this gap, Ba Than embarked on an ambitious project to create the first comprehensive Burmese-language history textbook specifically designed for high school students. Working at Taingyintha High School in Kangyidaunt during 1929, he drew upon his many years of teaching experience and extensive historical research to write Myanmar Yazawin (Burmese History). The project required synthesizing diverse sources: traditional Burmese chronicles including the Hmannan Yazawin (Glass Palace Chronicle of 1829-1832) and the earlier Maha Yazawin (Great Chronicle completed in 1724 by U Kala), histories written by British scholars including Sir Arthur Purves Phayre, G.E. Harvey, and S.W. Cocks, and English translations of Siamese and Lan Na histories that provided regional context.[^17][^18][^19]

Ba Than's methodological approach represented a significant intellectual achievement. He critically evaluated multiple sources, cross-referenced chronologies, and synthesized traditional Burmese historiographical traditions with Western scholarly methods. Rather than simply reproducing chronicles or translating colonial histories, he created an original narrative that presented Burmese history in accessible modern Burmese language while maintaining scholarly rigor. He completed the manuscript in late 1929 and arranged for its publication in 1930, making Myanmar Yazawin the first full-fledged Burmese-language history textbook produced in British Burma.[^20][^21]

The book's publication immediately established Ba Than as a prominent figure in Burmese education and historiography. Myanmar Yazawin was an instant success, quickly adopted as the standard history textbook in nationalist schools and many government vernacular schools throughout the country. For the first time, Burmese students could study their own history in their own language using a modern textbook format. The book's success reflected both its scholarly quality and the profound hunger among Burmese people for educational materials that affirmed their cultural identity during colonial subjugation.[^22][^23]

---

## Major Achievements

Ba Than's most significant achievement was the creation and publication of Myanmar Yazawin, a work that transformed history education in Burma and contributed substantially to the development of Burmese nationalist consciousness. The first edition, published in 1930, became immediately and widely adopted as the prescribed Myanmar history textbook in Burmese vernacular high schools throughout the country. The book's importance cannot be overstated: it was the first comprehensive history of Burma written in modern Burmese specifically for educational purposes, making Burmese history accessible to thousands of students who would otherwise have learned their nation's past only through British colonial narratives or inaccessible classical texts.[^24][^25]

The textbook's scholarly foundation demonstrated Ba Than's mastery of both traditional Burmese and Western historiographical traditions. He consulted the Hmannan Yazawin, the official royal chronicle of the Konbaung Dynasty compiled between 1829 and 1832, which had served as the main reference for early European scholars writing about Burmese history. He also drew extensively from the Maha Yazawin, the pioneering 1724 chronicle by U Kala that was the first to synthesize all ancient, regional, foreign, and biographic histories related to Burma. By incorporating material from these traditional chronicles alongside histories written by British scholars such as A.P. Phayre, S.W. Cocks, and G.E. Harvey, Ba Than created a comprehensive narrative that respected traditional Burmese historical consciousness while meeting modern scholarly standards.[^26][^27][^28]

The book's immediate success prompted Ba Than to begin work on a second, expanded edition almost immediately after the first edition's publication. He incorporated additional material from Western historians including A. Dalrymple, J. Gray, and D.G.E. Hall, and integrated feedback from Burmese scholars and writers who had reviewed the first edition. Ba Than completed the second edition in November 1930, demonstrating his commitment to continuous scholarly improvement and responsiveness to academic criticism. Tragically, he died shortly after finishing this revision in late 1930 or early 1931, at approximately 60 years of age, before he could see the full impact of his life's work.[^29][^30]

Beyond his monumental historical textbook, Ba Than contributed to Burmese literary and journalistic culture through various channels. He published a novel titled "B.A. Maung Ba Lwin" in 1919, a work that presumably drew upon his own experiences as a B.A. graduate navigating colonial Burma's social landscape. He wrote numerous newspaper columns, short stories, and poems under several pen names, demonstrating versatility across literary genres. These writings, while less famous than Myanmar Yazawin, reflected his engagement with contemporary social issues and his commitment to developing Burmese-language literature during the colonial period.[^31][^32]

In 1924, Ba Than co-founded the Myo-Chit newspaper, contributing to the development of Burma's nationalist press. Newspapers played a crucial role in the Burmese independence movement, providing forums for political debate, cultural preservation, and resistance to colonial policies. The Myo-Chit newspaper, though short-lived, represented Ba Than's recognition that education and political consciousness required multiple channels of communication. His involvement in journalism complemented his educational work, as both endeavors aimed to strengthen Burmese cultural identity and political awareness.[^33][^34]

The lasting influence of Myanmar Yazawin extended far beyond Ba Than's lifetime. After his death in 1931, his eldest brother U Sein, the longtime editor of the Myanma Alin newspaper, took responsibility for maintaining and updating the textbook. U Sein published six more editions between 1932 and 1952, each incorporating periodic updates to reflect new scholarship and historical developments. The seventh edition, published in 1951, included material extending to Burma's independence on January 4, 1948, allowing students to study their nation's complete journey from ancient kingdoms through colonial subjugation to sovereign independence. The book remained in use in Burmese high schools throughout the 1940s and 1950s, only falling out of regular use after 1962 following Ne Win's military coup.[^35][^36][^37]

The textbook was republished in 1991, decades after it had ceased being used in schools, specifically to raise public awareness of this important historical work. This revival demonstrated the enduring significance of Ba Than's contribution to Burmese historiography and education. Myanmar Yazawin represented a crucial bridge between traditional Burmese historical consciousness and modern nationalist education, shaping how an entire generation of Burmese people understood their history and identity during the critical decades leading to independence.[^38][^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his significant contributions to Burmese education and historiography, Ba Than's work was not without limitations and potential criticisms, though surviving records contain relatively few explicit contemporary critiques. The primary methodological challenge in Ba Than's Myanmar Yazawin stemmed from the inherent difficulties in synthesizing traditional Burmese chronicles with Western historical scholarship. Burmese chronicles, particularly the Hmannan Yazawin and Maha Yazawin upon which Ba Than relied heavily, present complex historiographical problems regarding dating, legendary material, and the relationship between historical events and literary embellishment.[^40][^41]

The Hmannan Yazawin, compiled by the Royal Historical Commission between 1829 and 1832, served as the main chronicle referenced by early European scholars writing Burmese history. However, subsequent archaeological and epigraphic research revealed various chronological inaccuracies, particularly regarding the Pagan Dynasty and pre-Pagan periods. Later chronicles, including works that followed Ba Than's textbook, corrected many of these dating problems based on epigraphic evidence discovered in the 20th century. Ba Than, writing in 1929-1930, necessarily relied on the best available sources of his time, but inevitably his work contained dating errors and legendary material presented as historical fact that later scholarship would question or disprove.[^42][^43]

The Western historical works Ba Than consulted—particularly those by British colonial historians like A.P. Phayre and G.E. Harvey—carried their own biases and limitations. Colonial historians typically approached Burmese history through frameworks that emphasized British civilizing missions, portrayed pre-colonial Burma as chaotic or despotic, and interpreted historical developments as leading inevitably toward British administration. While Ba Than attempted to balance these perspectives with traditional Burmese sources, the very act of synthesis potentially internalized some colonial assumptions about historical progress, political legitimacy, and cultural development.[^44][^45]

As a textbook designed for nationalist schools and used during the independence movement, Myanmar Yazawin likely emphasized narratives that supported Burmese national identity and anti-colonial sentiment. While this served important political and cultural purposes during the colonial period, it may have resulted in somewhat selective historical emphasis. Nationalist historiography often highlights resistance to foreign domination, cultural achievements, and historical periods of unity and strength, while potentially downplaying internal conflicts, regional diversity, and complexities that might complicate simple nationalist narratives.[^46][^47]

The post-independence revision history of Myanmar Yazawin reveals how the text was adapted to serve nation-building purposes. The seventh edition (1951), updated by Ba Than's brother U Sein to include independence in 1948, explicitly incorporated Burma's achievement of sovereignty into the historical narrative. Later scholarly assessments of Burmese history education note that textbooks under both the parliamentary period and subsequent military governments emphasized nationalist perspectives and highlighted heroes like General Aung San, constructing a unified "Myanmar nation" identity. While Ba Than's original 1930 text preceded these more explicitly politicized revisions, his work established patterns that later editions would amplify.[^48][^49]

Some contemporary historians have criticized the tendency of early 20th-century Burmese historians to accept chronicle narratives uncritically, particularly regarding pre-11th century history dominated by legendary material. The historian Than Tun, for example, developed a more rigorous, demonstrative methodology that moved beyond the glorification of dynasties common in pre-modern history studies. However, it should be noted that Ba Than was writing an educational textbook for high school students in 1929, not an academic research monograph, and his synthesis of available sources represented the scholarly consensus of his era rather than methodological failures unique to his work.[^50][^51]

The book's eventual obsolescence and removal from high schools after 1962 reflected both changing political circumstances under military rule and advances in historical scholarship that rendered Ba Than's 1930 synthesis outdated. The military government that took power in 1962 under General Ne Win sought to control historical narratives through new textbooks that served its specific ideological purposes. Additionally, archaeological discoveries, epigraphic research, and refined historiographical methods developed between 1930 and 1962 provided scholars with tools and evidence unavailable to Ba Than, making his work increasingly dated despite its pioneering importance.[^52][^53]

## Personal Life

Ba Than's personal life reflected the values of dedication to education, cultural preservation, and family commitment that characterized the Burmese intellectual class during the colonial period. Born into a family in Bassein (Pathein) that valued education and nationalist principles, Ba Than was the youngest of three brothers who all achieved prominence in different fields of cultural and intellectual life. This family background provided both material support for his education and an ideological framework that shaped his career choices and life's work.[^54][^55]

His decision to become a school teacher despite holding a B.A. from Rangoon College—a credential that could have secured more prestigious and lucrative positions in colonial administration or professional fields—reveals much about his character and priorities. Teaching in the late 19th and early 20th century Burma was not a highly remunerative profession, particularly in nationalist schools that often struggled financially despite popular support. Ba Than's choice to dedicate himself to education rather than pursue wealth or status demonstrates a commitment to service and cultural preservation that defined his entire career.[^56][^57]

Ba Than's teaching career took him to various locations across Lower Burma, including extended periods at Shin Maha Buddhaghosa High School in Moulmein and later at Taingyintha High School in Kangyidaunt. These movements suggest a willingness to work in different educational settings and communities, adapting to various institutional contexts while maintaining his core mission of educating Burmese youth. His long tenure at Shin Maha Buddhaghosa, one of the pioneering nationalist schools founded in 1899, positioned him within a community of educators and Buddhist scholars committed to preserving Burmese cultural identity against the encroachment of Christian missionary education and colonial cultural domination.[^58][^59]

Beyond his primary work as a teacher and historian, Ba Than maintained an active intellectual life that included creative writing and journalism. He wrote under several pen names, producing newspaper columns, short stories, and poems that addressed contemporary social issues and contributed to the development of modern Burmese literature. This versatility suggests a creative temperament and engagement with the broader cultural currents of his time. His 1919 novel "B.A. Maung Ba Lwin" may have been somewhat autobiographical, exploring the experiences of educated Burmese individuals navigating colonial society's contradictions and opportunities.[^60][^61]

His co-founding of the Myo-Chit newspaper in 1924 demonstrated his recognition that cultural and political consciousness required multiple channels of communication. This journalistic venture, though short-lived, reflected Ba Than's understanding that education extended beyond classroom walls and that newspapers played crucial roles in shaping public opinion and fostering nationalist sentiment. The collaborative nature of newspaper founding also suggests Ba Than's ability to work within intellectual networks and his commitment to collective cultural projects.[^62]

The final years of Ba Than's life were dominated by the intensive work of completing Myanmar Yazawin and immediately revising it for a second edition. Writing at Taingyintha High School in Kangyidaunt during 1929, he synthesized decades of teaching experience and historical research into a comprehensive textbook. The immediate success of the first edition in 1930 prompted him to begin expanding and revising the work almost immediately, incorporating additional Western historical sources and feedback from Burmese scholars. This rapid cycle of publication and revision—completing the second edition by November 1930—suggests a driven personality acutely aware of the importance of his work and eager to perfect it.[^63][^64]

Ba Than died shortly after completing the second edition of Myanmar Yazawin, probably in late 1930 or early 1931, at approximately 60 years of age. The exact circumstances of his death are not well documented in available sources. That he died so soon after finishing his life's major work adds a poignant dimension to his story—he barely lived to see the initial success of Myanmar Yazawin and did not witness its decades-long influence on Burmese education or its role in shaping nationalist consciousness during the independence movement.[^65]

The continuity of his work through his family, particularly through his brother U Sein who maintained and updated Myanmar Yazawin through six additional editions until 1952, demonstrates the strength of family bonds and shared commitment to Ba Than's educational mission. U Sein's dedication to preserving and updating his younger brother's work for over two decades ensured that Myanmar Yazawin remained relevant through Burma's transition from colonial rule to independence, extending Ba Than's influence far beyond his lifetime.[^66]

## Legacy

Ba Than's legacy centers primarily on his transformative contribution to Burmese education through Myanmar Yazawin, a textbook that fundamentally altered how Burmese students learned their national history during the crucial decades of the independence movement and early statehood. The book's adoption as the standard history text in Burmese vernacular schools from 1930 through the 1950s meant that an entire generation of educated Burmese—including many who would become leaders in the independence movement and post-colonial government—learned their national history through Ba Than's synthesis of traditional chronicles and modern historiography.[^67][^68]

The textbook's significance extended beyond mere factual historical education. During the colonial period, when British narratives dominated official discourse and education, Myanmar Yazawin provided Burmese students with a history told from a Burmese perspective in the Burmese language. This was profoundly important for maintaining cultural identity and fostering nationalist consciousness. Students reading Ba Than's textbook in the 1930s and 1940s learned that Burma had a long, complex history extending back millennia before British colonization, that Burmese kingdoms had achieved remarkable cultural and political accomplishments, and that Burmese civilization possessed sophistication and legitimacy independent of Western validation.[^69][^70]

Several prominent nationalist leaders, including U Nu and Aung San, attended nationalist schools during the period when Myanmar Yazawin would have been among the standard texts. U Nu, who became Burma's first post-independence Prime Minister, attributed his political awakening to "the books on freedom and independence he had read in the national school… and the study made of the lives of freedom fighters." While Ba Than's textbook was primarily historical rather than overtly political, its very existence as a Burmese-language history affirmed that Burmese culture and identity were worth preserving and celebrating, contributing to the broader nationalist consciousness that made independence possible.[^71][^72]

The longevity of Myanmar Yazawin—published in eight editions between 1930 and 1952—testifies to its enduring value and relevance. That Ba Than's brother U Sein continued updating the text through independence and into the early 1950s demonstrates both familial dedication and recognition of the text's ongoing importance. The seventh edition's extension to include Burma's independence in 1948 symbolically completed the historical narrative Ba Than had begun, connecting ancient Burmese kingdoms through colonial subjugation to sovereign restoration.[^73][^74]

Ba Than's methodological approach—synthesizing traditional Burmese chronicles with Western historical scholarship—created a model that influenced subsequent Burmese historical writing. He demonstrated that Burmese scholars could engage critically with both indigenous and colonial sources, creating narratives that honored traditional historical consciousness while meeting modern standards of evidence and argumentation. This synthetic approach, though not without limitations, represented an intellectual decolonization that paralleled the political independence movement.[^75][^76]

The formation of the Myanmar Historical Commission on January 26, 1955, under Prime Minister U Nu, reflected the independent government's recognition that historical scholarship was crucial for nation-building. While Ba Than had died more than two decades earlier, his pioneering work in creating accessible Burmese-language historical education had helped establish the foundations upon which institutional historical scholarship could develop. The commission's work of documenting and preserving Myanmar's historical narrative built upon the educational groundwork Ba Than had laid.[^77]

Ba Than's decision to become a teacher rather than pursue more lucrative careers, and his decades of dedication to nationalist education, embodied values of service and cultural commitment that the independence movement celebrated. Teachers in nationalist schools operated under difficult conditions, often with inadequate funding and in opposition to colonial educational policies, yet they persisted because they believed education was essential to preserving Burmese identity and achieving independence. Ba Than's life exemplified this dedication, making him a representative figure of the nationalist educational movement.[^78][^79]

The 1991 republication of Myanmar Yazawin, decades after it had ceased being used as a school textbook, demonstrated its enduring historical significance. Published specifically "to raise the awareness of the book among the public," this revival recognized Myanmar Yazawin not merely as an outdated textbook but as an important historical document in its own right—a work that had shaped how a generation understood their history and that represented a crucial moment in the development of Burmese historiography and nationalist consciousness.[^80]

Ba Than's legacy also extends through his family's continued contributions to Burmese culture. His brother Ba Gyan became the most celebrated cartoonist in Myanmar history, creating the nation's first animated films and comic books and receiving the prestigious Alinka Kyawswa title posthumously. Cartoonists continue to honor Ba Gyan with annual exhibitions on 13th Street in Yangon, where he once lived. Ba Than's other brother, U Sein, served as longtime editor of the anti-colonialist Myanma Alin newspaper. This family's collective contribution to education, journalism, literature, and art during the colonial and early independence periods reflects a shared commitment to Burmese cultural preservation and development.[^81][^82][^83]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Contemporary scholars and educators recognize Ba Than as a pioneering figure who made foundational contributions to Burmese education and historiography during a critical period in the nation's history. His creation of Myanmar Yazawin represented a watershed moment in Burmese educational development—the first comprehensive, accessible history textbook written in modern Burmese specifically for high school students. This achievement addressed a profound need in colonial Burma's educational landscape, where Burmese students had previously been forced to learn their history either through inaccessible classical texts or through British colonial narratives that portrayed Burmese civilization as inferior or primitive.[^84][^85]

Educational historians emphasize that Myanmar Yazawin played a crucial role in the nationalist school movement that emerged in response to colonial educational policies. Following the 1920 university strike, when students protested British educational reforms perceived as elitist and exclusionary, nationalist schools proliferated throughout Burma. These institutions needed textbooks that reflected Burmese values and perspectives rather than colonial viewpoints. Ba Than's textbook became a standard text in these schools, directly supporting the educational infrastructure of the independence movement. Scholars note that "history school textbooks helped arouse nationalism and keep national identity among the students, with U Ba Than's Myanmar Yazawin chosen for this purpose."[^86][^87]

Historians of education credit Ba Than with demonstrating that Burmese scholars could engage critically with both indigenous and Western sources to produce rigorous scholarship that honored traditional knowledge while meeting modern academic standards. His synthesis of Burmese chronicles (particularly the Hmannan Yazawin and Maha Yazawin) with British historical works represented an intellectual decolonization that paralleled political independence movements. By validating Burmese historical traditions while incorporating Western scholarly methods, Ba Than created a methodological model that influenced subsequent generations of Burmese historians.[^88][^89]

Scholars studying the evolution of history curricula in Myanmar recognize Myanmar Yazawin as part of the foundational period of modern Burmese historiography. Academic research on "A Textbook Case of Nation-Building: The Evolution of History Curricula in Myanmar" and "State-building, nationalism, and education in Myanmar" identifies Ba Than's textbook as representing an important early stage in using historical education to foster national identity and consciousness. These scholars acknowledge that while later textbooks would take more explicitly political approaches, Ba Than's work established the essential framework of presenting Burmese history in Burmese language for Burmese students.[^90][^91]

Defenders of Ba Than's legacy emphasize his personal sacrifices and dedication to education. Despite earning a B.A. from Rangoon College—an exceptional achievement that could have led to prestigious positions in colonial administration or lucrative professional careers—Ba Than chose to become a teacher in nationalist schools that often struggled financially. This decision exemplified the commitment to service and cultural preservation that characterized the nationalist movement's educational wing. His decades of teaching, combined with his years of research synthesizing historical sources, represented a life devoted to the proposition that education was essential to preserving Burmese identity and achieving independence.[^92][^93]

The longevity of Myanmar Yazawin—remaining in use for over two decades and published in eight editions between 1930 and 1952—testifies to its quality and relevance. That Ba Than's brother U Sein continued updating the text through Burma's independence demonstrates recognition of its enduring value. The text successfully served diverse educational contexts: colonial-era nationalist schools seeking to preserve Burmese identity, schools during the Japanese occupation period, and post-independence educational institutions building a new nation. This adaptability reflected the fundamental soundness of Ba Than's historical framework and pedagogical approach.[^94][^95]

Contemporary assessments of the nationalist school movement recognize the crucial role that educators like Ba Than played in preserving Burmese culture and fostering the consciousness that made independence possible. Research shows that "within the relatively small proportions of students they instructed, National Schools had a profound influence on their students' nationalist and anti-colonial outlook." Leaders including U Nu and Aung San, who attended nationalist schools, credited their political awakening to the education they received in these institutions. Ba Than's textbook contributed substantially to this educational environment that produced independence movement leaders.[^96][^97]

---

### Negative Views

Critical scholarly assessments of Ba Than's work acknowledge its pioneering importance while recognizing significant methodological and historiographical limitations that reflected both the constraints of his era and the inherent challenges of synthesizing traditional and colonial historical sources. The primary critique centers on Myanmar Yazawin's reliance on Burmese chronicles, particularly the Hmannan Yazawin and Maha Yazawin, which contain chronological inaccuracies and legendary material presented as historical fact. Later archaeological and epigraphic research revealed numerous dating errors, especially regarding the Pagan Dynasty and pre-Pagan periods, that Ba Than's textbook necessarily reproduced because this evidence was unavailable in 1929-1930.[^98][^99]

Contemporary historians employing more rigorous methodologies have questioned the uncritical acceptance of chronicle narratives that characterized early 20th-century Burmese historiography. The distinguished historian Than Tun, for example, developed approaches that moved beyond the "glorification of dynasties" common in pre-modern history studies, constructing instead "a strict, demonstrative methodology of history" based on careful evaluation of evidence. Scholars like Michael Aung-Thwin emphasized the need to "check the events, and the events only, as recorded in the various sources, rather than force them into a preconceived framework." From these perspectives, Myanmar Yazawin represents an early, valuable, but ultimately superseded stage in the development of Burmese historical scholarship.[^100][^101]

The Western historical works Ba Than consulted—particularly those by British colonial historians—carried inherent biases that potentially influenced his narrative framework. Colonial historians typically approached Burmese history through lenses that emphasized British civilizing missions, portrayed pre-colonial governments as despotic or chaotic, and interpreted historical developments as progression toward Western-style modernity and administration. While Ba Than attempted to balance these perspectives with traditional Burmese sources, critics argue that the very act of synthesis may have internalized some colonial assumptions about historical causation, political legitimacy, and cultural development.[^102][^103]

As a textbook designed for nationalist schools and used during the independence movement, Myanmar Yazawin served explicitly political purposes that potentially compromised its scholarly objectivity. Nationalist historiography typically emphasizes narratives supporting national identity—highlighting resistance to foreign domination, celebrating cultural achievements, and focusing on periods of unity and strength while potentially downplaying internal conflicts, regional diversity, and historical complexities that might complicate simple nationalist narratives. Critical scholars note that later Burmese textbooks "were written from a nationalist perspective and emphasised the story of General Aung San and other Burman heroes," and that even contemporary texts present narratives where "opposition to the British equals loyalty to a Myanmar nation that predates the colonists' arrival." While Ba Than's 1930 text preceded the most explicitly politicized versions, it established patterns that subsequent editions amplified.[^104][^105]

Some critics argue that Myanmar Yazawin's eventual obsolescence—falling out of use in schools after 1962—reflects not merely changing political circumstances but also the text's genuine scholarly limitations that became increasingly apparent as historiographical methods advanced. Archaeological discoveries, refined chronological frameworks based on epigraphic evidence, and more sophisticated analytical approaches developed between 1930 and 1962 rendered Ba Than's synthesis outdated. From this perspective, Myanmar Yazawin served an important transitional function but represented historical understanding that scholars have since substantially revised or superseded.[^106][^107]

The textbook's focus on political and dynastic history—reflecting both traditional chronicle emphases and early 20th-century historiographical norms—meant it provided limited coverage of social history, economic developments, the experiences of common people, women's history, and the diverse ethnic minorities that comprised Burma's population. This limitation, while characteristic of historical writing in Ba Than's era, meant that students using Myanmar Yazawin received a relatively narrow understanding of their past that emphasized kings, wars, and territorial changes while neglecting other dimensions of historical experience that contemporary historians consider essential.[^108][^109]

Critics also note that the colonial educational context in which Myanmar Yazawin operated involved compromises and limitations. While nationalist schools sought to preserve Burmese identity, they also needed to function within a colonial system that ultimately controlled educational accreditation, examination standards, and resource allocation. Ba Than's textbook, though written in Burmese and emphasizing Burmese perspectives, still operated within frameworks shaped by colonial power structures. Some scholars argue this inherent compromise limited how thoroughly nationalist education could challenge colonial epistemological domination.[^110][^111]

The post-independence evolution of Myanmar Yazawin, with U Sein's revisions extending coverage to 1948 and the text being adapted for nation-building purposes, raises questions about how Ba Than's original work was modified to serve changing political agendas. While these adaptations ensured the text's continued relevance, they also meant that the "Myanmar Yazawin" used in schools during the 1940s and 1950s was not purely Ba Than's work but a collaborative product shaped by his brother's revisions and the educational priorities of different historical moments. Critics argue this makes it difficult to assess Ba Than's specific contributions versus later modifications.[^112]
