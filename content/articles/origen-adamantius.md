## Summary

Origen of Alexandria was one of the most prolific and influential early Christian scholars. He produced the Hexapla, a monumental comparative study of biblical texts, and wrote extensive commentaries on nearly every book of the Bible. His theological speculations on the pre-existence of souls and universal restoration proved controversial. Despite later condemnation, his allegorical method of interpretation remained foundational for Christian exegesis.
