## Summary

Chen-Ning Yang is a Chinese-American physicist who shared the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics with Tsung-Dao Lee for their theoretical prediction that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. This discovery fundamentally changed understanding of symmetry in physics. He also made significant contributions to gauge theory through the Yang-Mills theory, which became a cornerstone of the Standard Model. Yang is considered one of the greatest living physicists.
