## 1. Introduction: The Price of Progress
**Minamata Disease** (*Minamata-byō*) is one of the "Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan." It is a severe neurological syndrome caused by methylmercury poisoning. For 36 years, the **Chisso Corporation** dumped toxic chemical waste into the sea, poisoning the food chain of an entire region. The tragedy is not just the poisoning, but the collusive cover-up by the corporation and the government, which silenced science and attacked victims to protect industrial growth.

## 2. The Mechanism of Poisoning
*   **The Chisso Factory:** Since 1908, Chisso was the economic heart of Minamata. In 1932, it began producing acetaldehyde (used to make plastics/PVC) using a **mercury sulfate** catalyst.
*   **The Reaction:** A side reaction produced **methylmercury**, a highly toxic organic compound. This was discharged directly into Minamata Bay without treatment.
*   **Bioaccumulation:** The heavy metal settled in the sludge. Plankton ate the sludge; small fish ate the plankton; large fish ate the small fish. At each step, the concentration of mercury exploded. When villagers ate the fish (their staple diet), the mercury attacked their central nervous system.

## 3. The Warning Signs: "The Suicide of Cats"
Before humans fell ill, the ecosystem screamed.
*   **early 1950s:** Fish floated dead. Crows fell from the sky.
*   **Dancing Cat Fever:** The local cats began to act insanely—salivating, convulsing, running in circles, and flinging themselves into the sea. Locals called it "cat dancing disease." By 1957, the cat population was wiped out.

## 4. The Human Outbreak (1956)
On April 21, 1956, a 5-year-old girl was examined at Chisso's hospital with baffling symptoms: difficulty walking, slurred speech, and convulsions. Her sister fell ill days later.
*   **Symptoms:** This "Strange Disease" caused ataxia (loss of muscle control), numbness in hands/feet, tunnel vision, and insanity. Victims shouted uncontrollably ("gaping") and died in comas.
*   **Congenital Minamata Disease:** The most tragic victims were babies. Pregnant women who had only mild symptoms gave birth to children with severe deformities, blindness, and cerebral palsy-like conditions. The placenta had actively filtered the mercury *out* of the mother and *into* the fetus.

## 5. The Corporate Cover-Up
Chisso acted with extreme malice to hide the truth.
*   **Dr. Hosokawa's Experiment (1959):** Dr. Hajime Hosokawa, the factory hospital director, secretly fed factory wastewater to "Cat 400." The cat developed the disease. Chisso management ordered him to stop the research and hid the results.
*   **The "Cyclator" Hoax:** In 1959, amidst protests, Chisso installed a "Cyclator" purification system. The Chisso president publicly drank a glass of water from it. It was a fraud; the machine removed sediment but **zero** dissolved mercury.
*   **Mimaikin (Sympathy Money):** Chisso paid desperate fishermen "sympathy money" (pennies) in exchange for signing contracts that renounced all future rights to sue.

## 6. Exposure: W. Eugene Smith
In 1971, the legendary American war photographer **W. Eugene Smith** and his wife Aileen moved to Minamata to document the victims.
*   **"Tomoko in Her Bath":** His photo of Ryoko Uemura bathing her grotesquely deformed daughter, Tomoko, became one of the most famous images in photojournalism history, comparing the victim to a Pietà.
*   **The Assault:** On January 7, 1972, at a meeting near Tokyo, Chisso-hired *yakuza* (goons) pulled Smith aside and beat him brutally. They smashed his head against concrete, nearly blinding him. This violence backfired, drawing global attention to Chisso's thuggery.

## 7. Resolution and Legacy
*   **1968 Acknowledgement:** The government finally admitted the cause was Chisso's waste—but only after Chisso had closed the acetaldehyde plant because it was outdated.
*   **1973 Verdict:** The courts ruled Chisso negligent.
*   **Certification Game:** To limit payouts, the government set extremely strict medical criteria. Of over 17,000 applicants, only roughly 2,200 were "certified" as victims.
*   **Minamata Convention (2013):** A UN Treaty to curb mercury pollution was signed in Kumamoto, named in honor of the victims.
