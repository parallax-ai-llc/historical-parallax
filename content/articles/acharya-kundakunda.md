Acharya Kundakunda was a Digambara Jain monk and philosopher who is one of the most revered figures in Jain philosophy. His works, including Samayasara (Essence of the Self), Pancastikayasara, and Pravacanasara, present a sophisticated analysis of the nature of the soul and reality. He developed the doctrine of the two standpoints (nishchaya naya and vyavahara naya) that became central to Digambara thought. He is considered the greatest mystic-philosopher of the Jain tradition.
