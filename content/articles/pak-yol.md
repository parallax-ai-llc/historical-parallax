## Summary

Pak Yol (February 3, 1902 – January 17, 1974) was a Korean anarchist and independence activist who became one of the most radical voices opposing Japanese colonial rule in Korea. Born as Pak Jun-sik in Mungyeong, he founded the Black Wave Society in 1921, the first Korean anarchist organization in Japan, and co-established Futei-sha (Society of Malcontents) with Japanese anarchist Kaneko Fumiko. Convicted of high treason in 1926 for conspiring to assassinate members of the Japanese Imperial family, he was sentenced to death but had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, serving 19 years before his release in 1945. After Korea's liberation, he was kidnapped to North Korea during the Korean War and died there in 1974.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Pak Yol was born on February 3, 1902, in Mungyeong, Gyeongsang Province (now North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea), into a destitute peasant family.[^3] His father worked the land amid the economic hardship typical of rural Korea during the Japanese colonial period, which began formally in 1910. Growing up in poverty under colonial oppression shaped Pak's early consciousness and instilled in him a deep resentment of Japanese imperialism and hierarchical power structures.[^4]

During his formative years, Pak attended Seoul Normal High School, a teacher-training institution in the Korean capital.[^5] This education provided him access to modern political ideas circulating among Korean intellectuals, including nationalism, socialism, and anarchism. The March First Movement of 1919—a nationwide series of protests demanding Korean independence from Japan—proved to be a pivotal moment in Pak's radicalization. He became involved in the movement, which saw two million people participate in 1,500 demonstrations across Korea, resulting in 7,500 killed, 16,000 wounded, and widespread destruction.[^6]

His involvement in the independence movement led to his expulsion from school in 1919 when authorities suspected him of anti-Japanese activities.[^7] Fleeing potential further persecution and seeking new opportunities to continue his education and revolutionary work, Pak relocated to Tokyo in October 1919.[^8] In Japan's capital, he enrolled in a work-study program and delivered newspapers to support himself financially while continuing his studies.[^9] This period of manual labor and interaction with Japanese society exposed him to the harsh discrimination faced by Korean migrant workers in Japan, further radicalizing his political consciousness and drawing him toward anarchist circles.

## Rise to Power

Upon arriving in Tokyo, Pak Yol immersed himself in radical student societies that were flourishing in Japan's relatively liberal Taisho-era political climate.[^10] Through these networks, he encountered influential Japanese leftist intellectuals, including the communist Hitoshi Yamakawa and the renowned anarchist Ōsugi Sakae, who became important mentors in his ideological development.[^11] These connections introduced Pak to anarchist theory and practice, which resonated with his anti-authoritarian instincts and his desire for Korean liberation through direct action rather than gradual reform.

In November 1921, Pak established the Black Wave Society (Heukdo/Kokutō kai) at a meeting in the home of Japanese anarchist Iwasa Sakutarō, making it the first Korean anarchist organization in Japan.[^12] Working alongside fellow Korean activists including Cho Bong-am, Kim Yaksu, and Kim Saguk, Pak became a leading figure within the organization and began editing its journal, *Black Wave*, which was first published in July 1922.[^13] In the inaugural edition, Pak articulated the journal's mission: to expose sympathetic Japanese people to the problems faced by Koreans within the Japanese Empire, with the ultimate aim of dissolving nationalist prejudices that divided the two peoples and establishing a cosmopolitan society through social revolution, mutual aid, and direct action against the state.[^14]

Between 1922 and 1923, Pak met Kaneko Fumiko, a Japanese woman who had experienced the brutality of Japanese colonialism firsthand during time spent in Korea, where she witnessed the mistreatment of Koreans by Japanese occupiers.[^15] Kaneko had been searching for a partner who shared her revolutionary vision, and after reading Pak's poetry in a socialist magazine, she hunted him down, took him to a Chinese restaurant, and proposed they become partners and equals in both life and political struggle.[^16] Their relationship was founded on three conditions: to live as comrades, for Fumiko to forget her femininity when it came to revolutionary action, and to cease cohabitation immediately if either cooperated with authorities.[^17]

Together, Pak and Kaneko co-founded Futei-sha (Society of Malcontents or "Irregulars Society") in 1922-1923, advocating nihilistic anarchism and direct action against imperial authority.[^18] The organization published journals addressing the challenges faced by Koreans under Japanese imperial rule and called for violent confrontation with imperialism rather than gradualist or electoral strategies.[^19] Pak's writings during this period emphasized personal rebellion over collective structures, rejecting all fixed ideologies, nations, and authoritarian frameworks as extensions of coercive power that stifled individual autonomy.[^20]

---

## Major Achievements

Pak Yol's most significant achievement was establishing and leading the first organized Korean anarchist movement in Japan during the 1920s, creating an ideological alternative to both nationalist and communist approaches to Korean independence. His founding of the Black Wave Society in 1921 provided a platform for Korean anarchists to articulate their vision of liberation through direct action, mutual aid, and the dissolution of all hierarchical structures, including both Japanese imperialism and potential Korean state authority.[^21]

Through the *Black Wave* journal and later publications associated with Futei-sha, Pak developed a distinctive anarchist philosophy that combined anti-colonial struggle with broader critiques of capitalism, militarism, and statism. In his 1922 article "An Example of Direct Action," Pak endorsed sabotage and assassination to shatter legal and imperial constraints without reliance on mass unions or traditional labor organizing.[^22] This represented a significant theoretical contribution to Korean independence thought, offering a radical alternative to the mainstream nationalist movement centered around the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.

Pak also distinguished himself through his critique of other political ideologies competing for influence within the Korean independence movement. In an article for a journal's fourth issue, he distinguished between politics and power, using the rise of the Bolsheviks to a "new privileged class" as an example of how revolutionary movements could reproduce oppression.[^23] To avoid creating such a new ruling class, Pak advocated for direct action against capitalism while rejecting both parliamentary politics and the trade unionism favored by other anarchists. This positioned him as an individualistic anarchist whose thought emphasized autonomous action over mass organization.[^24]

His collaboration with Kaneko Fumiko represented another major achievement: the creation of a genuinely transnational, anti-nationalist revolutionary partnership that challenged both Japanese imperialism and Korean ethnic nationalism. Together, they published materials that criticized Japanese Pan-Asianism, which Pak viewed as merely disguising the coercive invasion and colonization of Korea, while also disputing the very idea of an "Asian race" as a meaningful political category.[^25] This internationalist perspective distinguished Pak from many other Korean independence activists who grounded their resistance in ethnic nationalism.

Pak's willingness to take direct action against the Japanese imperial system, even at great personal cost, demonstrated the depth of his commitment to anarchist principles. His alleged plot to attack the Japanese Imperial family—whether real or exaggerated by authorities—represented the logical conclusion of his advocacy for revolutionary violence against oppressive power structures. This uncompromising stance made him a symbol of radical resistance that has continued to inspire anarchist and anti-authoritarian movements in Korea and beyond.[^26]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most significant controversy surrounding Pak Yol centers on the alleged bomb plot against the Japanese Imperial family. Following the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1, 1923, which killed over 105,000 people, false rumors spread that Korean residents in Japan were poisoning wells and carrying bombs, leading to a massacre in which more than 6,000 Koreans were murdered by vigilante groups, police, and soldiers.[^27] In this atmosphere of anti-Korean hysteria, Pak and Kaneko Fumiko were arrested without initial charges, as the Japanese government feared that Koreans would use the confusion to launch an uprising.[^28]

Authorities eventually charged them with high treason for allegedly plotting to obtain bombs to assassinate Emperor Taisho or Crown Prince Hirohito (later Emperor Showa) at Hirohito's wedding ceremony to Princess Nagako.[^29] The evidence for this conspiracy was thin, and Kaneko's confession appears to have exaggerated her role.[^30] Critics have argued that the charges were largely fabricated to justify the government's broader crackdown on Korean anarchists and to provide a post-facto rationalization for the Korean massacre. The timing of the arrests—immediately following the earthquake and massacres—suggests the case may have been politically motivated rather than based on a genuine threat.[^31]

Within the Korean independence movement, Pak's anarchist approach faced criticism from multiple directions. Nationalists associated with the Provisional Government viewed his rejection of Korean statehood as undermining the goal of national sovereignty. Pak diverged from some of his anarchist mentors in his adoption of Korean nationalism—he desired specifically the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule—which created tensions with pure internationalists who rejected all nationalist frameworks.[^32] Meanwhile, communists and socialists criticized his rejection of mass organizing and his emphasis on individual acts of terrorism, which they viewed as adventurism that could not build a sustainable revolutionary movement.[^33]

Pak's individualistic anarchism and emphasis on violent direct action also drew criticism from anarcho-syndicalists and other anarchists who favored building alternative institutions and workers' organizations. His disregard for trade unionism and the general strike as tools of anti-capitalist action alienated him from anarchists involved in the Korean labor movement.[^34] Some scholars have noted that his nihilistic philosophy, while philosophically consistent, offered limited practical guidance for building the mutual aid networks and confederated communities that other anarchists were establishing in Manchuria during the same period.[^35]

After his release from prison in 1945 and return to Korea, Pak's political activities in South Korea during 1945-1950 remain poorly documented, but his involvement with the Free Society Builders Federation and other anarchist groups appears to have been limited.[^36] His subsequent kidnapping to North Korea during the Korean War and his life under the communist regime—which would have been hostile to his anarchist ideology—resulted in him living in relative obscurity until his death.[^37] Some critics have questioned why he did not more actively resist or escape from North Korea, though the circumstances of his kidnapping and life there remain largely unknown due to the secretive nature of the North Korean state.

## Personal Life

Pak Yol's most significant personal relationship was with Kaneko Fumiko, the Japanese anarchist who became his partner, comrade, and eventually his wife. Kaneko, born in 1903, had experienced poverty and abuse throughout her childhood and had witnessed firsthand the brutality of Japanese colonialism during time spent in Korea.[^38] When she encountered Pak's poetry in a socialist magazine, she felt an immediate connection, later saying "every phrase gripped her."[^39] After meeting him for the first time and finding him to be "a very quiet guy but had an air of dignity," she pursued him relentlessly, eventually proposing their partnership over dinner at a Chinese restaurant with the words: "I've found what I have been looking for in you."[^40]

Their relationship was unconventional for the era, founded on principles of equality and mutual respect rather than traditional gender roles. The three conditions they established—to live as comrades, for Fumiko to forget her femininity when it came to action, and to cease cohabitation if either cooperated with authorities—reflected their shared commitment to anarchist principles in both political and personal life.[^41] They lived together as unmarried partners during their time as activists, which was scandalous in both Japanese and Korean society of the 1920s. Their partnership represented a genuinely transnational revolutionary collaboration that transcended ethnic boundaries, with a Japanese woman and Korean man united in opposition to Japanese imperialism.[^42]

While imprisoned and facing death sentences, Pak and Kaneko legally married a few days before their sentencing on March 25, 1926.[^43] This marriage formalized their relationship at the moment of greatest peril, demonstrating their commitment to each other despite facing execution. However, their time together was tragically cut short when Kaneko died in her solitary confinement cell at Utsunomiya Prison on July 23, 1926, at age 23.[^44] Japanese prison authorities officially ruled the cause of death as suicide by acute poisoning from an overdose of luminal (phenobarbital), though an alternative account claimed she hanged herself with hemp rope she had requested to weave.[^45] Her death occurred under suspicious circumstances, and many anarchists believed she had been murdered by prison authorities.[^46]

After Kaneko's death, Pak was relocated to Akita Prison in northern Japan, a facility notorious for its severe climate and use against political prisoners.[^47] He endured much of his remaining sentence—spanning over two decades—in solitary confinement, experiencing extreme isolation, stifling heat, poor ventilation, and physical punishments including beatings and kicks from guards.[^48] Little is known about Pak's emotional state during these years of imprisonment, though the loss of Kaneko and the harsh conditions undoubtedly took a severe toll.

Following his release in October 1945 by U.S. military occupation authorities, Pak returned to Korea and settled initially in the South.[^49] During this period from 1945 to 1950, he engaged with anarchist organizations such as the Free Society Builders Federation, though his activities are poorly documented.[^50] During the Korean War (1950-1953), he was kidnapped and taken to North Korea, where he spent the final 24 years of his life.[^51] Personal narratives from North Korea are notoriously difficult to obtain, and Pak never wrote memoirs for public reading, leaving his life in the North largely unknown.[^52] He died on January 17, 1974, at age 71, and was buried at the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery in Pyongyang, a national cemetery reserved for those who contributed to Korea's "liberation" and "socialist construction."[^53]

## Legacy

Pak Yol's legacy represents a complex and contested aspect of Korean independence history, embodying the radical anarchist current that existed alongside more prominent nationalist and communist movements. His establishment of the Black Wave Society and Futei-sha demonstrated that Korean resistance to Japanese colonialism encompassed diverse ideological perspectives, not just the ethnic nationalism typically emphasized in mainstream historical narratives.[^54] For scholars of Korean anarchism, Pak's leadership in early 20th-century groups, including the Korean Working Students' Group formed in 1919, exemplifies how radical ideologies fueled anti-colonial militancy and has influenced reevaluations of the independence movement's ideological diversity beyond Confucian or nationalist frameworks.[^55]

In contemporary South Korea, Pak's uncompromising anarchist stance against Japanese imperialism has shaped niche academic and activist narratives, portraying him as a symbol of direct-action resistance that prioritized individual liberty and collective self-organization over compromise with authority.[^56] His critique of all forms of hierarchical power—including potential Korean state structures—offers a unique perspective on liberation that challenges both the colonial oppressor and the nationalist alternative that eventually emerged in both North and South Korea. This makes him particularly relevant to contemporary movements that critique state power and advocate for horizontal, non-hierarchical forms of social organization.

Pak's partnership with Kaneko Fumiko has taken on symbolic significance as an example of transnational solidarity that transcended ethnic boundaries. Their relationship demonstrated that anti-colonial resistance could unite people across national lines in opposition to imperialism, offering an alternative to ethnic nationalism. Kaneko's death in prison became a rallying point for the anarchist movement, spurring many Korean anarchists to leave Japan and return to the Korean peninsula to continue their organizing work.[^57]

The 2017 South Korean film *Anarchist from Colony*, directed by Lee Joon-ik and starring Lee Je-hoon as Pak Yol, brought renewed attention to his story.[^58] The film's release sparked public interest in this lesser-known aspect of Korean independence history and introduced Pak's ideas to a new generation. The film's portrayal of Pak as a defiant, principled revolutionary who refused to submit to Japanese authority resonated with contemporary audiences, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions between South Korea and Japan over historical issues.[^59]

However, Pak's legacy is complicated by his final years in North Korea. His burial at the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery in Pyongyang represents the North Korean state's attempt to claim him as part of its revolutionary heritage, despite the fundamental incompatibility between his anarchist principles and the authoritarian communist regime.[^60] This appropriation of his legacy by a state he would have philosophically opposed highlights the ways historical figures can be instrumentalized for political purposes after their deaths.

In contemporary scholarship, Pak's writings and actions underscore enduring anarchist themes—popular revolt, mutual aid, and ethical naturalism—that challenge statist interpretations of Korean history and offer models for grassroots alternatives amid modern critiques of centralized power and economic hierarchy.[^61] His nihilist outlook, articulated through documents like the Nihilist Party Manifesto of 1926, which called for resolute action to "destroy the enemy by one stroke," continues to inspire radical activists who reject reformist approaches in favor of revolutionary transformation.[^62]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars of anarchism and Korean independence have praised Pak Yol for his uncompromising commitment to revolutionary principles and his role in expanding the ideological spectrum of anti-colonial resistance. Historians credit him with demonstrating that Korean liberation could be conceived in terms that transcended ethnic nationalism, instead emphasizing universal principles of individual freedom, mutual aid, and opposition to all hierarchical authority.[^63] His founding of the Black Wave Society represented a significant organizational achievement, creating the first Korean anarchist network in Japan and providing a platform for disseminating anarchist ideas among Korean expatriates and Japanese sympathizers.[^64]

Academic assessments of Pak's writings highlight his sophisticated critique of power that extended beyond simple anti-Japanese sentiment to encompass a broader analysis of capitalism, militarism, and state authority. His distinction between "politics" and "power" in analyzing the Bolshevik Revolution showed a theoretical sophistication that anticipated later anarchist critiques of Marxist-Leninist vanguardism.[^65] Contemporary scholars appreciate how his rejection of both Japanese imperialism and Korean nationalism offered a genuinely internationalist perspective that remains relevant to current debates about identity, sovereignty, and resistance.

Supporters of Pak's legacy emphasize his personal courage and willingness to sacrifice his freedom—and nearly his life—for his principles. His nearly two decades of imprisonment under harsh conditions, much of it in solitary confinement, demonstrated the depth of his commitment to the anarchist cause.[^66] The fact that he never recanted his beliefs or cooperated with Japanese authorities, despite opportunities to do so, has earned him respect even from those who disagree with his tactics or ideology. His partnership with Kaneko Fumiko is celebrated as an example of genuine solidarity that crossed ethnic and gender boundaries, embodying the universalist principles they both advocated.[^67]

Within Korean anarchist circles, both historical and contemporary, Pak is revered as a founding figure who established anarchism as a legitimate current within Korean political thought. His influence extended beyond his immediate followers to inspire later generations of Korean anarchists who established the autonomous Shinmin region in Manchuria from 1929 to 1931, demonstrating that anarchist principles could be practically implemented.[^68] Modern anarchists and anti-authoritarians in Korea cite Pak's example when arguing for alternatives to state-centered approaches to social organization and political resistance.[^69]

### Negative Views

Critics of Pak Yol have questioned the effectiveness of his tactics and the practical viability of his philosophical approach. His emphasis on individual acts of terrorism and rejection of mass organizing has been criticized as adventurism that could not build a sustainable revolutionary movement capable of actually overthrowing Japanese colonialism or constructing alternative social institutions.[^70] Communists and socialists contemporary to Pak argued that his approach represented a dead-end strategy that sacrificed dedicated activists without advancing the broader cause of Korean liberation. The fact that his alleged bomb plot resulted in his imprisonment without achieving any concrete blow to Japanese imperialism seemed to validate these criticisms.[^71]

Nationalist critics have argued that Pak's rejection of Korean statehood and his internationalist ideology undermined the Korean independence movement by denying the legitimacy of national self-determination. From this perspective, his critique of Korean nationalism as just another form of coercive power failed to recognize the progressive potential of anti-colonial nationalism and the importance of establishing Korean sovereignty as a prerequisite for further social transformation.[^72] The fact that Korea did eventually achieve independence through nationalist rather than anarchist movements has been cited as evidence that his approach was politically naive.

Some scholars have questioned whether the evidence against Pak and Kaneko was substantial enough to justify their convictions, suggesting that the plot may have been largely fabricated by Japanese authorities.[^73] If the conspiracy was indeed exaggerated or invented, then Pak's imprisonment would represent primarily a case of political persecution rather than a principled act of revolutionary terrorism. This interpretation complicates efforts to celebrate him as a martyr for direct action, instead portraying him as primarily a victim of Japanese repression who was imprisoned for his ideas and associations rather than concrete actions.

The circumstances of Pak's later life in North Korea have also drawn criticism and raised questions about his political judgment. Some have wondered why he did not attempt to escape or more actively resist being taken to the North, though the actual circumstances of his kidnapping remain unclear.[^74] His apparent acquiescence to living under a communist dictatorship that fundamentally contradicted his anarchist principles has been viewed by some as a compromise of his earlier radicalism, though others point out that he may have had little choice given the repressive nature of the North Korean regime and his advanced age at the time of his forced relocation.

Finally, critics have noted the limited concrete legacy of Pak's activism. Unlike other Korean independence activists who established enduring organizations, published extensively, or influenced the post-liberation political order, Pak's direct influence appears limited to a small circle of anarchists active primarily in the 1920s. His failure to produce substantial written works or memoirs means that his ideas are known primarily through brief articles and secondhand accounts, limiting scholars' ability to fully assess his intellectual contributions.[^75]
