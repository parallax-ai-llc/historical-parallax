## Summary

Apolinario de la Cruz (1815-1841), better known as Hermano Pule or "Brother Pule," was a Filipino religious leader who founded the Cofradía de San José (Confraternity of Saint Joseph) in 1832. Born to peasant parents in Lucban, Tayabas Province (now Quezon), he challenged Spanish colonial religious discrimination by establishing an exclusively indigenous Filipino religious brotherhood after being barred from joining Catholic religious orders due to his race. His movement attracted thousands of followers and culminated in armed resistance against Spanish forces in 1841, resulting in his execution at age 26. He is regarded as the first crusader for religious freedom in the Philippines and a proto-nationalist figure whose ideals influenced subsequent revolutionary movements.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Apolinario de la Cruz was born on July 22, 1815, in Barrio Pandác in the town of Lucban in Tayabas province (now Quezon) during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines.[^3][^4] His parents, Pablo de la Cruz and Juana Andrés, were peasants and devout Catholics, with some sources describing them as relatively well-to-do.[^5][^6] Growing up in a deeply religious environment, young Apolinario was described as "shy and religious" with a "magnificent dream to be a priest, so that he might be able to serve God and help his people to live the Christian way of life."[^7]

While Apolinario de la Cruz was literate, he stated that he had no formal education. However, it is very likely that he received primary religious instruction and attended the local public primary school in Lucban.[^8] His deep religious devotion and aspirations for the priesthood led him, in 1829 at age 14, to travel to Manila to pursue his calling. He attempted to join the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) to become a priest, representing the earnest hopes of a young indio (native Filipino) seeking to serve the Church.[^9]

The rejection he faced would prove to be a defining moment in his life and in Philippine history. Roman Catholic religious orders barred indios from joining during the Spanish colonial period, and De la Cruz's application was rejected for the sole reason of his race.[^10][^11] This racially discriminatory practice was widespread throughout the colonial religious establishment, which reserved membership in religious orders exclusively for Spaniards and sometimes mestizos, systematically excluding native Filipinos regardless of their piety or qualifications.[^12]

Following this rejection, the undaunted young man decided to work as a donado (lay brother) at the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Manila, where he was admitted to the Cofradía de San Juan de Dios, a brotherhood affiliated with the hospital that was open to indios.[^13][^14] During his time at the hospital, which lasted from 1829 to 1832, he improved his public speaking skills and studied the Bible along with other religious writings, deepening his theological knowledge and developing the charismatic leadership qualities that would later attract thousands to his cause.[^15][^16] This period of study and service would prove instrumental in preparing him for his future role as a religious leader and founder of his own confraternity.

## Rise to Power

In December 1832, 18-year-old Apolinario de la Cruz, along with Filipino secular priest Br. Ciriaco de los Santos and 19 other individuals from Tayabas, founded the Hermandad de la Archi-Cofradía del Glorioso Señor San José y de la Virgen del Rosario (Brotherhood of the Great Sodality of the Glorious Lord Saint Joseph and of the Virgin of the Rosary), shortened to Cofradía de San José (Confraternity of Saint Joseph).[^17][^18] The cofradía was established in direct response to the racially discriminatory practices of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, particularly the refusal of religious orders to admit native Filipinos as members.[^19] In retaliation against this systemic exclusion, De la Cruz established his own religious order that was exclusive for native Filipinos, creating a space where indios could practice their faith with dignity and autonomy.[^20]

The Cofradía initially existed as a small, unnoticed organization from its founding in 1832 until around 1840.[^21] In 1837, Apolinario de la Cruz appointed Octavio Ignacio "Purgatorio" de San Jorge as the "Hermano Mayor" (senior leader), while Filipino priest Ciriaco de los Santos was designated as the Chaplain and Treasurer. The confraternity was renamed Cofradía del Sr. San José i voto del Santísimo Rosario.[^22] Members of the cofradía met on the 19th of each month in honor of Saint Joseph, whose feast is March 19, and they paid monthly fees of one real to cover the cost of their monthly Masses and fiestas.[^23] Meetings were held with Mass said by Father Ciriaco de los Santos and thrilling sermons delivered by Hermano Pule.[^24]

Sometime in 1839 or 1840, the Cofradía's membership began to increase dramatically.[^25] In 1840, the Cofradía conducted a meeting in the house of Francisco de los Santos where the aims of the brotherhood were made public. Spanish authorities were unaware of the cofradía's existence until 1840.[^26] During its peak by 1841, the cofradía had grown to an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 members from the provinces of Tayabas, Batangas, and Laguna.[^27][^28] As early as 1833, Filipino priests noticed the cofradía's activities in the vicinity of Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw, areas that would become central to the movement's spiritual geography.[^29]

De la Cruz's charismatic leadership and eloquence attracted hundreds of followers to his religious movement.[^30] Hermano Pule continued to work at the San Juan de Dios Hospital and regularly corresponded with his followers through letters, which were read aloud to the cofradía members.[^31] In June 1841, Pule's petition to the Real Audiencia for official recognition of his cofradía was forwarded to Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri, who personally reviewed it and was disturbed by the rule excluding Spaniards and mestizos from joining without Pule's permission, leading him to believe it was a seditious organization using religion as cover for insurgence against Spanish authorities.[^32][^33] De Oraá then recommended Pule's dismissal from San Juan de Dios Hospital and had the cofradía outlawed in July 1841, ordering its disbandment and the arrests of its members.[^34][^35]

The Spanish colonial government's decision to suppress the cofradía transformed what had been primarily a religious movement into an armed resistance, as Hermano Pule and his followers prepared to defend their right to worship according to their own traditions and leadership.

## Major Achievements

Hermano Pule's most significant achievement was the establishment and successful growth of the Cofradía de San José, the first major indigenous Filipino religious organization that challenged Spanish colonial religious hegemony. By creating a religious brotherhood exclusively for native Filipinos, he provided a space where thousands could practice their faith with dignity, free from the racial discrimination that pervaded the colonial Catholic Church.[^36] The brotherhood fostered the practice of Christian virtues centered around the cults of Saint Francis of Assisi and the Virgin of Antipolo, while also incorporating elements of indigenous Filipino religious practices such as the use of anting-anting (talismans), creating a syncretic spiritual tradition that resonated with the local population.[^37]

Hermano Pule articulated four core goals for his movement: (1) meaningful change and social justice; (2) the right of Filipinos to religious freedom; (3) the ordination of "Seglar" (secular) Filipino priests; and (4) a fine brotherhood (Cofradía) to uplift the lives of the poor.[^38] His core teaching emphasized that through purity, the "old world" would die and a nobler one would take its place, manifesting itself through the cofradía.[^39] The 27-year-old Pule combined religious faith with patriotism in a manner that would inspire future generations.[^40]

The Cofradía developed unique religious practices and rituals. According to Hermano Pule's trial testimony, each member was required to attend mass and pray 7 "Our Fathers," 7 "Hail Marys," and 7 "Glorias" daily.[^41] The brotherhood developed a unique set of rituals and ceremonies that blended Catholic practices with indigenous Filipino traditions, including "journey on foot" practices that incorporated "frenzy" rituals and prayers.[^42] Initiation rites involved neophytes whispering "ancient prayers" and prostrating themselves on the dusty pavement of the church, asking for divine light and supernatural grace.[^43]

The Cofradía's teachings were structured around the dalit (hymns), which characterized a condition of perfection for the faithful once they ascended into heaven, placing "this condition of perfection as an image of possibilities of being, a horizon in view of which the members of the Cofradía could direct their daily activities."[^44] The brotherhood's teachings followed a tripartite structure of Dalit (light): beginning with brightness (innocence at the Garden of Eden), followed by darkness (Christ's passion and death), towards the luminous glory (of the Resurrection).[^45] This gradation, consciously and unconsciously, influenced the Katipunan that played a huge role in the Filipino struggle for independence at the turn of the century.[^46]

Hermano Pule demonstrated remarkable leadership in the face of Spanish military aggression. On October 23, 1841, alcalde mayor Joaquín Ortega led 300 men in an attack on the cofradía's camp, but the 4,000-strong cofradía was able to resist the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ortega and many of his men.[^47][^48] This victory against colonial forces represented a significant military achievement and demonstrated the strength of indigenous Filipino resistance when united by a common cause. Following this success, Pule transferred his camp to Alitao, near Tayabas town, where his followers crowned him "King of the Tagalogs," marking a symbolic assertion of indigenous sovereignty and self-determination.[^49][^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The Spanish colonial authorities viewed the Cofradía de San José with deep suspicion and hostility. Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri had the cofradía outlawed, thinking that it was a seditious organization.[^51] In addition to the fact that the cofradía only accepted natives, it was highly suspected that religion was used as a blind for political design and potential insurgence against Spanish authorities.[^52] The cofradía was accused of conducting heretical activities, and there was a rumor that the cofradía was planning to murder the alcaldes of Camarines and Laguna.[^53]

The Supreme Court of Spain acknowledged that the cofradía had committed an ecclesiastical offense for conducting religious activities without the approval of the Catholic Church.[^54] Colonial authorities confiscated "two large portraits of Hermano Pule depicted as a saint" during a raid in 1840, evidence that his followers venerated him in ways that the established Church considered blasphemous.[^55] A particularly harsh contemporary theological criticism emerged from conservative religious quarters: "Hermano Pule's Cofradia de San Jose was justly punished (inhumanely, but justly punished nonetheless) because of his subversive and heterodox teachings that promote hatred to authorities and to the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ."[^56]

However, modern scholars have challenged these negative colonial-era characterizations. Contrary to the Spanish authorities' paranoid view, these movements did not deliberately use religion as a cover for sinister political objectives.[^57] The court ultimately affirmed that Pule and the cofradía had no political motives, though they acknowledged the ecclesiastical offense.[^58] The cofradías' own self-understanding was far from radical in their religious practices, representing instead a genuine desire for indigenous spiritual autonomy.[^59]

The violent suppression of the Cofradía resulted in enormous casualties. On November 1, 1841, Colonel Joaquín Huet arrived in Tayabas with 800 to 1,000 soldiers. They initially offered amnesty to the members of the cofradía, with the exception of Hermano Pule and other senior leaders, but the cofradía refused. After four hours of fighting, a thousand rebels were killed in the encounter.[^60] The Spanish victors destroyed the rebel camp and chapel, captured Hermano Pule's flag and stored supplies and arms, and slaughtered more than 500 of his followers, including women and children.[^61]

The 1841 Alitao massacre became a public controversy in Manila. The Real Audiencia blamed De Oraá for failing to consult them before sending troops and for ordering "no quarter" to cofradía fighters, while De Oraá blamed Colonel Huet for allegedly exceeding orders.[^62] After investigation, the Supreme Court of Spain officially reprimanded Governor-General De Oraá for the excessive violence and disregard for proper legal procedures.[^63][^64] This official rebuke from Spain's highest court acknowledged that the colonial response had been disproportionate and legally questionable, even by the standards of colonial jurisprudence.

## Personal Life

Hermano Pule's personal life remains somewhat obscure in historical records, with most documentation focusing on his religious and revolutionary activities. He married a woman named Juana on May 15, 1840, in a ceremony performed by Fr. Ciriaco de los Santos, his co-founder of the Cofradía.[^65][^66] The couple had a son, though details about the child are scarce and historical records indicate the child "did not live too long to lead the Cofradia de San Jose."[^67] Hermano Pule was executed just over a year after his marriage, leaving limited time to develop a substantial family life.

Descriptions of his personality portray a man of deep religious conviction and remarkable personal qualities. He was described as "shy and religious" as a boy, with an earnest calling for the priesthood.[^68][^69] Despite facing racial discrimination and rejection, he was characterized as "undaunted" in pursuing his religious vocation.[^70] According to a film portrayal analysis, Hermano Puli "let such wounding, hurtful matters simply pass him by" and "it barely left a trace of anger, insult, indignation or ire on him," suggesting a forgiving and peaceful nature despite the profound injustices he experienced.[^71]

His charismatic leadership and eloquence were central to his ability to attract thousands of followers.[^72] He demonstrated gifts as a preacher, delivering "thrilling sermons" at monthly cofradía meetings.[^73] Hermano Pule's religious experiences and teachings often included mystical elements, as he reportedly experienced visions and claimed to receive divine revelations.[^74] His followers revered him so deeply that they created portraits depicting him as a saint, and after his death, members claimed to have witnessed apparitions of him alongside the Virgin of the Rosary.[^75]

While working as a donado at San Juan de Dios Hospital, he improved his public speaking and studied the Bible along with other religious writings, demonstrating intellectual curiosity and dedication to learning despite his lack of formal education.[^76] His theological understanding, while self-taught, was sufficient to challenge the established Church's practices and to develop a coherent religious vision that blended Catholic orthodoxy with indigenous Filipino spirituality.[^77] The Cofradía proposed that salvation could be achieved through prayers and that members must not rely upon the "indulgencia" (indulgences) as promised by the church, representing a proto-Protestant critique of Catholic practices.[^78]

## Legacy

Hermano Pule's death anniversary, November 4, is a holiday in Quezon province.[^79] Malacañang has declared November 4 a special non-working day in Quezon province to commemorate De la Cruz's death anniversary.[^80] Each year, local government leaders, military and police officials, and civic groups gather to offer flowers at De la Cruz monuments in Tayabas City and Lucban town.[^81] A monument to Hermano Pule now stands on the city boundary of Tayabas and Lucena, with commemorations held at the foot of the De La Cruz monument on Maharlika highway in Isabang village in Tayabas City.[^82][^83] The site includes the Apolinario dela Cruz historical marker and the Hermano Puli Memorial Shrine.[^84]

The surviving members of the Cofradía de San José, who lived in the vicinity of Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw, continued with their religious activities and became known as colorums, a corruption of the Latin phrase in saecula saeculorum ("unto the ages of ages"), which was used at Mass to end prayers.[^85][^86] During the American colonial era, the term colorum was applied to all the cults and insurgent groups characterized by Roman Catholic devotion, folk superstition, and hero worship. Some of these groups are still active today in various provinces in the Philippines.[^87] The Colorums were born out of the same ideas as Pule's cofradía; the name colorum itself comes from the mispronunciation of the Latin in their prayers.[^88]

Historians believe that Hermano Pule had connections with Father Pedro Pelaez, a prominent advocate of secularization—a movement to transfer church control from regular religious orders to secular (diocesan) priests.[^89] The narrative traces advocacy for equal rights among Filipino clergy against the dominance of Spanish friars, framed within the secularization movement sparked by events like the suppression of Hermano Pule's brotherhood and intensified by the Cavite Mutiny, leading to the execution of the GOMBURZA priests in 1872.[^90] According to historians, the heroism of De la Cruz inspired three Filipino priests—Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora—whose martyrdom provoked the people to rise against the tyranny of Spanish rule and fight for freedom.[^91]

It was said that his legacy paved the way for other secular priests to fight for their rights, which would eventually trigger a domino effect of events that would ultimately lead to the independence of the Philippines from Spain.[^92] Apolinario "Hermano Puli" de la Cruz founded the Cofradía de San José as early as the 19th century, which laid the seminal principles of the Filipino struggle for freedom and eventual democracy.[^93] This gradation, consciously and unconsciously, influenced the Katipunan that played a huge role in the Filipino struggle for independence at the turn of the century.[^94]

Quezon Governor Angelina Tan hailed the heroism and sacrifices of local hero Apolinario de la Cruz, popularly known as "Hermano Puli," for the freedom of religion in the country.[^95] He is considered the first crusader of religious freedom in the Philippines and led what is considered the first major religious revolt against Spanish colonial rule.[^96] While his rebellion was ultimately defeated, the ideals of equality, indigenous identity, and resistance to oppression that he championed continued to resonate long after his death.[^97]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship increasingly recognizes Hermano Pule as a proto-nationalist figure whose struggle transcended mere religious grievance to encompass broader themes of indigenous rights and self-determination. Historian Reynaldo Ileto's seminal work *Pasyon and Revolution: Popular Movements in the Philippines, 1840–1910*, first published in 1979, advanced a "history from below" approach that stressed the agency of the common man.[^98] Ileto traces the Philippine revolution against Spanish and American rule—from Hermano Pule's Confradía, through Andres Bonifacio's Katipunan and its reiteration after his death, to Felipe Salvador's Santa Iglesia.[^99]

Ileto centrally claims that it was in pasyon where the common people were able to give sense to the series of events transpired during those times, providing the "lowland Philippine society" the language through which their "values, ideals, and even hopes for liberation" were articulated.[^100] The publication of Ileto's work in 1979 produced a sea change in Philippine historiography, shifting the focus from the writings and actions of individual members of the elite to the perceptions and revolutionary participation of the lower classes.[^101]

Contemporary scholars emphasize that Hermano Pule's life and legacy represent a crucial chapter in Philippine history, illustrating the complex interplay of religion, politics, and social reform in the colonial era.[^102] In recent years, there has been a growing interest in reassessing Hermano Pule's place in Philippine history, with scholars and historians examining his life and teachings in greater detail, recognizing his significance as both a religious leader and a proto-nationalist figure.[^103] His struggle against Spanish colonial rule and religious discrimination became an important precursor to the broader Philippine nationalist movement that would emerge in the latter half of the 19th century.[^104]

His emphasis on indigenous spiritual practices and social equality resonated with many Filipinos and contributed to the development of a uniquely Filipino religious identity.[^105] As scholars continue to reassess his place in history, Hermano Pule's legacy remains an important subject of study for those seeking to understand the roots of Philippine nationalism and the ongoing struggle for social and religious equality.[^106] Academic studies such as "The Religious Experience of Hermano Puli's Cofradia and the Seeding of 1896 Philippine Revolution: a Kierkegaardian Reading" explore the philosophical and theological dimensions of his movement.[^107]

### Negative Views

Despite the growing scholarly appreciation, Hermano Pule remains underappreciated in mainstream Philippine historiography. There are many unsung heroes in Philippine history who have been ignored by the living generations because their achievements are not given proper recognition by historians and biographers.[^108] This observation suggests that Hermano Pule's contributions have been systematically undervalued in the dominant historical narrative, though recent scholarship is working to correct this oversight.

Critical scholarship has also challenged some interpretations of Hermano Pule's legacy. Regarding Reynaldo Ileto's influential work, critical re-examination argues that Ileto's attempt to reconstruct the categories of perception of "the masses" using the pasyon as source material was deeply flawed, treating the pasyon as a literary text and ignoring the significance of its performance.[^109] These methodological critiques suggest that some scholarly interpretations may have overextended their claims about the nature and extent of Hermano Pule's influence on later revolutionary movements.

Contemporary colonial critics and some modern conservative religious commentators continue to view Hermano Pule's movement with suspicion. The characterization of his teachings as "subversive and heterodox" persists in some quarters, particularly among those who prioritize ecclesiastical authority over indigenous religious expression.[^110] Spanish colonial authorities' suspicions that religion was used as cover for political insurgence have been echoed by some historians who question whether the Cofradía's religious character was genuine or strategic.[^111]

The violence associated with the Cofradía's suppression—including the deaths of Spanish officials like alcalde mayor Joaquín Ortega—complicates assessments of the movement.[^112] While modern scholars contextualize this violence within the framework of colonial oppression and legitimate resistance, contemporary observers and some later historians have characterized these events as evidence of the movement's dangerous radicalism. The fact that the Supreme Court of Spain affirmed that the cofradía had committed an ecclesiastical offense, even while acknowledging no political motives, demonstrates the complexity of legal and moral judgments surrounding Hermano Pule's actions.[^113]
