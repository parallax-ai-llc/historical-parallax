## Summary

Tahi Bonar Simatupang (T.B. Simatupang; 28 January 1920 – 1 January 1990) was an Indonesian military officer, theologian, and ecumenical leader who played pivotal roles in Indonesia's independence struggle and post-independence nation-building.[^1][^2] At age 30, he became one of the youngest chiefs of staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces, serving from 1950-1953.[^3] After his forced retirement following the controversial October 17, 1952 affair, he devoted the remainder of his life to Christian ecumenical work, serving as president of the World Council of Churches (1975-1983) and the Christian Conference of Asia (1973-1977).[^4] Declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 2013, Simatupang is remembered as both a brilliant military strategist and a profound Christian intellectual who bridged the worlds of warfare, politics, and theology.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Tahi Bonar Simatupang was born on January 28, 1920, in Sidikalang, Dairi Regency, North Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies, to a devout Batak Protestant family.[^6] His father, Simon Simatupang (with the title Sutan Mangaraja Soaduan), worked as a civil servant, while his mother was Mina Boru Sibuea.[^7] As the second of eight children, young Tahi Bonar grew up in a deeply Christian environment that would profoundly shape his worldview and future career.

The Batak people of North Sumatra had experienced extensive Christian missionary activity since the 19th century, and Christianity had become deeply integrated into Batak cultural identity by the time of Simatupang's birth.[^8] This Protestant background would later inform his unique perspective as both a military leader and Christian intellectual, distinguishing him from many of his Muslim contemporaries in the Indonesian nationalist movement.

Simatupang received a Dutch colonial education, which was available only to a small elite during the colonial period.[^9] He attended Dutch-language schools, where he demonstrated exceptional academic abilities. In 1937, at age 17, he moved to Jakarta (then Batavia) to pursue further education, exposing him to the growing nationalist movement in the colonial capital.[^10]

In May 1940, when the Netherlands was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Royal Dutch Military Academy (Koninklijke Militaire Academie or KMA) in Breda was evacuated to Bandung in the Dutch East Indies.[^11] Simatupang gained entry to this relocated military academy in 1941, studying in the engineering (zeni) division.[^12] Among his classmates were future Indonesian military leaders Abdul Haris Nasution and Alex Kawilarang, who would become his colleagues in Indonesia's revolutionary struggle.[^13]

In 1942, Simatupang graduated from the KMA with distinction, earning the title of crown cadet with a silver crown for his outstanding performance, particularly in theoretical subjects.[^14] A.E. Kawilarang later argued in his biography that if Simatupang had been Dutch rather than indigenous Indonesian, he would have received the gold crown—the highest honor.[^15] This academic excellence foreshadowed his future reputation as an intellectual among Indonesia's military leadership.

Shortly after his graduation, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the Dutch East Indies in early 1942, and the colonial government surrendered unconditionally on March 8, 1942.[^16] This Japanese invasion abruptly interrupted Simatupang's planned military career in the colonial army and thrust him into the tumultuous period that would eventually lead to Indonesian independence.

---

## Rise to Power

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945) created the conditions for Indonesian independence, though Simatupang's activities during this period remain less documented than his later revolutionary exploits. When Japan surrendered to the Allied forces in August 1945, Indonesian nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed independence on August 17, 1945, triggering the Indonesian National Revolution.[^17]

The Dutch refused to recognize Indonesian independence and sought to reestablish colonial control, leading to a four-year armed conflict and diplomatic struggle (1945-1949).[^18] During this revolutionary period, Simatupang emerged as one of the key military figures defending the fledgling Republic. As a colonel, he joined the Siliwangi Division in Central Java, one of the most effective military units of the republican forces.[^19]

The Siliwangi Division became legendary for its "Long March" (hijrah) from West Java when the Dutch occupied that territory, demonstrating the guerrilla warfare tactics that would characterize the Indonesian revolutionary struggle.[^20] Simatupang's Dutch military education combined with his understanding of guerrilla tactics made him invaluable to the republican cause. Together with Nasution, he helped develop the concept of "territorial warfare," which became fundamental to Indonesian military doctrine.[^21]

Simatupang's talents extended beyond battlefield command to diplomacy and strategy. From 1948 to 1949, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (WAKASAP) of the Republic of Indonesia.[^22] In this capacity, he was one of the Indonesian delegation members at the historic Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference (Konferensi Meja Bundar) held in The Hague from August 23 to November 2, 1949.[^23] This conference ultimately resulted in the Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on December 27, 1949.[^24]

A contemporary described Simatupang as "a Christian Batak with a Dutch education who helped lead a guerrilla war in the Javanese countryside, a man who while still in his twenties was simultaneously one of the principal founders of the Indonesian army and one of the key figures in four years of diplomatic negotiations with the Dutch."[^25] This unique combination of military prowess and diplomatic skill positioned him for rapid advancement in the newly independent nation.

When the revered General Sudirman—supreme commander of the Indonesian armed forces and hero of the revolution—died on January 29, 1950, at age 34, the nation faced a leadership crisis.[^26] Major General T.B. Simatupang, still only 29 years old, was selected as acting Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces.[^27] This appointment made him one of the youngest military chiefs in the world and reflected both his exceptional abilities and the trust he commanded among revolutionary leaders.

By 1951, Simatupang was formally appointed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (KSAP), a position he would hold until 1953.[^28] His youth, intellectual approach, and Christian background made him somewhat unusual among Indonesian military leadership, but his revolutionary credentials and strategic brilliance were undeniable.

## Major Achievements

As Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces from 1950-1953, T.B. Simatupang faced the enormous challenge of transforming irregular revolutionary guerrilla forces into a professional national military while navigating the turbulent politics of newly independent Indonesia. His tenure produced several lasting contributions to Indonesian military culture and national institutions.

**Military Professionalization and Demobilization**

Like Army Chief of Staff General Nasution, Simatupang was an "administrator" committed to reducing the size of the armed forces after independence to create a professional military rather than maintaining the bloated revolutionary army.[^29] Between 1947 and 1953, Indonesia underwent multiple phases of military reorganization, including demobilization and the incorporation of irregular troops into the standing army.[^30] The Indonesian Republican government planned to professionalize and reduce the army, turning it into a mobile strike force rather than a mass militia.

This professionalization effort was controversial and politically dangerous, as it required dismissing thousands of fighters who had sacrificed for independence but lacked the education or discipline for a modern military. Simatupang's commitment to this rationalization program, while strategically sound, created enemies among those facing demobilization.

**Creation of Sapta Marga and Military Oath**

One of Simatupang's most enduring contributions was his role in formulating the Sapta Marga (Seven Ways), the code of ethics for Indonesian military personnel, and the Sumpah Prajurit (Military Oath).[^31] Launched on October 5, 1951, coinciding with the 6th anniversary of the Indonesian National Army, Sapta Marga was designed to prevent divisions within the TNI from extreme left and right political influences.[^32]

Simatupang led the formulation process, working with Colonel Bambang Supeno, Mayor Guritno, and prominent national figures including Supomo, Ki Hajar Dewantara, and Husen Djajadiningrat.[^33] When the name "Sapta Marga" was proposed, Simatupang—as a Batak person—initially associated "marga" with "kinship group" (its meaning in Batak culture), though it was intended to mean "way of life" or "life guidance."[^34]

The Sapta Marga established principles including loyalty to Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution, defense of the nation, and ethical conduct that continue to guide the Indonesian military today. Simatupang's authorship of the Military Oath similarly established lasting standards for Indonesian military service.[^35]

**Military Doctrine and Strategic Thinking**

Simatupang contributed significantly to Indonesian military doctrine, particularly regarding guerrilla and territorial warfare. Together with Nasution, he was recognized as one of Indonesia's foremost military strategists.[^36] His 1961 book "Laporan dari Banaran: kisah pengalaman seorang pradjurit selama perang" (Report from Banaran: Experiences during the people's war), later translated into English by renowned scholar Benedict Anderson in 1972, documented his revolutionary experiences and strategic thinking.[^37]

The book provided valuable insights into guerrilla warfare from an Indonesian perspective and became an important historical document. Anderson's translation introduced Simatupang's thought to international audiences and established him as a military intellectual of international significance.[^38]

**Diplomatic and Intellectual Contributions**

Beyond purely military matters, Simatupang represented Indonesian military interests in diplomatic forums and contributed to broader national discussions about Indonesia's future. His ability to articulate Indonesian nationalist aspirations in terms comprehensible to Western audiences, combined with his understanding of both indigenous and colonial perspectives, made him an effective spokesperson for the young republic.

He explained that Indonesian nationalism emerged as "a reaction to Western colonialism and, at the same time, a continuation of the modernisation process that had previously happened in the West."[^39] His articulation of Pancasila as an inclusive civic nationalism that transcended religious and ethnic divisions reflected sophisticated political thinking.[^40]

**Building National Defense Infrastructure**

Simatupang played a major role in building Indonesia's military infrastructure during the crucial early independence period. He understood that Indonesia's defense needed to be strong to remain free from Dutch influence, and he worked to establish systems, training programs, and institutional structures that would outlast his own tenure.[^41] His vision of a professional, disciplined military answerable to civilian authority reflected his understanding of democratic governance, though this vision would face challenges in subsequent decades.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his significant achievements, Simatupang's military career ended in controversy, and his leadership faced substantial criticism both during his tenure and in historical assessments.

**Perceived Political Bias Toward the Socialist Party**

One of the most significant controversies surrounding Simatupang involved accusations of political bias. He was criticized for apparent favoritism toward the Socialist Party of Indonesia (Partai Sosialis Indonesia or PSI) after articles he wrote in 1952 were perceived as supporting this party.[^42] For a military chief of staff to show political preference violated expectations of military neutrality in political affairs and raised concerns about military interference in democratic processes.

The PSI was a small, Western-oriented, intellectual party that attracted educated Indonesians, including many with Dutch colonial education similar to Simatupang's background. Critics suggested that Simatupang's support for PSI reflected class bias and insufficient commitment to revolutionary populism.

**The October 17, 1952 Affair**

The most damaging controversy of Simatupang's career was his involvement in the October 17, 1952 affair, a military show of force against civilian government that effectively ended his career.[^43] The crisis arose from disputes over military reorganization and demobilization, which had created tensions between military leadership and parliament.

Following the dismissal of Colonel Bambang Supeno—who opposed the reorganization plans—parliament began issuing demands to restructure the Indonesian Army's leadership and the Ministry of Defense, particularly targeting Simatupang and Army Chief of Staff Nasution.[^44] The military leaders viewed this as unacceptable civilian interference in military affairs.

On the morning of October 17, 1952, thousands of demonstrators—brought to Jakarta by army trucks—arrived in front of the parliament building demanding its dissolution.[^45] Simultaneously, Nasution and Simatupang mobilized troops in a show of force, surrounding the Presidential Palace and pointing tank turrets at it.[^46] They demanded that President Sukarno dissolve the parliament.

This was nothing less than an attempted coup or, at minimum, military intimidation of civilian authority. While Sukarno resisted the pressure and refused to dissolve parliament, the incident fundamentally damaged civil-military relations and ended Simatupang's career. On November 4, 1953, his post as chief of staff was abolished, effectively dismissing him.[^47] In December 1952, both he and Nasution lost their positions and were suspended from service.[^48]

**Authoritarian Tendencies**

Critics have argued that the October 17 affair revealed authoritarian tendencies among Indonesia's military leadership, including Simatupang. Despite his reputation as an intellectual and his later democratic rhetoric, his willingness to use military force to pressure elected civilian authorities suggested a problematic view of military prerogatives in democratic governance.

This incident foreshadowed the Indonesian military's growing political role in subsequent decades, culminating in Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime. While Simatupang himself did not participate in later military authoritarianism, his actions in 1952 contributed to establishing precedents for military intervention in politics.

**Elite Background and Class Bias**

Some critics have noted that Simatupang's Dutch colonial education and Batak Protestant background distanced him from the predominantly Muslim masses who formed the backbone of the independence movement. His commitment to military professionalization, while strategically sound, meant demobilizing thousands of revolutionary fighters, many from poor rural backgrounds, which could be interpreted as elitism.

His association with Western-educated intellectuals and the PSI reinforced perceptions that he represented a Westernized elite more comfortable with colonial-era structures than with revolutionary transformation of Indonesian society.

**Controversial Demobilization Policies**

Simatupang's aggressive pursuit of military professionalization through demobilization created substantial hardship for veterans who had sacrificed for independence only to find themselves unemployed in the new Indonesia. While these policies may have been necessary for creating an effective modern military, they also reflected insufficient concern for the social consequences of rapid demobilization.

---

## Personal Life

On December 12, 1948, during the revolutionary period, Simatupang married Sumiarti Budiardjo, the sister of Ali Budiardjo, who later served as Indonesia's Minister of Information.[^49] This marriage connected him to another prominent Indonesian political family. The couple was blessed with four children, though details about their names and lives remain largely private.[^50]

As the second of eight siblings, Simatupang maintained connections with his extended Batak family throughout his life.[^51] The Batak people have strong kinship traditions, and these family ties likely provided important support networks during his turbulent military and post-military careers.

Simatupang's Protestant Christian faith was central to his identity and worldview. Unlike many Indonesian nationalists who came from Muslim backgrounds or adopted secular ideologies, Simatupang openly integrated his Christian convictions with his nationalist commitments.[^52] This made him somewhat unusual in Indonesian political life, where Christianity was a minority religion, though Protestant Christianity was well-established among the Batak people of North Sumatra.

Contemporary accounts describe Simatupang as an intellectual who was more comfortable with books and ideas than with typical military culture. His combination of military professionalism with intellectual curiosity and theological depth created a distinctive personality. He was known for his ability to bridge different worlds—indigenous and Dutch, military and civilian, nationalist and Christian, Indonesian and international.

After his forced retirement from military service in 1953, at age 33, Simatupang faced the challenge of reinventing himself. Rather than pursuing business opportunities or political office—common paths for former military officers—he devoted himself to religious duties and writing.[^53] This choice reflected both his genuine Christian commitment and perhaps also his disillusionment with Indonesian politics after the October 17 affair.

His post-military years were characterized by intensive intellectual and theological work. He authored numerous articles and books in Indonesian, some of which were translated into other languages.[^54] His writings addressed Christian mission in Indonesia, theology in the Indonesian context, and the relationship between Christian faith and Pancasila ideology. Notable works included "Iman Kristen dan Pancasila" (Christian Faith and Pancasila) and "Kehadiran Kristen dalam perang, revolusi, dan pembangunan: berjuang mengamalkan Pancasila dalam terang iman" (Christian Presence in War, Revolution, and Development: Struggling to Practice Pancasila in the Light of Faith).[^55]

Simatupang's personality combined intellectual rigor with practical engagement. Unlike some intellectuals who remained in ivory towers, he actively participated in organizational leadership and sought to apply theological insights to concrete social and political challenges. His ability to work across cultural and religious boundaries made him an effective ecumenical leader on the international stage.

## Legacy

T.B. Simatupang died in Jakarta on January 1, 1990, the first day of a new decade, at age 69.[^56] He was buried at Taman Makam Pahlawan Kalibata, Indonesia's heroes' cemetery, reflecting recognition of his contributions to Indonesian independence even before his official designation as a National Hero.[^57]

**National Hero Designation**

On November 8, 2013, more than two decades after his death, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono formally declared T.B. Simatupang a National Hero of Indonesia (Pahlawan Nasional), along with Rajiman Wediodiningrat and Lambertus Nicodemus Palar.[^58] The awards ceremony at the State Palace, held two days before National Heroes Day, officially recognized Simatupang's contributions to Indonesian independence and nation-building.[^59]

The National Hero designation acknowledged both his military role during the revolution and his later contributions to Indonesian Christianity and international ecumenical relations. It represented a reconciliation with his controversial forced retirement in 1953, recognizing that his overall contributions outweighed the October 17 affair.

**Commemoration in Currency and Place Names**

Simatupang's legacy is perpetuated through various forms of commemoration. On December 19, 2016, the Indonesian government honored him by featuring his portrait on the new 500 rupiah coin.[^60] The coin's obverse features the national emblem (Garuda Pancasila) and Simatupang's portrait with the lettering "REPUBLIK INDONESIA LETJEN TNI T. B. SIMATUPANG."[^61]

His name has been immortalized as a major street in Jakarta, with Jalan T.B. Simatupang running through the Cilandak area of South Jakarta to Cipayung in East Jakarta.[^62] This prominent street name ensures that millions of Jakarta residents encounter his name regularly, keeping his memory alive in daily life.

**Military Legacy**

Within the Indonesian military (TNI), Simatupang is remembered as one of the founding figures who transformed revolutionary guerrilla forces into a professional national army. The Sapta Marga and Military Oath that he helped formulate continue to guide TNI personnel today, making his influence ongoing rather than merely historical.[^63]

His emphasis on territorial warfare and his strategic thinking about Indonesian defense established principles that remain relevant. Together with Nasution, he is considered one of Indonesia's foremost military strategists, and his writings continue to be studied in Indonesian military education.[^64]

**Ecumenical and Theological Legacy**

In Christian circles, particularly within Indonesian Protestantism and international ecumenical organizations, Simatupang is remembered as a pioneering lay theologian who articulated distinctively Asian and Indonesian theological perspectives. His service as president of the World Council of Churches (1975-1983) and the Christian Conference of Asia (1973-1977) brought Indonesian Christian voices to global prominence.[^65]

His theological work on the relationship between Christian faith and Indonesian nationalism, particularly his integration of Christian commitment with Pancasila ideology, provided intellectual foundations for Christian participation in Indonesian national life. His writings demonstrated that Christianity and Indonesian nationalism were compatible, countering narratives that portrayed Christianity as inherently foreign or colonial.

**Intellectual and Literary Legacy**

Simatupang's books, particularly "Report from Banaran" translated by Benedict Anderson, remain important historical sources for understanding the Indonesian revolution from a participant's perspective.[^66] His autobiography "The Fallacy of A Myth" and his numerous theological writings provide insights into Indonesian intellectual history during the critical mid-20th century period.

The T.B. Simatupang Memorial Lecture, held periodically, continues his intellectual legacy by bringing together scholars and leaders to discuss issues of national development, Pancasila, and Christian engagement with Indonesian society.[^67]

**Complex Historical Assessment**

Simatupang's legacy remains complex and contested. He is simultaneously remembered as a brilliant strategist and an officer who threatened civilian government; as a champion of professionalization and as someone who dismissed revolutionary veterans; as a Christian intellectual who bridged worlds and as an elite figure distant from ordinary Indonesians.

This complexity ensures continued historical interest in his life and contributions. He represents both the promises and the challenges of Indonesia's early independence period—a time of idealism and nation-building, but also of political instability and civil-military tensions that would shape Indonesian history for decades.

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers emphasize multiple dimensions of Simatupang's positive contributions to Indonesian history and international ecumenical Christianity. His supporters argue that his legacy encompasses military, theological, and intellectual achievements that few individuals could match.

**Military Professionalism and Strategic Brilliance**

Historians credit Simatupang with helping to establish professional standards for the Indonesian military during its formative years. His commitment to transforming irregular revolutionary forces into a disciplined, professional army, while politically costly, was strategically necessary for Indonesia's long-term security.[^68] His work with Nasution on territorial warfare doctrine provided Indonesia with military concepts suited to the archipelago's geography and political circumstances.

Cornell University's memorial tribute noted his role as "one of the principal founders of the Indonesian army" while still in his twenties, highlighting his exceptional early achievements.[^69] His participation in the Round Table Conference demonstrated his diplomatic skills and his ability to represent Indonesian interests effectively in international forums.

**Principled Stand Against Political Extremism**

Defenders of Simatupang argue that his formulation of Sapta Marga was designed to protect the military from political extremism, both communist and Islamic.[^70] In the context of the early 1950s, when Indonesia faced threats from both the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and various Islamic rebellions, establishing a non-partisan military identity grounded in Pancasila was crucial for national unity.

His alleged favoritism toward the PSI can be interpreted not as partisan bias but as support for rational, democratic governance against extremist alternatives. The PSI, despite being small, represented modernist, democratic values that Simatupang believed were essential for Indonesia's development.

**Pioneering Christian-National Integration**

Theologians and church historians celebrate Simatupang as a pioneering figure who demonstrated that Christians could be fully Indonesian nationalists while maintaining their faith commitments.[^71] At a time when Christianity was often associated with colonialism, Simatupang's revolutionary credentials and nationalist commitment provided a model for Christian participation in Indonesian national life.

His theological writings on Christian presence in Indonesian society and his integration of Christian faith with Pancasila ideology helped establish intellectual foundations for Christian-Muslim coexistence in Indonesia. His work countered both secular exclusion of religion from public life and Islamic arguments for Islamic state models.

**International Ecumenical Leadership**

International Christian leaders recognize Simatupang's contributions to global ecumenism. His presidency of the World Council of Churches brought Asian and particularly Indonesian perspectives to global Christian conversations.[^72] He was "noted as a speaker and writer on social ethics and ecumenical concerns in Indonesia and in other Asian countries and in the West."[^73]

His ability to articulate distinctively Asian theological perspectives while engaging constructively with Western Christianity helped decolonize Christian theology and gave voice to churches in the Global South. His leadership in the Christian Conference of Asia similarly promoted Asian Christian solidarity and independence from Western ecclesiastical control.

**Intellectual Depth and Literary Contributions**

Scholars appreciate Simatupang's intellectual contributions, particularly "Report from Banaran," which Benedict Anderson considered valuable enough to translate and introduce to English-speaking audiences.[^74] The book provides insider perspectives on the Indonesian revolution that remain valuable for historical research.

His numerous writings on theology, military strategy, and national development demonstrate intellectual range unusual among military figures. The continuing T.B. Simatupang Memorial Lectures testify to the ongoing relevance of his ideas.[^75]

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptical historians emphasize Simatupang's role in undermining civilian democratic authority and question whether his contributions justify his controversial actions and their long-term consequences for Indonesian democracy.

**Undermining Civilian Democracy**

The most serious criticism focuses on Simatupang's participation in the October 17, 1952 affair. Critics argue that pointing tanks at the presidential palace and mobilizing troops to pressure civilian authorities was an inexcusable assault on democratic governance.[^76] Regardless of the legitimacy of military concerns about parliamentary interference, using military force against civilian authority violated fundamental democratic principles.

Some historians argue that this incident established dangerous precedents for military intervention in politics that enabled later authoritarian developments, including Suharto's New Order regime. While Simatupang himself did not participate in later military authoritarianism, his actions in 1952 normalized military pressure on civilian government.[^77]

**Elite Bias and Insufficient Revolutionary Commitment**

Critics point to Simatupang's Dutch colonial education, his Christian minority background, and his association with the Western-oriented PSI as evidence of insufficient identification with ordinary Indonesians.[^78] His aggressive demobilization policies, while perhaps strategically sound, showed insufficient concern for the welfare of revolutionary veterans whom he dismissed from service.

His intellectual, bureaucratic approach to military leadership contrasted with the populist, charismatic leadership of figures like Sudirman, whom ordinary soldiers revered. Some historians suggest that Simatupang represented a colonial-educated elite that never fully embraced revolutionary transformation of Indonesian society.

**Partisan Political Involvement**

Despite his rhetoric about military professionalism and non-partisanship, Simatupang's writings supporting the PSI demonstrated that he was not above political partisanship.[^79] This undermined his credibility when formulating supposedly non-partisan principles like Sapta Marga and raised questions about whether these principles actually reflected particular political biases disguised as neutral professionalism.

**Authoritarian Tendencies**

Critics argue that Simatupang's actions revealed authoritarian tendencies inconsistent with his later democratic rhetoric. His willingness to use military force to override parliamentary decisions suggested that he believed military judgment should supersede civilian democratic processes when the two conflicted.[^80]

This attitude, shared with many military leaders of his generation, reflected insufficient commitment to democratic principles and contributed to the military's inflated sense of its prerogatives in Indonesian governance.

**Limited Impact of Theological Work**

Some critics question whether Simatupang's theological contributions were as significant as his admirers claim. While he held prominent positions in international ecumenical organizations, his actual influence on theological discourse may have been limited. His integration of Christianity with Pancasila, while politically useful, may not have constituted profound theological innovation.

Critics also note that despite his ecumenical work, Christian-Muslim tensions persisted in Indonesia, and in some regions worsened over time, suggesting limits to his success in promoting religious harmony.

**Contested Legacy**

Historians note that Simatupang's National Hero designation came 23 years after his death and only after considerable debate, suggesting that his legacy remained controversial even in the early 21st century.[^81] His commemoration focuses primarily on his military and ecumenical contributions while downplaying his forced retirement and the circumstances surrounding it, suggesting incomplete historical reckoning with his controversial actions.
