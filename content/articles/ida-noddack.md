## Summary

Ida Noddack (née Tacke) co-discovered the element rhenium in 1925 and was the first to suggest the concept of nuclear fission in 1934 — four years before Hahn and Meitner confirmed it experimentally. Her suggestion that heavy nuclei could break into smaller pieces was dismissed by the scientific community but later proven correct.
