## Summary

Adnan Menderes served as the ninth Prime Minister of Turkey from 1950 to 1960, becoming the country's first democratically elected leader following decades of single-party rule.[^1] His decade in power transformed Turkey's economy, achieving annual growth rates of 9%, while modernizing infrastructure through Marshall Plan aid and pursuing pro-Western foreign policies, including NATO membership in 1952.[^2] Despite these achievements, his government faced accusations of authoritarianism, presided over the 1955 Istanbul pogrom against Greek minorities, and ultimately succumbed to economic crisis.[^3] Following the military coup of May 27, 1960, Menderes was convicted by a military tribunal and executed by hanging on September 17, 1961, becoming one of the most controversial and polarizing figures in modern Turkish history.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Adnan Menderes was born in 1899 in Koçarlı, a town in the province of Aydın in western Anatolia, into a wealthy landowning family of Crimean Tatar origin.[^5] His father was Katipzade İbrahim Ethem Bey from İzmir, and his mother was Tevfika from the Hacı Alipaşazade family of Aydın.[^6] His grandfather, Hacı Ali Pasha, was a Crimean Tatar who had emigrated to Tire from Eskişehir, establishing the family's considerable wealth through agricultural landholdings.[^7]

Tragedy struck young Menderes early in life when he lost his parents and sister during his childhood, leaving him orphaned at age nine.[^8] He was subsequently raised by his grandmother, who oversaw his early education and upbringing. With the inheritance of the Çakırbeyli Farm in Aydın from Hacı Ali Pasha, Menderes became a young but lonely landowner, managing extensive agricultural estates despite his youth.[^9] This early experience with solitude and responsibility would shape his character, instilling in him both independence and a deep connection to rural Turkey's landowning class.

Menderes received his primary education locally before attending the prestigious Kızılçullu American College in İzmir, where he was exposed to Western educational methods and liberal ideas.[^10] During World War I (1914-1918), he was trained as a reserve officer but did not participate in combat due to illness.[^11] Following the war, as Greece occupied parts of western Anatolia, Menderes fought against the invading Greek army during the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923), demonstrating his nationalist credentials and earning a medal of honor for his service.[^12] After the establishment of the Turkish Republic, he pursued higher education at Ankara University Law School, graduating with a law degree that would later serve his political career.[^13]

In 1928, Menderes married Fatma Berin (also known as Berrin), whose family had strong political connections.[^14] This marriage proved pivotal, as with support from his mother-in-law, Menderes entered political circles and became involved in movements led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey.[^15] Later in life, he demonstrated progressive attitudes toward land ownership, selling or distributing most of his inherited estates to small shareholders while maintaining only one farm, which he transformed into a model of modern agricultural methods.[^16] Beyond politics, Menderes was interested in football, initially playing for Karşıyaka Club until he was booed by fans after missing a scoring opportunity, then serving as a goalkeeper for Altay.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Adnan Menderes entered the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1930 as a member of Kemal Atatürk's Republican People's Party (RPP or CHP), the only legal political party in Turkey at that time.[^18] For fifteen years, he served as a loyal party member within the single-party system that had governed Turkey since the republic's founding in 1923. However, by the mid-1940s, as Turkey faced pressure to democratize following World War II and sought alignment with Western democracies, Menderes became increasingly critical of the CHP's authoritarian structure and its resistance to political liberalization.[^19]

In 1945, Menderes and three other CHP parliamentarians—Celal Bayar, Refik Koraltan, and Fuat Köprülü—signed a motion criticizing party regulations and advocating for greater democratic freedoms.[^20] The four dissidents were promptly expelled from the CHP for their insubordination. Undeterred, they founded the Democrat Party (DP) on January 7, 1946, establishing Turkey's fourth legal opposition party and the first credible challenge to the CHP's monopoly on power.[^21] The formation of the DP marked a watershed moment in Turkish political history, offering voters an alternative to the Kemalist establishment that had governed without interruption for over two decades.

In the four years leading up to the 1950 elections, the Democrat Party positioned itself as the champion of the Turkish people, particularly appealing to rural populations, small business owners, and religious conservatives who felt marginalized by the CHP's secular, statist, and urban-oriented policies.[^22] The DP campaigned on a platform of economic liberalization, greater religious freedom, and an end to single-party authoritarianism. Menderes proved to be a charismatic campaigner, connecting with ordinary Turks through his landowning background and his promises to restore the Arabic call to prayer (adhan), which had been banned under Kemalist reforms.[^23]

The general elections held on May 14, 1950, resulted in a landslide victory for the Democrat Party, which secured 416 of the 487 parliamentary seats with 52-55% of the popular vote.[^24] The elections were hailed as the first truly free elections in Turkish history, with votes cast in secret and counted openly.[^25] The peaceful transfer of power from the CHP to the DP on May 22, 1950, marked the beginning of competitive multi-party politics in Turkey. Celal Bayar was elected president, and on the same day, Adnan Menderes was appointed Prime Minister, forming Turkey's first democratically elected government.[^26] Menderes's rise from opposition dissident to prime minister in just four years demonstrated both his political acumen and the Turkish people's hunger for democratic change after 27 years of single-party rule.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Adnan Menderes's decade as Prime Minister witnessed remarkable economic growth and modernization that transformed Turkey's infrastructure and international standing. Between 1950 and 1954, the Turkish economy expanded at an extraordinary annual growth rate averaging 9%, driven by liberal economic policies that encouraged private enterprise and foreign investment.[^28] Menderes pursued a more market-oriented approach than his predecessors, lowering interest rates, facilitating private sector access to credit, and reducing state control over economic activity.[^29]

The cornerstone of Menderes's economic success was Turkey's participation in the Marshall Plan, through which the country received approximately $2.5 billion in loans and aid from the United States.[^30] These funds financed massive infrastructure development projects that revolutionized Turkey's physical landscape. The Menderes government constructed approximately 40,000 kilometers of highways and 30,000 kilometers of village roads during the 1950s, connecting rural communities to urban markets and dramatically improving transportation networks.[^31] The administration also established numerous electricity plants, expanding power generation and bringing electricity to previously unserved regions.[^32]

Agricultural development represented another major achievement, with Menderes's policies focusing heavily on mechanization and infrastructure investment in rural areas.[^33] Agricultural production rose by over 50% between 1950 and 1954, benefiting from mechanization programs, improved irrigation, and American technical assistance.[^34] The peasantry of Turkey, which constituted approximately 80% of the population, appreciated Menderes's premiership for delivering tangible improvements to their livelihoods after decades of being excluded or marginalized by Kemalist reforms.[^35] This agricultural success helped secure the DP's continued electoral dominance and cemented Menderes's popularity among rural voters.

In foreign policy, Menderes aligned Turkey firmly with the Western bloc during the Cold War. At a cabinet meeting on July 25, 1950, his government made the historic decision to send Turkish military forces to support the United Nations coalition in the Korean War.[^36] More than 5,000 Turkish soldiers were deployed to Korea, with 741 losing their lives and over 2,000 wounded in combat.[^37] This military commitment demonstrated Turkey's reliability as a Western ally and proved instrumental in securing NATO membership. Turkey officially joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in February 1952, achieving a strategic goal that enhanced the country's security and international prestige.[^38]

Menderes also pursued policies of greater religious tolerance compared to the stringent secularism of the Kemalist era. He legalized the Arabic Islamic call to prayer (adhan), which had been banned and replaced with a Turkish translation, responding to widespread popular demand among the Muslim majority.[^39] His government relaxed restrictions on religious education and expression, making space for traditional Islamic practices within the framework of the secular republic. Additionally, Menderes worked constructively with Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis to resolve tensions over Cyprus, culminating in the Zurich Agreement of February 1959, which established the framework for an independent Republic of Cyprus with provisions protecting Turkish Cypriot interests.[^40]

The banking, insurance, education, and healthcare sectors all progressed significantly under Menderes's tenure, supported by American aid and economic liberalization.[^41] His government's accomplishments in modernizing Turkey's economy and infrastructure, integrating the country into Western security structures, and delivering prosperity to rural populations represented genuine achievements that transformed Turkey's development trajectory and earned him enduring popularity among large segments of Turkish society.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Adnan Menderes's government faced severe criticisms and engaged in increasingly authoritarian practices that undermined democratic norms. As economic difficulties mounted in the mid-1950s, the DP responded first with inflationary policies, and when those failed, with authoritarianism and populism.[^42] The party took an increasingly autocratic turn as it consolidated power, provoking fears that the democratic system had merely given rise to an elective dictatorship.[^43] Critics accused Menderes of systematically dismantling checks and balances to suppress opposition and maintain power.

The most notorious controversy of Menderes's tenure was the Istanbul pogrom of September 6-7, 1955, a state-sponsored campaign of violence against the city's Greek minority.[^44] The pogrom was orchestrated by the governing Democrat Party with cooperation from security organizations, with Menderes and Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu mobilizing the DP's party machinery and party-controlled trade unions.[^45] The violence was triggered by the bombing of the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki, Greece—Atatürk's birthplace—though the bomb was actually planted by a Turkish consulate employee who later confessed.[^46] The Turkish press remained silent about this revelation and instead insinuated Greek responsibility. Turkish mobs, many trucked into Istanbul in advance, assaulted the Greek community for nine hours, resulting in over a dozen deaths from beatings and arson, with Armenian and Jewish communities also suffering harm.[^47] The pogrom resulted in the flight and emigration of Istanbul's Greek minority, which numbered approximately 100,000 and was subsequently reduced to a few thousand.[^48] Menderes was later charged with responsibility for the pogrom during the 1960-61 Yassiada trials.[^49]

Beyond this atrocity, the Menderes government systematically targeted opposition voices and institutions. The administration stifled the CHP-friendly press, forced disobedient civil servants, judges, and professors into early retirement, and violently crushed anti-government protests.[^50] The government granted the Finance Ministry authority to audit the opposition CHP's internal finances, using state power to harass political opponents.[^51] These authoritarian measures eroded the democratic freedoms that had characterized the DP's initial rise to power and alienated intellectuals, the military establishment, and urban elites who valued constitutional governance.

Economically, Menderes's policies ultimately brought Turkey to the brink of insolvency. While encouraging private enterprise, his government pursued heedless importation of foreign goods and technology without adequate planning for debt servicing.[^52] Inflation in Turkey rose dramatically from 3% in 1950 to 20% in 1957, as the DP borrowed from the central bank rather than increasing taxes on the landowners who had brought them to power.[^53] The Turkish lira plummeted from 2 to 9 per U.S. dollar, and Turkey defaulted on $600 million in debt.[^54] The devaluation of the lira in August 1958 caused a spike in inflation and forced the economy to contract sharply, creating widespread unemployment and factory closures.[^55]

The economic crisis compelled Menderes to seek an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan in 1958, signing Turkey's first stabilization agreement amid financial turmoil.[^56] While the economic controls implemented as part of the IMF program succeeded in reducing inflation, the damage to Menderes's reputation and the suffering caused by austerity measures intensified opposition.[^57] Despite winning the 1957 elections, opposition to Menderes was mounting among military officers, intellectuals, students, and urban populations who blamed him for economic mismanagement and democratic backsliding.[^58] These controversies—from the Istanbul pogrom to authoritarian governance to economic crisis—created the conditions for the military coup that would end his government and his life.

## Personal Life

Adnan Menderes married Fatma Berin Menderes (1905-1994) in 1928, a union that proved significant both personally and politically given his wife's family's strong political connections.[^59] The couple had three sons: Yüksel (1930-1972), Mutlu (1937-1978), and Aydın (1946-2011), all born in Ankara during Menderes's years as a parliamentarian and later as prime minister.[^60] His family provided stability amid the intense pressures of political life, though the demands of governing meant extended periods away from his wife and children.

Menderes's childhood experiences profoundly shaped his personality. Having lost his parents and sister at a young age, he suffered from loneliness throughout his youth, raised primarily by his grandmother after inheriting substantial estates at age nine.[^61] This early trauma and responsibility cultivated in him both independence and a certain emotional reserve, though publicly he projected warmth and charisma that connected with ordinary Turks. Friends and colleagues noted his strong work ethic and his genuine interest in the welfare of rural populations, reflecting his own background as a landowner who understood agricultural life.

Beyond politics, Menderes maintained interests in sports and modern farming. He was passionate about football, playing initially for Karşıyaka Club until an embarrassing incident when fans booed him after he missed a scoring opportunity, after which he switched to Altay, serving as goalkeeper.[^62] This anecdote reveals both his willingness to participate in popular culture and his sensitivity to public opinion—traits that would characterize his political career. As a landowner, Menderes demonstrated progressive attitudes, eventually selling or distributing most of his inherited estates to small shareholders while retaining one farm, which he developed into a model of modern agricultural methods, experimenting with mechanization and improved techniques.[^63]

Menderes's personality combined populist instincts with a certain aristocratic bearing derived from his landowning background. He was known for his eloquence as a speaker and his ability to connect emotionally with audiences, particularly rural voters who felt he understood their concerns. However, critics noted an authoritarian streak and sensitivity to criticism that intensified as his government faced mounting challenges. His final words before execution revealed his devotion to family and nation: "At this very moment when I am departing from life, tell my family and children that I remember them with compassion. May Allah bless our homeland and nation with eternal welfare."[^64] These words reflected the dual priorities that defined his life—care for his family and unwavering commitment to Turkey's prosperity.

## Legacy

Adnan Menderes's legacy remains one of the most contested and polarizing in modern Turkish history, with dramatically divergent assessments depending on political perspective. His execution on September 17, 1961, following the military coup, transformed him from a disgraced politician into a martyr for democracy in the eyes of his supporters.[^65] The 1960 coup paved the way for subsequent military interventions in Turkey's fragile democracy, but it also made Menderes an enduring figure whose image as a man of the people, whose life was cut short by military tutelage's power over politics, resonated across generations.[^66]

On September 17, 1990, on the 29th anniversary of his execution, Menderes was posthumously pardoned by the Turkish Parliament, an acknowledgment of the injustice he and his colleagues suffered at the hands of the military tribunal.[^67] This rehabilitation represented a partial vindication, recognizing that the Yassiada trials lacked fairness and transparency, with proceedings widely seen as politically motivated rather than judicially sound.[^68] The Law No. 3623, adopted by the Grand National Assembly on April 11, 1990, formally rehabilitated Menderes along with Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Finance Minister Hasan Polatkan, who were executed alongside him.[^69]

Menderes has remained extremely popular among rural and conservative segments of Turkish society, becoming a symbol of right-wing politics and democratic legitimacy against military authoritarianism.[^70] Since the currently governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has openly defended Menderes's legacy and promoted conservative values, his historical significance has increased in recent years.[^71] President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has frequently invoked Menderes's memory, drawing parallels between his own struggles against military and bureaucratic elites and those faced by Menderes in the 1950s. This political appropriation has intensified debates about Menderes's true legacy and its relevance to contemporary Turkish politics.

The physical commemoration of Menderes includes the Adnan Menderes Mausoleum, where he is buried, which has become a pilgrimage site for supporters who view him as a democratic hero unjustly killed by anti-democratic forces.[^72] Universities, airports, boulevards, and numerous public institutions bear his name, particularly in western Turkey and in areas where the DP enjoyed strong support. Aydın Adnan Menderes University, established in his hometown region, stands as a permanent memorial to his contributions.[^73]

Scholarly assessments emphasize that Menderes's advent to power marked a watershed in Turkish history, seriously challenging the monopoly of Atatürk's old guard on state and society.[^74] The DP's electoral victories were secured by votes of those who had been excluded or suppressed by Kemalist reforms, representing a democratic assertion of popular will against elite domination.[^75] His government's legacy includes Turkey's integration into Western security structures through NATO membership, economic modernization through infrastructure development, and the establishment of competitive multi-party democracy, however imperfect.

Yet this legacy is inseparable from the authoritarian turn his government took, the Istanbul pogrom, economic mismanagement, and the erosion of constitutional norms. The Menderes era demonstrated both the possibilities and perils of democratic transition in developing nations, showing how elected leaders can simultaneously deliver prosperity and commit serious abuses. He is remembered for his vision of a more prosperous and democratic Turkey that balanced modernization with respect for traditional values, though his tragic fate serves as a reminder of the dangers of political polarization and the fragility of democratic institutions.[^76] The contested nature of his legacy reflects deeper divisions in Turkish society between secular and religious, urban and rural, and establishment and populist forces that persist to this day.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic historians view Adnan Menderes as a democratic pioneer who broke the monopoly of single-party rule and gave voice to Turkey's marginalized majority. His 1950 electoral victory represented the first genuine transfer of power through free elections in Turkish history, marking the transition from authoritarian single-party rule to competitive democracy.[^77] Scholars emphasize that the DP prevailed by mobilizing peasants who constituted approximately 80% of the population, representing a democratic mandate from those who had been excluded by Kemalist elites.[^78]

Economically, defenders point to the remarkable 9% annual GDP growth rate during Menderes's tenure as evidence of effective governance and successful modernization.[^79] The construction of 40,000 kilometers of highways and 30,000 kilometers of village roads transformed Turkey's infrastructure and connectivity, while mechanization of agriculture and expansion of electricity networks improved living standards for millions.[^80] Agricultural production increased by over 50% between 1950 and 1954, demonstrating the tangible benefits of his policies for rural populations.[^81] Supporters argue that his economic liberalization laid the groundwork for Turkey's later industrial development and market economy.

In foreign policy, Menderes's decision to commit Turkish troops to the Korean War and secure NATO membership in 1952 is praised as strategic statesmanship that guaranteed Turkey's security during the Cold War and established the country as a valued Western ally.[^82] His willingness to pursue constructive relations with Greece, culminating in the 1959 Zurich Agreement on Cyprus, demonstrated diplomatic skill in managing complex regional conflicts.[^83]

Culturally, Menderes is celebrated for recognizing the religious sensibilities of Turkey's Muslim majority population by legalizing the Arabic call to prayer and relaxing restrictions on religious expression, correcting what many viewed as excessive secularism that alienated ordinary Turks from their own traditions.[^84] His supporters argue he sought to balance modernization with respect for traditional values, creating space for religious identity within the republican framework.

Most importantly, Menderes's defenders argue that his execution by military tribunal represented a grave injustice and a reversal of democratic progress. The Yassiada trials are condemned as show trials lacking procedural fairness, with verdicts predetermined by military officers determined to restore their preferred political order.[^85] The posthumous parliamentary pardon in 1990 is cited as vindication of this view.[^86] Menderes is remembered as a martyr for democracy whose vision of popular sovereignty threatened entrenched elites, making him a symbol of resistance against military tutelage over civilian politics that would plague Turkey for decades.[^87]

### Negative Views

Critics and opposing historians present a starkly different assessment, emphasizing Menderes's authoritarian practices, economic mismanagement, and responsibility for ethnic violence. Detractors argue that the DP government could only last a decade before military intervention due to allegations of authoritarianism that were well-founded.[^88] The party's increasingly autocratic turn—stifling the press, forcing civil servants and judges into early retirement, violently suppressing protests, and using state apparatus to harass opposition—demonstrated that Menderes had created an elective dictatorship that betrayed democratic principles.[^89]

The most damning criticism concerns Menderes's orchestration of the September 1955 Istanbul pogrom against Greek minorities, which critics describe as state-sponsored ethnic cleansing.[^90] The violence, organized by the DP government with security organization cooperation, resulted in deaths, widespread destruction of property, and the exodus of nearly 100,000 Greek residents who had lived in Istanbul for generations.[^91] Scholars note that the bomb in Thessaloniki that supposedly triggered the violence was planted by a Turkish consulate employee, revealing the pogrom as a premeditated act rather than spontaneous response.[^92] This atrocity, they argue, demonstrates the fundamentally illiberal and dangerous character of Menderes's government.

Economically, critics emphasize that Menderes's policies brought Turkey to insolvency through reckless borrowing and importation without sustainable planning.[^93] Inflation skyrocketed from 3% to 20%, the lira collapsed from 2 to 9 per dollar, and Turkey defaulted on $600 million in debt, necessitating humiliating IMF intervention in 1958.[^94] The economic crisis caused factory closures, unemployment, and hardship that contradicted the early prosperity, suggesting Menderes prioritized short-term popularity over sound economic management.

Kemalist critics argue that Menderes exploited religious sentiment and rural conservatism to undermine the secular, modernizing reforms that had made Turkey a progressive nation-state, pandering to backward-looking elements rather than advancing enlightenment values.[^95] His relaxation of religious restrictions is portrayed not as tolerance but as cynical populism that empowered reactionary forces opposed to Turkey's Western orientation.

The military officers who conducted the 1960 coup and subsequent trial justified their actions as necessary to save Turkish democracy from Menderes's dictatorship and to restore constitutional order.[^96] While international opinion condemned the execution, including appeals from President John F. Kennedy and Queen Elizabeth II, the military proceeded with the death sentence, viewing it as essential to prevent future authoritarian backsliding.[^97] Critics note that Menderes, despite his denials at trial, had clearly violated constitutional norms and democratic principles, making intervention justifiable even if the execution was excessive.

Scholarly critics emphasize that the Menderes era exacerbated societal polarization rather than fostering reconciliation, creating divisions between secular and religious, urban and rural, that continue to destabilize Turkish politics.[^98] The Yassiada trials, while procedurally flawed, addressed genuine crimes and constitutional violations, and Menderes's posthumous rehabilitation reflects political calculation by later governments rather than historical justice.[^99] From this perspective, Menderes's legacy is one of squandered democratic opportunity, ethnic violence, economic irresponsibility, and authoritarian governance that set dangerous precedents for Turkish politics.
