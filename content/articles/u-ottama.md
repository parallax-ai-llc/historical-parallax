## Summary

Sayadaw U Ottama (1879-1939) was a pioneering Theravada Buddhist monk who became the father of Myanmar's independence movement against British colonial rule. Born in Rakhine State, he studied extensively in India, Japan, and across Asia before returning to Burma to become the first monk imprisoned for political speech in 1921. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent resistance philosophy, U Ottama led boycotts of British goods, promoted indigenous Burmese cloth (pinni), and delivered powerful anti-colonial speeches that mobilized Burmese society against imperial rule. His courageous activism, which resulted in repeated imprisonments between 1921 and 1939, established the precedent for monk-led political movements in Burma and directly inspired future independence leaders including Aung San and U Nu.

## Early Life and Background

U Ottama was born Paw Tun Aung on December 28, 1879, in the village of Rupa, Sittwe District, in western Burma's Rakhine (Arakan) region.[^1] He was the son of U Mra and Daw Aung Kwa Pyu, and assumed the religious name Ottama when he entered the Buddhist monkhood.[^2] The ethnic Rakhine monk grew up during a period of British colonial consolidation following the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886, witnessing firsthand the social and economic disruptions caused by foreign rule.[^3]

U Ottama's early education followed the traditional monastic path, but his intellectual curiosity and commitment to understanding colonialism drove him to pursue studies beyond Burma's borders.[^4] This desire to comprehend the broader forces shaping Asia would take him on an extraordinary educational journey spanning multiple continents and cultures, rare for Burmese monks of his generation.[^5]

His Rakhine heritage significantly influenced his worldview. The Arakan region had its own distinct history of independence before British conquest, and this legacy of resistance likely shaped young Paw Tun Aung's developing consciousness about colonialism and national sovereignty.[^6] The region's proximity to India also meant greater exposure to Indian nationalist thought, which would profoundly impact his later political philosophy.[^7]

Little is documented about his childhood and the specific circumstances that led him to the monkhood, but his later writings and speeches demonstrated deep Buddhist learning combined with sophisticated political analysis—suggesting a rigorous early education in both religious texts and contemporary affairs.[^8] The combination of traditional Buddhist scholarship and modern political consciousness would become U Ottama's defining characteristic, enabling him to frame anti-colonial resistance in religious terms that resonated deeply with the Burmese Buddhist population.[^9]

## Education and International Travels

U Ottama's education took him far beyond the traditional boundaries of monastic training in Burma. He studied in Calcutta for three years, where he was introduced to the ideas and methods of the Indian National Congress and exposed firsthand to the burgeoning Indian independence movement.[^10] This experience in Calcutta proved transformative, as he witnessed how Indian nationalists were mobilizing mass movements against British rule through nonviolent resistance and boycotts.[^11]

Following his studies in Calcutta, U Ottama embarked on extensive travels throughout India, France, and Egypt, absorbing diverse political philosophies and anti-colonial strategies.[^12] In January 1907, he traveled to Japan, where he taught Pali and Sanskrit at the Academy of Buddhist Science in Tokyo.[^13] His time in Japan coincided with the aftermath of Japan's stunning victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, which had electrified anti-colonial movements across Asia by demonstrating that an Asian nation could defeat a European power.[^14]

U Ottama was profoundly influenced by this Japanese victory, repeatedly citing how "small" Asians had defeated "the bigger and stronger" Europeans as evidence that colonial rule was not invincible.[^15] He repeatedly visited Japan and even facilitated Burmese students studying there, promoting Pan-Asian solidarity and the exchange of anti-colonial ideas.[^16] After his time in Japan, he continued his travels through Korea, Manchuria, Port Arthur, China, Annam (Vietnam), Cambodia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka before returning to India.[^17]

These extensive travels distinguished U Ottama as one of the first Burmese monks to study abroad and exposed him to diverse forms of resistance against Western imperialism.[^18] His education combined traditional Buddhist scholarship in Pali and Sanskrit with modern political thought, international law, and comparative studies of anti-colonial movements.[^19] This unique synthesis of religious authority and political sophistication would enable him to mobilize Burmese society in ways that purely secular nationalists could not, as he could frame independence as both a political necessity and a Buddhist religious duty.[^20]

---

## Rise to Political Prominence

Upon his return to British Burma, U Ottama immediately began his political activities, touring the country and lecturing for the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA), a lay Buddhist organization founded in 1906 that was becoming increasingly nationalist.[^21] The YMBA had been created to preserve Buddhist-based culture in Burma against the backdrop of British colonialism, and U Ottama's fiery speeches gave it a more militant, anti-colonial direction.[^22]

U Ottama's oratory skills and charisma attracted large followings of Buddhist monks and laypeople alike.[^23] He transformed what had been primarily a cultural preservation movement into an explicitly political independence campaign, applying lessons learned from Gandhi's Indian National Congress.[^24] In a Gandhian manner, he reframed the essentially political issue of nationalism and independence as a religious imperative, which appealed powerfully even to those who had not received Western education.[^25]

His political activities centered on three main strategies: delivering anti-colonial speeches that denounced British rule, organizing peaceful demonstrations and strikes, and promoting boycotts of British goods in favor of indigenous Burmese products.[^26] U Ottama massively popularized the wearing of local pinni—handmade, coarse cotton fabric, naturally reddish or reddish-yellow in color—similar to Gandhi's khadi (homespun) campaign in India.[^27] This made resistance tangible and visible in everyday life, as wearing pinni became a nationalist statement.[^28]

U Ottama's influence extended through his patriotic writings in "The Sun," where he articulated his vision for Burmese independence and Buddhist socialism.[^29] His speeches were considered radical for their time, directly challenging British authority in ways few Burmese had dared.[^30] With his extensive knowledge of international affairs gained through his travels, he helped raise the political awareness of the Burmese people, and his words had the power to motivate people and dispel fears in the face of imperialism.[^31]

Following the YMBA's key involvement in the 1920 student strike, the most nationalist elements broke off and formed the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA), which became the primary vehicle for organized anti-colonial activities.[^32] U Ottama's activities within these organizations created a militant, anti-colonial movement that propagated a combination of nationalism, Buddhism, and, in its later stages, socialism.[^33]

---

## Major Achievements and Political Impact

U Ottama's most significant achievement was pioneering the role of Buddhist monks as political activists in Burma's independence movement. He was one of the first monks to enter the political arena and the first person in British Burma to be imprisoned as a result of making a political speech, establishing a precedent followed by a long line of nationalists including Aung San and U Nu.[^34] This transformation of the monkhood's role from purely religious to politically engaged would define Burmese resistance movements for decades to come.[^35]

His advocacy of nonviolent resistance, inspired by Gandhian principles, introduced disciplined mass protest strategies to Burma.[^36] U Ottama promoted peaceful protests, boycotts of British goods, and a revival of indigenous values and self-reliance, creating a comprehensive resistance framework that addressed both political and economic dimensions of colonialism.[^37] He framed his opposition to colonial rule through Buddhist ethics, creating a compelling moral argument that strongly resonated with the Burmese people.[^38]

U Ottama successfully mobilized large numbers of Buddhist monks (pongyi) to participate in the political movement, creating an organized force that the British found particularly difficult to suppress given the monkhood's revered status in Burmese society.[^39] His monastery in Sittwe, the Shwe Zedi Kyaung, founded in 1903, became a focal point of Burmese and Arakanese politics and is considered the birthplace of political Buddhism in Myanmar.[^40] The monastery continues to serve as an important center for political activism, with monks from Shwe Zedi initiating protests and demonstrations into the 21st century.[^41]

He held leadership positions in nationalist organizations, including serving as leader of the All India Hindu Mahasabhas in 1935, demonstrating the regional scope of his anti-colonial activities and Pan-Asian solidarity.[^42] His writings and speeches systematically dismantled the ideological justifications for British rule, arguing that Burmese people had the right to self-determination and that foreign domination violated Buddhist principles of justice and compassion.[^43]

U Ottama's economic resistance strategies, particularly the pinni cloth movement, created practical alternatives to dependence on British imports and fostered indigenous economic development.[^44] This swadeshi approach helped develop Burmese self-reliance while simultaneously undermining the economic foundations of colonial rule.[^45] His patriotic fervor and courage inspired younger generations of Burmese who would eventually win independence in 1948, nine years after his death.[^46]

---

## Imprisonments and Resistance

U Ottama's political activism resulted in repeated arrests and imprisonments that consumed much of the final two decades of his life. In 1921, he was arrested for his infamous "Craddock, Get Out!" speech against the Craddock Scheme proposed by Sir Reginald Craddock, then Governor of British Burma.[^47] This direct confrontation was shocking for Burmese society at the time, but it also enlightened the Burmese people that they had the right to oppose British authority.[^48]

He was tried for sedition and sentenced to eighteen months in prison, becoming the first person in British Burma to be imprisoned as a result of making a political speech.[^49] This marked a watershed moment in Burmese political history, demonstrating that direct resistance to colonial authority, while carrying consequences, was possible.[^50] According to academic sources, between 1921 and 1927, U Ottama spent more time in prison than outside, reflecting the British colonial government's determination to silence him.[^51]

Despite repeated imprisonments on charges of sedition, U Ottama carried on with his activism during periods of freedom, never wavering in his commitment to independence.[^52] Each imprisonment only enhanced his status as a martyr and hero among the Burmese population, strengthening rather than diminishing the independence movement.[^53] The British colonial authorities viewed U Ottama's activities as seditious and threatening to colonial order, but their harsh response backfired by generating public sympathy and outrage.[^54]

In the 1930s, U Ottama was imprisoned again, and to protest his detention, he went on hunger strikes following the Gandhian tradition of nonviolent resistance.[^55] The British authorities largely ignored these hunger strikes, refusing to negotiate with him or address his demands for Burma's independence.[^56] While imprisoned, U Ottama suffered from diabetes, a condition that worsened due to the poor prison conditions and his hunger strikes.[^57]

On September 9, 1939, after years of imprisonment, U Ottama died at Rangoon General Hospital at the age of 60, suffering from diabetes complications.[^58] The British government's refusal to provide adequate medical care or release him despite his deteriorating health was widely seen as allowing him to die in custody, further inflaming anti-British sentiment.[^59] His death in British custody transformed him into a powerful symbol of resistance and sacrifice, cementing his status as a national martyr.[^60]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

From the British colonial perspective, U Ottama was a dangerous agitator whose speeches constituted sedition and threatened public order.[^61] Colonial administrators viewed his mobilization of Buddhist monks as a cynical manipulation of religion for political purposes and worried that his influence was radicalizing the traditionally apolitical monkhood.[^62] They repeatedly charged him with sedition, arguing that his inflammatory rhetoric could incite violence, even though U Ottama himself advocated nonviolent resistance.[^63]

Some critics within the Burmese Buddhist establishment also questioned whether monks should engage in political activism, arguing that it violated the monastic discipline and distracted from spiritual pursuits.[^64] Traditional interpretations of Buddhist monastic rules emphasized detachment from worldly affairs, and U Ottama's political involvement represented a controversial departure from these norms.[^65] Some conservative monks argued that his activities brought politics into the sangha (monastic community), creating divisions and compromising the monastery's spiritual mission.[^66]

His extended absences from Burma during his years of travel and study also drew some criticism from those who questioned his commitment to the local struggle and suggested he was more interested in international Pan-Asian movements than practical work in Burma.[^67] Additionally, his close association with Indian nationalist movements led some Burmese nationalists to worry about Indian influence on Burma's independence movement, particularly given existing ethnic and economic tensions between Burmese and Indian communities in colonial Burma.[^68]

U Ottama's uncompromising stance and fiery rhetoric sometimes created difficulties for more moderate nationalist leaders who were attempting to negotiate constitutional reforms with the British.[^69] His radical approach made it harder for moderates to position themselves as reasonable alternative voices, potentially prolonging the conflict.[^70] The British used his activism to justify harsh crackdowns on all nationalist activities, arguing that any concessions would embolden extremists.[^71]

His health issues in his final years, partly resulting from hunger strikes and poor prison conditions, also raised questions about the wisdom of self-destructive protest methods, though supporters viewed his suffering as noble sacrifice.[^72] Some historians have noted that his death in 1939, before Burma achieved independence in 1948, meant he could not participate in shaping the post-independence nation, and thus his practical political legacy was less developed than his symbolic importance.[^73]

## Personal Life and Character

As a Theravada Buddhist monk who entered the monkhood at a young age, U Ottama took vows of celibacy and renounced family life.[^74] There are no records of him having a wife or children, as his commitment to the monastic path precluded marriage.[^75] Beyond his parents, U Mra and Daw Aung Kwa Pyu, historical sources contain minimal information about his extended family or personal relationships, as his life was devoted entirely to religious service and political activism.[^76]

Those who knew U Ottama described him as a fiery speaker and charismatic agitator capable of attracting large followings.[^77] His oratory skills were legendary, with the ability to move audiences emotionally while also presenting sophisticated political arguments drawn from his extensive international education.[^78] He combined deep Buddhist learning with cosmopolitan knowledge of world affairs, making him uniquely capable of speaking to both traditional rural audiences and Western-educated urban elites.[^79]

U Ottama's personality reflected courage and unwavering commitment to his principles. Despite knowing that his speeches would result in imprisonment, he never moderated his message or sought compromise with British authorities.[^80] His willingness to endure repeated incarcerations and ultimately die in prison demonstrated extraordinary moral conviction and personal sacrifice.[^81] An admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, U Ottama did not advocate the use of violence, maintaining strict adherence to nonviolent resistance principles even when facing severe repression.[^82]

His extensive travels before returning to Burma revealed an adventurous spirit and intellectual curiosity unusual for monks of his era.[^83] The fact that he learned multiple languages, including fluency in Pali, Sanskrit, and likely several modern Asian languages, demonstrated his scholarly dedication.[^84] His writings in "The Sun" showed sophisticated understanding of political theory, international relations, and economic systems.[^85]

Colleagues and followers remembered U Ottama as inspiring and fearless, someone whose moral authority derived both from his religious status and his personal integrity.[^86] His life of poverty, adherence to monastic discipline, and willingness to suffer for his beliefs gave him credibility that secular politicians lacked.[^87] Even British colonial officials, while viewing him as a dangerous opponent, generally acknowledged his sincerity and the genuine following he commanded.[^88]

## Legacy and Historical Impact

U Ottama is considered by many historians to be the father of Myanmar's independence movement, the pioneer who first demonstrated that organized, sustained resistance to British rule was possible.[^89] He is recognized as one of the national heroes of modern Myanmar, with his contributions to independence acknowledged across political and ethnic divides.[^90] His transformation of the Buddhist monkhood from a politically passive institution to an active participant in nationalist struggles fundamentally altered Burmese politics and established patterns that continue to the present day.[^91]

The precedent he established of monks engaging in political activism created a long tradition in Myanmar, from the independence movement through the 1988 democracy uprising and the 2007 Saffron Revolution.[^92] His monastery in Sittwe, the Shwe Zedi Kyaung, continues to serve as a focal point for political activities, with monks from this monastery leading protests and demonstrations well into the 21st century.[^93] The 2007 monks' movement began with a march from the Shwe Zedi monastery to the prison in Sittwe demanding the release of an imprisoned activist, directly echoing U Ottama's legacy.[^94]

U Ottama's influence on future independence leaders was profound. He paved the way for Aung San, U Nu, and other nationalists who would complete the struggle he began.[^95] The General Council of Buddhist Associations (GCBA), which U Ottama helped energize, provided the organizational foundation for the independence movement and served as a training ground for future leaders.[^96] Aung San himself compiled investigations into colonial abuses and advocated nonviolent resistance while working within organizations U Ottama had pioneered.[^97]

His framework of combining Buddhist ethics with political resistance created a powerful ideological synthesis that gave the independence movement moral legitimacy and mass appeal.[^98] By framing colonialism as incompatible with Buddhist values, he mobilized populations who might not have responded to purely secular nationalist arguments.[^99] This religious dimension of Burmese nationalism, which U Ottama pioneered, remains influential in Myanmar's political culture.[^100]

Annually, his death on September 9, 1939, is commemorated by various groups in Myanmar and abroad in events referred to as "U Ottama Day."[^101] In 2024, the 85th anniversary of his death was observed by Arakanese communities in Thailand, Malaysia, and South Korea, demonstrating the continued reverence for his memory among the Rakhine diaspora.[^102] In Sittwe, U Ottama Park features a statue honoring him, where government officials, political parties, and civil society organizations gather annually to pay tribute.[^103]

His legacy extends beyond Myanmar to broader Pan-Asian anti-colonial movements, as his travels and connections helped facilitate exchanges of ideas and strategies among Asian independence movements.[^104] He demonstrated that small Asian nations could resist European imperialism by learning from each other and adapting successful strategies like Gandhi's nonviolent resistance to local contexts.[^105]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic scholars and historians widely regard U Ottama as a pioneering figure who fundamentally transformed Burmese nationalism from an elite, educated movement into a mass mobilization encompassing all levels of society.[^106] Anindita Choudhury's scholarly analysis published in the International Journal of Science and Research identifies U Ottama as "one of the most successful leaders of the nationalist movement" who "brought about new change in the nationalist movement in Burma" through nonviolence and boycott methods.[^107]

Historians emphasize his crucial role in politicizing the Buddhist monkhood, creating an indigenous form of resistance that drew on Burma's own cultural and religious traditions rather than simply imitating Western political models.[^108] This cultural authenticity made the independence movement more resonant with ordinary Burmese people.[^109] Scholars also credit U Ottama with introducing Gandhian nonviolent resistance strategies to Burma, providing a disciplined, morally compelling alternative to violent uprising.[^110]

Research by Maynadi Kyaw at Kyoto University highlights U Ottama's role in Pan-Asianism, showing how his international connections and travels facilitated the exchange of anti-colonial ideas across Asia.[^111] His ability to synthesize influences from Indian, Japanese, and other Asian independence movements while adapting them to Burmese circumstances demonstrated sophisticated political thinking.[^112] Human Rights Watch's analysis of Buddhist activism in Burma identifies U Ottama as establishing the foundational tradition of monk-led resistance that continues to shape Myanmar's political landscape.[^113]

Contemporary Burmese and international observers often compare U Ottama to Mahatma Gandhi, calling him the "Gandhi of Burma" for his commitment to nonviolent resistance and moral politics.[^114] His willingness to suffer imprisonment and ultimately die for his principles is seen as exemplifying the highest ideals of both Buddhist compassion and political courage.[^115] The continued commemorations of U Ottama Day and the reverence shown at his memorials demonstrate his enduring status as a national hero.[^116]

### Critical Perspectives

Some historians argue that U Ottama's radical approach and uncompromising stance may have hardened British resistance to constitutional reforms, making it more difficult for moderate nationalists to achieve incremental progress.[^117] His inflammatory speeches gave colonial authorities justification for harsh crackdowns that affected the entire nationalist movement, not just his followers.[^118] Critics suggest that a more gradualist approach might have achieved independence with less conflict and suffering.[^119]

Scholarly analysis has also questioned whether U Ottama's politicization of the monkhood ultimately served Burma's long-term interests, arguing that it compromised the sangha's spiritual mission and created lasting divisions within the Buddhist community.[^120] The involvement of monks in politics has remained controversial in Myanmar, with periodic attempts to enforce stricter separation between religious and political spheres.[^121]

Some historians note that U Ottama's death in 1939 meant he could not participate in the crucial negotiations and transitions leading to independence in 1948, limiting his practical political legacy compared to his symbolic importance.[^122] Unlike Gandhi, who lived to see Indian independence (though he too was troubled by partition), U Ottama's vision for post-colonial Burma remained largely theoretical.[^123]

Certain nationalist historians have criticized U Ottama's close association with Indian movements and his time spent outside Burma, suggesting he was insufficiently focused on Burma's specific circumstances and too influenced by Indian models that might not translate well.[^124] Given the ethnic and economic tensions between Burmese and Indian communities in colonial Burma, this association sometimes complicated his message.[^125]

Western historians writing from colonial-era perspectives portrayed U Ottama as a dangerous agitator and religious fanatic who cynically manipulated Buddhism for political purposes.[^126] While these views are now largely discredited as reflecting colonial bias, they shaped British policy toward Burma and influenced international perceptions of the independence movement.[^127] Some contemporary scholars argue that U Ottama's religious framing of nationalism contributed to the difficulties Myanmar has faced in developing secular, pluralistic political institutions.[^128]
