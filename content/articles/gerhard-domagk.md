## Summary

Gerhard Domagk was a German pathologist and bacteriologist who discovered sulfonamide, the first commercially available antibiotic. His discovery of Prontosil in 1932, the first drug to successfully treat bacterial infections in humans, saved millions of lives and launched the age of antibacterial chemotherapy. He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine but was forced by the Nazi regime to decline it.
