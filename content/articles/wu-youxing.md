## Summary

Wu Youxing was a Ming Dynasty physician who proposed that epidemic diseases are caused by invisible pathogenic particles transmitted through the air, anticipating germ theory by over 200 years. His 1642 treatise Wen Yi Lun (Treatise on Pestilence) was one of the earliest works to suggest that different diseases have different specific causes.
