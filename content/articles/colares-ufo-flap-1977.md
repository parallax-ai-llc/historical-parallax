## Summary

The Colares incident is the only known case where a government military force was deployed to fight/investigate a **hostile** UFO presence. In 1977, residents of the Brazilian island of Colares reported being attacked by beams of light from the sky that sucked their blood and left burn marks.

The terrified population called it **"Chupa-Chupa"** (The Sucker). The Brazilian Air Force launched **Operation Saucer** (Operação Prato), led by Captain **Uyrangê Hollanda**. Over months, they documented hundreds of sightings, took photos, and filmed the objects. Years later, Captain Hollanda revealed the truth before committing suicide under mysterious circumstances.[^1]

## The Attacks

### "Chupa-Chupa"
Villagers reported luminous shapes (cylinders, spheres) descending at night.
*   **The Beam:** A thin light beam would hit the victim (often women), leaving puncture marks and causing weakness/anemia.
*   **Panic:** The town was evacuated. Women and children left; men stood guard with fireworks and guns.

## Operation Saucer

### Military Deployment
The Air Force set up camp, armed with cameras and theodolites.
*   **Encounters:** Captain Hollanda reported seeing huge motherships (100m wide) and smaller probes.
*   **The Blue Being:** In a posthumous interview, Hollanda claimed they saw a humanoid being floating.
*   **Closure:** The operation was abruptly shut down after 4 months, and all files were classified.[^2]

### Declassified Files
In the 2000s, Brazil released thousands of pages of documents and sketches from the operation, confirming the military had tracked these objects extensively.
