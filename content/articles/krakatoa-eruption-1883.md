## Overview

The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (Krakatau) was the first global media event of the telegraph age. The island volcano, located between Java and Sumatra, exploded with a force of 200 megatons (4x the Tsar Bomba). The blast generated a noise so loud it ruptured eardrums of sailors 40 miles away and was heard clearly in **Alice Springs, Australia** (2,200 miles) and **Rodriguez Island** (3,000 miles). The resulting tsunamis killed nearly 36,000 people, and the atmospheric ash turned sunsets blood-red around the world for years (famously inspiring the background of Munch's *The Scream*).

## The Climactic Phase (August 27, 1883)

After months of grumbling, the mountain ripped itself apart.
**The Four Explosions:**
1.  **5:30 AM (Perboewatan):** Triggered a tsunami at Telok Betong.
2.  **6:44 AM (Danan):** Another vent opened.
3.  **10:02 AM (The Big One):** The magma chamber collapsed, letting seawater rush into the molten rock. The resulting phreatomagmatic explosion vaporized 2/3 of the island.
    *   **The Sound:** Heard across 1/13th of the globe.
    *   **The Shockwave:** Barometers recorded the air pressure wave circling the Earth **7 times**.

**The Tsunami:**
Waves up to **135 feet (41m)** high slammed into Java and Sumatra.
It wiped out 165 coastal villages.
The Dutch steamship *Berouw* was carried a mile inland and deposited in a jungle valley. All 28 crew died.

## Global Effects

**The Sky Bleeds:**
The dust veil filtered sunlight.
For three years, the world saw "Bishop's Rings" around the sun and incredibly vivid, blood-red afterglows.
**Climate:**
Global temperatures dropped by 1.2°C (2.2°F). Weather patterns were chaotic until 1888.

**Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatoa):**
In 1927, a new island emerged from the underwater caldera. It is still active and growing today (and caused another deadly tsunami in 2018).
