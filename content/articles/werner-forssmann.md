## Summary

Werner Forssmann performed the first cardiac catheterization on himself in 1929, inserting a catheter through his arm vein into his own heart to prove the procedure was possible. Initially dismissed and even fired for his daring experiment, he was vindicated by receiving the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. His self-experimentation opened the field of interventional cardiology.
