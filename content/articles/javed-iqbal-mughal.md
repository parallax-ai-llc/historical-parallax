## Summary
Javed Iqbal murdered 100 boys in Lahore, Pakistan between 1998 and 1999, dissolving their bodies in acid. He confessed by letter to a newspaper. Sentenced to a symbolic death mirroring his crimes, he was found dead in his cell in 2001 before execution.

## Early Life

## Capture / Downfall
He sent a confession letter and evidence to a newspaper in December 1999, then surrendered to a journalist rather than police. In March 2000, he was sentenced to death by strangulation and dismemberment. Found dead in his cell October 7, 2001, in apparent suicide. [^3]
