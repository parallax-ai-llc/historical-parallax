## Summary

Javier Gerardo Milei is an Argentine economist, author, and politician who has served as the 59th President of Argentina since December 10, 2023.[^1] Born on October 22, 1970, Milei rose to prominence as a libertarian economist and television pundit before entering politics in 2021.[^2] His radical free-market agenda, characterized by sweeping austerity measures and his signature catchphrase "¡Viva la libertad, carajo!" ("Long live freedom, damn it!"), propelled him to a historic electoral victory in 2023.[^3] Milei's presidency represents one of the most dramatic ideological shifts in Argentine political history, implementing what he calls "chainsaw economics" to combat the country's chronic inflation and economic instability.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Javier Gerardo Milei was born on October 22, 1970, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Norberto Horacio Milei, a bus driver of Italian descent who later became a successful entrepreneur, and Alicia Lujan Lucich, a homemaker.[^5] He grew up in the upper-middle-class Villa Devoto neighborhood of Buenos Aires alongside his younger sister Karina, who would later become one of his most trusted political advisers.[^6] During a television interview, Milei admitted to having a troubled childhood marked by repeated problems with his parents, an experience that profoundly shaped his personality and worldview.[^7]

Milei attended Catholic schools during his youth, where classmates nicknamed him "el Loco" ("the Madman") because of his passionate speeches and fiery arguments on various topics.[^8] This intensity would become a defining characteristic throughout his career. As a teenager, Milei pursued two very different passions: football and rock music. He served as goalkeeper for the Chacarita Juniors football team until 1989, playing in the youth divisions and earning the nickname "El Loco Milei" for his aggressive playing style.[^9] Simultaneously, he was the lead vocalist for a Rolling Stones cover band called Everest, performing with the group in his late teens and early twenties.[^10]

In 1989, Milei made the pivotal decision to abandon his dreams of becoming a professional goalkeeper and focus on economics, a choice prompted by Argentina's devastating hyperinflation crisis.[^11] He enrolled at the University of Belgrano, where he obtained a degree in economics, before pursuing advanced studies. Milei later earned two master's degrees—one from the Institute of Social and Economic Development and another from the prestigious private Torcuato di Tella University.[^12] His academic journey took him from Keynesianism through the neoclassical school before he ultimately embraced the Austrian School of economics after being exposed to the works of Murray Rothbard, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises during his post-graduate studies.[^13]

## Rise to Power

After completing his education, Milei embarked on a career as an economist in Argentina's private sector. He worked for HSBC Argentina before becoming the head economist at the private pension fund Máxima AFJP, then at financial advising firm Estudio Broda.[^14] His longest and most significant private sector role was at Corporación América, a multinational holding company owned by one of Argentina's richest men, billionaire Eduardo Eurnekian, where Milei worked as chief economist for 15 years from 2008 to 2021.[^15] During this period, he also served as a professor of macroeconomics, economics of growth, microeconomics, and mathematics for economists for more than twenty-one years.[^16]

Milei's public profile expanded dramatically during the 2010s when he became a fixture on Argentine television as an economic commentator and pundit. His theatrical presentation style, wild hair, and uncompromising libertarian views made him a controversial but compelling media personality.[^17] A 2018 ranking showed him as the most interviewed economist on Argentine television, appearing in 235 interviews totaling 193,347 seconds of airtime.[^18] He used these platforms to deliver scathing critiques of Argentina's political establishment, Keynesian economics, and government intervention in the economy, building a devoted following among Argentines frustrated with chronic inflation and economic stagnation.

In the 2021 legislative elections, Milei made his political debut, successfully winning election to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies representing the City of Buenos Aires for his newly formed party, La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances).[^19] His congressional campaign featured radical proposals including abolishing the Central Bank of Argentina and dollarizing the economy, positions that mainstream economists dismissed but which resonated with voters exhausted by economic crisis.[^20] In April 2022, Milei announced his candidacy for president in an interview with Clarín, beginning a campaign managed by his sister Karina that would transform Argentine politics.[^21]

During the August 2023 PASO primary elections, Milei shocked political observers by emerging as the leading candidate with 29.86% of the vote, defying pollsters' expectations.[^22] Though he placed second in the first round on October 22, 2023, behind Economy Minister Sergio Massa (who received almost 37% compared to Milei's 30%), he surged in the runoff election held on November 19, 2023.[^23] In a historic reversal, Milei defeated Massa by 11 percentage points, winning 55.69% of votes against 44.31%—the highest number of votes in Argentina's history, beating the previous record set by Mauricio Macri in 2015.[^24] In his victory speech, Milei vowed to begin "the reconstruction of Argentina" and end the country's economic decline.[^25]

## Major Achievements

Since taking office on December 10, 2023, Milei has implemented one of the most radical economic transformation programs in modern Latin American history, achieving results that have surprised both critics and supporters.[^26]

**Inflation Reduction**: Milei's most significant achievement has been the dramatic reduction in Argentina's runaway inflation. When he assumed the presidency, monthly inflation stood at an astounding 25.5%, with annual inflation exceeding 211%.[^27] Through aggressive monetary policy—including freezing the money supply and prohibiting the Central Bank of Argentina from printing new pesos—Milei cut monthly inflation in half within one fiscal quarter, bringing it down to 11.0% by March 2024.[^28] By November 2024, monthly inflation had plummeted to just 2.4%, and by January 2025 it reached a five-year low of 2.2%.[^29] In May 2025, the consumer price index rose by just 1.5 percent, the lowest rate in five years.[^30] Annual inflation, which peaked at 289% in April 2024, fell to 55.9% by March 2025—the lowest level in over three years.[^31]

**Fiscal Consolidation**: For the first time in 14 years, Argentina reported a budget surplus at the end of 2024.[^32] Milei transformed the country's fiscal position from a primary deficit of approximately three points of GDP in 2023 to a surplus projected at around 2% for 2024—a swing of almost five percentage points of GDP.[^33] This achievement required brutal spending cuts: Milei reduced government positions by approximately 52,000 (between 9.6% and 15.7% of the workforce), slashed salaries of high-ranking officials, and shut down the tax agency AFIP, replacing it with a smaller organization that saved billions.[^34] Within his first months in office, he closed half of Argentina's 18 ministries, including the Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity, citing the need to save money.[^35]

**Currency Stabilization**: The Argentine peso strengthened by 44.2% against the U.S. dollar during Milei's first year, boosting average wages in dollar terms to $990 and helping stabilize the exchange rate.[^36] This occurred despite Milei devaluing the peso by over 50% shortly after taking office and eliminating price controls.[^37]

**Economic Growth**: After contracting in early 2024 due to austerity measures, Argentina's economy grew 3.9% in the third quarter of 2024, helped by an 80.2% rebound in agriculture.[^38] Forecasts predict economic growth of 3.5%–5.5% in 2025 as inflation stabilizes and investments increase.[^39] There are now 330,000 more people employed than when Milei took office, with private sector employment increasing by 667,000 workers while public-sector employment fell by 367,000—marking the first time in years that Argentina created net jobs in the productive sector.[^40]

**Wage Growth**: In 2024, wages rose by 145.5%, outpacing the 117.8% inflation rate for the first time since 2021, according to Argentina's statistics agency INDEC.[^41] This trend continued in 2025, with wages rising by 20.7% in the first half of the year compared to inflation of 15.1%.[^42]

**International Relations**: Milei negotiated a $20 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, reversing Argentina's precarious position with the institution.[^43] Argentina also paid off $4.3 billion in debt, and investor confidence soared, pushing bond prices higher.[^44] The country signed a free trade deal with the European Union, and credit ratings improved significantly.[^45] According to Gallup, public confidence in the economy reached heights not seen since 2015 by the end of 2024.[^46]

**Deregulation**: Milei removed numerous regulatory roadblocks, including eliminating all electric vehicle charging restrictions, as part of his broader philosophy to "get the state out of the way" and promote economic growth.[^47]

**Political Consolidation**: In October 2025, Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, won a landslide victory in midterm elections, securing over 40 percent of the popular vote and earning 64 of the 127 seats at stake in the Chamber of Deputies and 20 of the 24 Senate seats renewed.[^48] This electoral triumph gave Milei a stronger mandate to continue his radical reforms.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his economic achievements, Milei's presidency has generated intense controversy and criticism across multiple dimensions of governance and policy.[^50]

**Abandonment of Dollarization**: Perhaps Milei's most significant broken campaign promise was his failure to implement dollarization—replacing Argentina's peso with the U.S. dollar—which had been his signature policy proposal throughout the 2023 campaign.[^51] After taking office, Milei blamed politics for being unable to fulfill this promise, suggesting that dollarization could have led to his impeachment and that "politics was going to play dirty."[^52] Critics, including economists and the Supreme Court (which claimed eliminating the peso was "unconstitutional"), warned that dollarization could have pushed Argentina into severe depression with increased unemployment and poverty, especially since the country lacked enough dollars to replace its monetary base.[^53] By keeping currency and capital controls in place, critics argue Milei jeopardized his anti-inflationary program and discouraged potential investment.[^54]

**Human Costs of Austerity**: The social impact of Milei's "chainsaw economics" has been devastating for many Argentines. In the eight months after taking office, prices soared more than 100%, consumer spending collapsed, and unemployment climbed under what has been described as the most brutal austerity shock in recent history.[^55] Poverty rates surged from 41.7% to a peak of 52.9% during the first six months of his presidency—meaning more than half of Argentines lived below the poverty line.[^56] While poverty subsequently declined to 38.1% by the third quarter of 2024, with UNICEF noting that 1.7 million children were lifted out of poverty, the initial surge caused immense hardship.[^57] As spending was slashed by the most in 30 years, homelessness rose, with entire families begging outside supermarkets.[^58] Real pensions and public wages were cut, and public infrastructure projects were halted.[^59]

**Attacks on Women's Rights and Gender Policies**: Shortly after taking office, Milei's government dismantled the Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity, transferring its responsibilities to the Ministry of Human Capital.[^60] Milei has asserted that "violence does not have gender," and in February 2024, his government declared its intention to prohibit "anything related to gender perspective" within the national administration.[^61] Austerity measures significantly reduced funds allocated to gender policies, with state spending on public policies addressing gender inequality slashed by 33%.[^62] Human Rights Watch condemned Milei for employing misogynistic rhetoric during his campaign and attacking the feminist movement, escalating his rhetoric against advocates for women's rights upon taking office.[^63]

**Anti-Abortion Stance**: Milei opposes abortion even in cases of rape, supporting it only when the mother's life is endangered.[^64] He has indicated plans to hold a referendum on Argentina's 2020 abortion legalization law and support its repeal, with his political party presenting a draft bill in Congress to recriminalize abortion.[^65] The bill outlined that women who have terminations and those who perform them would face prison sentences.[^66] Milei has described abortion as "aggravated murder."[^67]

**Anti-LGBT Rhetoric**: In a January 2025 speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Milei argued there was an "LGBT agenda," saying, "In its most extreme version, gender ideology simply and plainly constitutes child abuse. They're pedophiles."[^68] The allegory was condemned by LGBTQ+ activists and largely discredited, with a national deputy condemning Milei for using "stigmatizing" and "abhorrent" cases to attack the LGBTQ+ community.[^69] Milei described "the LGBT lobby," alongside the climate change movement and abortion, as part of a "socialist agenda."[^70]

**Democratic Concerns**: Human Rights Watch criticized Milei's government, warning that its first year of office led to "institutional deterioration" in Argentina, highlighting excessive use of police force, high child poverty rates, and Milei's discriminatory rhetoric.[^71] Critics note that Milei has leaned heavily on executive decrees, vetoes, and other executive tools to bypass congressional gridlock, triggering debate about democratic norms.[^72] His Vice President Victoria Villarruel's ties to dictatorship-era figures have also concerned some moderates.[^73]

**Central Bank Controversy**: While Milei campaigned on abolishing the Central Bank of Argentina (which he called "the worst garbage that exists on this Earth" and "one of the greatest thieveries in human history"), he has not fulfilled this promise, stating it is "non-negotiable" but effectively shelving the plan.[^74][^75]

## Personal Life

Javier Milei remains unmarried and childless, describing himself as devoted primarily to his work and his unusual family of cloned dogs.[^76] His most important human relationship is with his younger sister Karina, two years his junior, who has played a pivotal role in managing his life, providing emotional support, and serving as his chief campaign strategist.[^77] Milei has described Karina as his "boss" and even his "Moses," likening himself to Aaron—a biblical reference that underscores the extraordinary influence she wields over his political and personal decisions.[^78]

The most distinctive and widely discussed aspect of Milei's personal life involves his deep emotional attachment to his dogs, particularly an English Mastiff named Conan. The original Conan (2004-2017) was adopted by Milei as a puppy in 2004 and named after the title character in the 1982 film "Conan the Barbarian."[^79] Milei referred to Conan as his closest friend and confidant during years when he felt isolated and misunderstood.[^80] When Conan died from spinal cancer in May 2017, Milei was devastated.[^81]

In what became one of the most unusual aspects of his public profile, Milei paid approximately $50,000 to the U.S. company PerPETuate in 2018 to clone Conan using preserved DNA.[^82] The procedure resulted in five puppies, whom Milei named after the original Conan and prominent economists from the Chicago and Austrian schools: Murray (after Murray Rothbard), Milton (after Milton Friedman), Robert, and Lucas (both named after Robert Lucas Jr.).[^83] Milei does not distinguish between the current cloned Conan and the original, considering both to be his son, and the other puppies his grandchildren.[^84]

Most controversially, Milei has claimed to receive policy and campaign advice from his dogs through a medium, and publicly thanked them after his win in the 2023 Argentine primary elections.[^85] After the original Conan's death, Milei visited a medium to communicate with his deceased pet, and during that conversation, Milei said Conan gave him the task of becoming president of Argentina—a directive he claims motivated his political ambitions.[^86] These claims have been simultaneously mocked by critics and embraced by supporters as evidence of his unconventional authenticity. Milei himself reflected on his unusual journey, stating: "My journey has been unconventional—I've been a goalkeeper, a rock and roll band singer, and an economist."[^87]

## Legacy

Although Javier Milei's presidency is still in its early years, his radical economic experiment and polarizing political approach have already begun shaping his legacy and generating intense debate about his historical significance.[^88]

**Economic Transformation**: Milei's most enduring legacy may be proving—or disproving—whether radical libertarian "shock therapy" can successfully address chronic inflation and economic dysfunction in a major Latin American economy. His dramatic reduction of inflation from over 25% monthly to under 2%, achievement of Argentina's first budget surplus in 14 years, and stabilization of the peso represent accomplishments that even his critics acknowledge.[^89] Supporters from libertarian think tanks like the Mises Institute and the Cato Institute argue that Milei has demonstrated the effectiveness of Austrian School economics in practice, providing a real-world case study for free-market policies.[^90] His success in making severe austerity politically popular—winning a landslide midterm election after implementing punishing cuts—challenges conventional wisdom about the political sustainability of fiscal consolidation.[^91]

**Global Libertarian Movement**: Milei has become an international icon for the libertarian movement, frequently appearing at events like the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and delivering speeches at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he condemned socialism and defended free-market capitalism.[^92] His 2024 Davos speech, where he declared "the Western world is in danger" from socialist ideology, and his 2025 return where he listed figures like Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, Viktor Orban, Giorgia Meloni, and Nayib Bukele as his partners, positioned him as a leader of a new international right-wing movement.[^93] Whether his economic policies succeed or fail will significantly influence the credibility of libertarian economics globally.[^94]

**Social and Political Divisions**: Milei's confrontational style, attacks on "wokism," feminism, LGBT rights, and what he calls the "socialist agenda," combined with his dismantling of gender-focused government institutions, has left deep social divisions in Argentina.[^95] His employment of misogynistic rhetoric, opposition to abortion rights, and inflammatory statements about LGBT individuals have energized social conservatives but alienated progressives and human rights organizations.[^96] Human Rights Watch's warning about "institutional deterioration" and concerns about democratic norms suggest his governance style may have lasting implications for Argentine democracy.[^97]

**Poverty and Inequality**: The human cost of Milei's austerity measures—particularly the surge in poverty rates and homelessness during his first months—remains a central component of how history may judge him. While poverty has declined from its peak and wages have begun outpacing inflation, critics argue his policies benefited the wealthy while disadvantaging the poorest Argentines.[^98] Whether the economic recovery ultimately lifts more Argentines out of poverty or entrenches inequality will significantly shape his legacy.

**Political Realignment**: Milei represents a dramatic departure from Argentina's traditional political landscape dominated by Peronism and conventional center-right parties. His success in building La Libertad Avanza into a dominant political force through the 2025 midterm landslide suggests a potential realignment of Argentine politics around new ideological axes.[^99] His description of Argentina as "an example of a new way of doing politics, which is about telling people the truth to their faces" reflects his self-perception as a transformational rather than transactional leader.[^100]

**International Relations**: Milei's foreign policy legacy includes Argentina's unprecedented alignment with the United States under Donald Trump, strong support for Israel (including plans to move Argentina's embassy to Jerusalem), condemnation of "communist" nations like China, and integration with right-wing populist leaders globally.[^101] This represents a significant shift from Argentina's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy and may have long-term implications for the country's international relationships and trade partnerships.

Ultimately, Milei's legacy will depend substantially on whether Argentina's economic recovery continues, whether inflation remains controlled without dollarization, and whether the social costs of his policies are viewed as necessary medicine or unnecessary cruelty. As one analysis noted, his success or failure will be studied by political scientists and economists for decades as either vindication or cautionary tale of radical free-market reform.[^102]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Javier Milei's presidency, particularly from libertarian and free-market economics circles, emphasize his remarkable achievements in economic stabilization and his courage in implementing reforms that conventional politicians avoided.[^103]

The Mises Institute, a libertarian think tank dedicated to Austrian School economics, has praised Milei's economic understanding and his application of theories from Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, and Friedrich Hayek to real-world governance.[^104] Scholars from institutions like Econlib have argued that Milei demonstrates sophisticated economic understanding, particularly in his recognition that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon requiring strict control of the money supply.[^105] These analysts note that 108 economists who signed a statement opposing Milei's economic proposals in fall 2023—including French economist Thomas Piketty—have been proven dramatically wrong by the results, with inflation falling far faster than critics predicted.[^106]

Supporters highlight that Milei inherited an economy on the verge of collapse, with monthly inflation at 25.5% and annual inflation exceeding 211%, and managed to stabilize it without the hyperinflation that many economists predicted his policies would trigger.[^107] The achievement of Argentina's first budget surplus in 14 years, the strengthening of the peso, wage growth outpacing inflation, and declining poverty from its peak are cited as evidence that short-term pain has yielded sustainable recovery.[^108] As one supportive analysis noted, "Milei has been in office long enough that we are now seeing good results from his 30 percent cut in government spending."[^109]

Defenders argue that Milei's willingness to "tell people the truth to their faces"—that Argentina could not sustain its bloated public sector, chronic deficits, and monetary irresponsibility—represents a refreshing departure from politicians who make unsustainable promises.[^110] His landslide victory in the October 2025 midterm elections, winning over 40% of the popular vote after implementing severe austerity, suggests that many Argentines view his policies as necessary and effective.[^111] The Hoover Institution published analysis titled "Critics Of Milei's Policies Strike Out," arguing that academic critics underestimated both the necessity of his reforms and his political skill in implementing them.[^112]

International supporters, including figures in the Trump administration and conservative movements in the United States and Europe, view Milei as a champion of individual liberty against collectivist ideology.[^113] His speeches at Davos condemning socialism and defending free-market capitalism have made him an intellectual leader of the international libertarian movement.[^114] Supporters argue that if Milei succeeds in transforming Argentina from economic basket case to prosperity, it will vindicate decades of Austrian School economic theory and provide a model for other struggling economies.[^115]

### Negative Views

Critics of Javier Milei's presidency, including progressive economists, political scientists, human rights organizations, and social justice advocates, paint a far darker picture of his governance and its consequences for Argentina.[^116]

Political scientists have published research in journals like the Latin American Research Review describing Milei's approach as "authoritarian liberalism"—a troubling combination of economic libertarianism with anti-democratic tendencies, attacks on civil society, and erosion of institutional checks on executive power.[^117] Scholars analyzing his political discourse find "crucial contradictions, particularly between economic libertarianism having its roots in radical individualism on the one hand and populist rhetoric which should be based on the concept of the 'people' on the other."[^118] Research published in MDPI's Social Sciences journal concluded that Milei is "at best a partial populist" who lacks a genuine people-centered vision and is instead anchored solely in market rationality.[^119]

Human Rights Watch issued a scathing assessment, warning that Milei's first year led to "institutional deterioration" in Argentina, highlighting excessive use of police force, discriminatory rhetoric against women and LGBT individuals, and attacks on civil society organizations.[^120] The organization emphasized that Milei's anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, including calling gender ideology "child abuse" and LGBT activists "pedophiles," has potential to incite violence against vulnerable communities.[^121] His dismantling of the Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity and slashing of funding for gender equality programs by 33% represent what critics describe as a war on women's rights.[^122]

Progressive economists and organizations like Equality Now have condemned the human costs of Milei's austerity measures, particularly the surge in poverty to 52.9% during his first six months and the rise in homelessness, with entire families reduced to begging.[^123] While Milei's supporters celebrate budget surpluses and declining inflation, critics argue these achievements came through transferring wealth from the poorest Argentines to bondholders and the wealthy.[^124] The American Prospect published analysis titled "Make Argentina Crash Again: On Milei's Neoliberal Experiment," arguing that his policies represent a dangerous replay of failed neoliberal experiments from previous decades.[^125]

Academic analyses published in journals like Schiller International University's research series question whether Milei's project is genuinely liberal or merely populist authoritarianism dressed in libertarian language.[^126] Political scientist Pablo Stefanoni argues that Milei exemplifies how "the new right has constructed its discourse and found its identity as a rebel actor against political correctness and social justice narrative," using libertarian economics as a vehicle for reactionary social politics.[^127] A critical academic paper titled "¿Viva la Libertad? A Critical Analysis of Javier Milei's" published by Sciences Po's OPALC program argues that his policies prioritize market fundamentalism over human welfare.[^128]

Critics note that Milei abandoned his signature dollarization promise, kept capital controls in place despite his free-market rhetoric, and has not actually closed the Central Bank despite calling it "the worst garbage that exists on this Earth."[^129] These broken promises, critics argue, reveal either incompetence or cynical dishonesty.[^130] Atlantic Council analysts suggest that by backing away from dollarization, Milei jeopardized his entire anti-inflationary program and may have only temporarily suppressed inflation rather than solving the underlying monetary dysfunction.[^131]

The scholarly consensus among critics appears to be that while Milei has achieved some short-term macroeconomic stabilization, he has done so at enormous human cost, through erosion of democratic institutions, and without addressing the structural problems that have plagued Argentina for decades—leaving the country vulnerable to future crises once the initial shock wears off.[^132]
