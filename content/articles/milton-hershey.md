## Summary

Milton Snavely Hershey (1857-1945) was an American confectioner and philanthropist who founded the Hershey Chocolate Company and transformed the American chocolate industry. Born into a Mennonite family in rural Pennsylvania, Hershey experienced multiple business failures before revolutionizing chocolate manufacturing by creating an affordable milk chocolate product for the mass market. Beyond his industrial achievements, Hershey established a model industrial town, a renowned school for orphaned boys, and became one of America's greatest philanthropists, ultimately donating his entire fortune to charitable causes. His legacy encompasses both the democratization of chocolate consumption in America and the creation of enduring educational and social institutions.

## Early Life and Background

Milton Snavely Hershey was born on September 13, 1857, in a small farmhouse near Derry Church, Pennsylvania, in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country. He was born into a Mennonite family; his father, Henry Hershey, was a dreamer and perpetual entrepreneur who moved the family frequently in pursuit of various unsuccessful business ventures, while his mother, Veronica "Fanny" Snavely Hershey, provided stability and practical wisdom. The constant relocations and his father's failures profoundly shaped young Milton's character, instilling both an entrepreneurial spirit and a determination to succeed where his father had not.[^1]

Hershey's formal education was limited and fragmented due to his family's frequent moves. He attended seven different schools before his education effectively ended at the fourth grade when he was just thirteen years old. Despite this limited schooling, Hershey was intelligent and possessed a keen business sense that would later prove invaluable. His mother, recognizing that formal education was impractical given their circumstances, arranged for Milton to apprentice with a printer in Gap, Pennsylvania. However, this apprenticeship ended in failure when young Milton accidentally dropped his hat into the printing press machinery, leading to his dismissal.[^2]

Following this setback, in 1872, fifteen-year-old Milton was apprenticed to Joseph Royer, a confectioner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. This four-year apprenticeship proved transformative, as Hershey discovered both a talent and a passion for candy making. He learned the fundamentals of confectionery, including how to make various candies, caramels, and other sweets. Royer was a skilled craftsman who taught Hershey the importance of quality ingredients and meticulous technique. The experience in Lancaster's confectionery shops exposed Hershey to the possibilities of the candy business and planted the seeds for his future empire.[^3]

The values instilled during Hershey's youth—hard work, persistence, and a commitment to quality—would guide him throughout his life. His Mennonite upbringing emphasized community, simplicity, and helping others, principles that later manifested in his philanthropic endeavors and his creation of a model industrial town. The contrast between his father's constant failures and his mother's steady support taught Hershey the importance of both innovation and practical business management, a balance that would prove crucial to his eventual success.[^4]

## Rise to Power

After completing his apprenticeship in 1876, nineteen-year-old Milton Hershey, with financial backing from his mother and her family, opened his first candy shop in Philadelphia during the nation's Centennial celebration. Despite the promising timing and his skills as a confectioner, the venture failed after six years. Hershey's inexperience in business management, combined with his father's interference (Henry Hershey joined the business and made poor decisions), led to the shop's closure in 1882. This failure left Hershey deeply in debt and demonstrated that skill in candy making alone was insufficient for business success.[^5]

Undeterred, Hershey moved to Denver, Colorado, where he worked for a confectioner and learned a crucial technique: adding fresh milk to caramel to create a superior product. This seemingly simple innovation would prove foundational to his future success. After brief, unsuccessful attempts to establish businesses in Chicago, New Orleans, and New York City—all of which failed—Hershey returned to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1883, essentially penniless at age twenty-six. Many would have abandoned their dreams after such repeated failures, but Hershey's determination remained unshaken.[^6]

In 1886, Hershey founded the Lancaster Caramel Company, applying the fresh milk technique he had learned in Denver. This time, success came rapidly. The quality of his milk caramels, which were superior to competitors' products, attracted significant orders. A critical breakthrough came when a British importer placed a large order, providing Hershey with the capital and credibility he needed. Within a decade, the Lancaster Caramel Company had become one of the leading caramel manufacturers in the United States, with factories in Lancaster, Mount Joy, and Reading, Pennsylvania, as well as Geneva and Chicago, Illinois.[^7]

The turning point toward chocolate came in 1893 when Hershey visited the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and encountered German chocolate-making machinery on display. Fascinated by the possibilities of chocolate manufacturing, Hershey purchased the equipment and began experimenting with chocolate coating for his caramels. He quickly realized that chocolate represented a greater opportunity than caramels. At the time, chocolate was a luxury product in America, consumed primarily by the wealthy, as most chocolate was imported from Europe and produced by hand in small batches.[^8]

Hershey became obsessed with developing a formula for affordable, mass-produced milk chocolate. While Swiss manufacturers like Daniel Peter and Henri Nestlé had created milk chocolate in the 1870s, their formulas were closely guarded secrets, and their products remained expensive. Hershey spent years experimenting with different combinations of milk, sugar, and cocoa. The challenge was creating a stable milk chocolate that wouldn't spoil and could be mass-produced at an affordable price. After countless failures, Hershey finally developed a successful formula, though he kept the exact process proprietary.[^9]

In 1900, demonstrating remarkable confidence in his vision, Hershey sold the Lancaster Caramel Company for $1 million (approximately $35 million in today's dollars), retaining only the chocolate manufacturing equipment and rights. This decision shocked many business observers, as he was selling a proven, profitable business to focus entirely on an uncertain chocolate venture. However, Hershey had identified a transformative opportunity: creating an American mass market for milk chocolate by making it affordable to ordinary working-class families rather than just the wealthy elite.[^10]

## Major Achievements

Hershey's most significant achievement was revolutionizing the American chocolate industry by creating the first mass-market milk chocolate product. In 1900, he launched the Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar, followed in 1907 by Hershey's Kisses. These products were innovative not just in their formulation but in their pricing and distribution strategy. By developing efficient manufacturing processes and economies of scale, Hershey reduced the price of chocolate to a level affordable to average American workers. Prior to Hershey, chocolate was largely a luxury good; afterward, it became an everyday treat accessible to all social classes.[^11]

The Hershey manufacturing process represented a significant technological achievement. While the exact formula remained a trade secret, Hershey developed a method for creating shelf-stable milk chocolate using fresh milk from local dairy farms. The process involved controlling milk condensation and mixing it precisely with cocoa and sugar to create a distinctive flavor profile. Hershey invested heavily in mechanization, creating assembly-line production techniques that anticipated Henry Ford's later innovations in automobile manufacturing. By 1905, the Hershey Chocolate Company factory could produce chocolate at a volume and price point unprecedented in American history.[^12]

Beyond manufacturing innovation, Hershey created an entirely new business model by building a company town around his chocolate factory. In 1903, he broke ground on a new factory in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, near his birthplace, where he had access to fresh milk from local dairy farms and good transportation via railroad. Rather than simply building a factory, Hershey envisioned a complete community that would provide workers with exceptional living conditions. He personally financed the construction of houses, schools, parks, a trolley system, a department store, a bank, a hotel, a zoo, a sports arena, and other amenities.[^13]

The town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, became a model of progressive industrial planning. Streets were named after cocoa-producing regions (like Chocolate Avenue and Cocoa Avenue), and the town was designed with parks, tree-lined streets, and recreational facilities. Workers' houses were well-built and affordable, a stark contrast to the tenement conditions in many industrial cities of the era. Hershey believed that happy, healthy workers would be more productive and loyal, and his approach proved successful. The company experienced lower turnover and higher productivity than many competitors, and the town became a tourist destination, further promoting the Hershey brand.[^14]

Hershey's greatest philanthropic achievement was the founding of the Hershey Industrial School (later renamed Milton Hershey School) in 1909. Hershey and his wife Catherine, who were unable to have children of their own, established the school to provide free education, housing, and care for orphaned boys. The school was revolutionary in its comprehensive approach, providing not just academic education but vocational training, healthcare, moral instruction, and a family-like environment. Each student was placed in a home with houseparents who provided individual attention and guidance.[^15]

In 1918, after his wife's death, Hershey made an extraordinary philanthropic gesture that remains one of the largest charitable donations in American history. He transferred the majority of his wealth—his controlling shares in the Hershey Chocolate Company, valued initially at about $60 million—to the Hershey Trust, which funded the school. This endowment meant that the school would receive the profits and dividends from the chocolate company in perpetuity, ensuring its financial stability regardless of economic conditions. Today, the Milton Hershey School Trust controls about 80% of the voting shares of The Hershey Company, and the school serves over 2,000 students completely free of charge.[^16]

During the Great Depression, Hershey's commitment to his community was tested and proved resolute. While many businesses laid off workers and cut costs, Hershey embarked on an ambitious building program, a deliberate strategy he called a "Great Building Campaign." Between 1933 and 1937, he financed the construction of numerous civic buildings in Hershey, including the Hershey Community Building, a grand hotel (the Hotel Hershey), a sports arena, and improvements to the park and zoo. This construction provided employment to thousands of workers during the Depression's darkest years and ensured that Hershey's employees maintained their livelihoods when much of the nation suffered mass unemployment.[^17]

Hershey's innovations extended to marketing and distribution. He pioneered national distribution networks for perishable food products, creating a system of regional distribution centers that could deliver fresh chocolate across the country. His advertising, while modest by later standards, effectively positioned Hershey chocolate as a wholesome, American product suitable for children and families. The distinctive Hershey's Kiss shape, wrapped in foil with a paper plume, became an iconic American symbol. By the time of Hershey's death, Hershey's chocolate products were available in virtually every corner store, drugstore, and market in America.[^18]

Hershey's business also made significant contributions during World War II. The company developed the Ration D Bar, a special chocolate bar designed for U.S. military personnel that could withstand high temperatures without melting and provided quick energy. The company produced over 3 billion ration bars during the war, and Hershey's chocolate became associated with American GIs and the war effort. This association further solidified Hershey's position as a quintessentially American brand and contributed to the company's post-war dominance in the domestic chocolate market.[^19]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his philanthropic reputation, Hershey faced significant labor controversies that revealed the paternalistic and authoritarian aspects of his management philosophy. In April 1937, workers at the Hershey Chocolate factory went on strike, demanding union recognition, higher wages, and better working conditions. The strike turned violent when over 1,000 local dairy farmers and other Hershey loyalists, concerned about the impact on the town's economy, forcibly removed the striking workers from the factory in what became known as the "Hershey Strike Riot." Several strikers were injured in the confrontation, and Pennsylvania state police had to intervene to restore order.[^20]

The 1937 strike exposed contradictions in Hershey's approach to labor relations. While he provided superior housing, recreation, and community facilities compared to most industrial employers of the era, Hershey maintained tight control over his workers' lives and resisted any form of independent worker organization. He viewed unions as unnecessary interference in his relationship with his employees and believed that his paternalistic benevolence should be sufficient to ensure worker satisfaction. This attitude was not uncommon among progressive employers of the era, but it reflected a failure to recognize workers' desires for collective bargaining power and self-determination.[^21]

Hershey's company town model, while progressive in many respects, also represented a form of corporate control over workers' lives that some critics found troubling. Residents of Hershey were not just employees but also tenants, customers at company stores, and users of company services. This arrangement created dependencies that limited workers' autonomy and made it difficult for them to organize or protest conditions without risking not just their jobs but their entire way of life. The company's dominance over the town meant that dissent could result in comprehensive social and economic consequences.[^22]

The Milton Hershey School, despite its generous endowment and mission, has faced recurring controversies regarding its admissions policies and treatment of students. Historically, the school excluded African American students until 1968, long after the civil rights movement had made such discrimination indefensible. This exclusion reflected broader patterns of racial discrimination in American society, but it was particularly disappointing given Hershey's progressive claims and substantial resources. The school also excluded girls until 1977, limiting its impact and reflecting gendered assumptions about education and opportunity.[^23]

More recently, the Milton Hershey School has faced criticism for its restrictive admissions criteria and for denying admission to children based on medical conditions, disability, or family circumstances that administrators deemed too challenging. Several lawsuits have been filed by families whose children were denied admission or expelled due to HIV-positive status, behavior issues, or other factors. Critics argue that a school with such enormous financial resources (the trust is valued at over $17 billion as of 2025) should be able to accommodate a wider range of children in need, including those with complex medical or behavioral challenges.[^24]

Questions have been raised about the governance and spending priorities of the Hershey Trust and Milton Hershey School. Despite the massive endowment, the school serves approximately 2,000 students, leading some critics to argue that the resources could benefit far more children if deployed differently. The trust's control over The Hershey Company has also created occasional conflicts between the trust's fiduciary duty to maximize returns for the school and the company's business interests. Several controversies have emerged when the trust considered selling the company or when questions arose about whether the trust's voting power was being exercised in the best interests of the school or other stakeholders.[^25]

Hershey's chocolate formula itself became a subject of criticism in later years, particularly from chocolate connoisseurs and competitors. The distinctive tangy, slightly sour note in Hershey's milk chocolate, which results from the manufacturing process Hershey developed, is off-putting to some consumers, especially those accustomed to European chocolates. Some food scientists have noted that the flavor profile includes notes similar to butyric acid, which is also present in vomit and rancid butter. While Americans who grew up with Hershey's chocolate often enjoy this distinctive taste, it has limited Hershey's appeal in international markets where consumers prefer different flavor profiles.[^26]

Environmental and labor critics have also noted that Hershey, like other chocolate manufacturers, has historically been slow to address issues in its cocoa supply chain, particularly the use of child labor on West African cocoa farms. While these problems emerged more prominently after Milton Hershey's death, they reflect structural issues in the chocolate industry that Hershey helped create, including pressure for low commodity prices that incentivize exploitative labor practices. The Hershey Company has made commitments to sustainable sourcing in recent years, but implementation has been gradual and incomplete.[^27]

## Personal Life

Milton Hershey married Catherine "Kitty" Sweeney in 1898, when he was forty-one and she was twenty-six. Catherine, who worked at a candy shop in Jamestown, New York, was of Irish Catholic background, which required some negotiation given Hershey's Mennonite family traditions. The couple's marriage was reportedly happy, and Catherine became deeply involved in Milton's philanthropic work, particularly the planning of the Hershey Industrial School. Her influence was evident in the school's emphasis on creating a nurturing, family-like environment for orphaned children.[^28]

Tragically, the Hersheys were unable to have children of their own, a disappointment that profoundly affected both of them. This personal loss became a powerful motivator for their philanthropic work with children. Catherine's health was never robust; she suffered from a progressive muscular disorder that gradually debilitated her. Despite her illness, she remained actively involved in planning the school and town until her condition deteriorated. Milton was devoted to her care, seeking treatments from specialists across the country and in Europe, but medical science of the era could not halt her decline.[^29]

Catherine Hershey died in 1915 at age forty-three, leaving Milton devastated. He never remarried, and her death marked a turning point in his life. Following her death, Hershey became even more focused on philanthropic work, viewing it as a continuation of their shared mission. In 1918, he made his massive donation of company stock to the Hershey Trust in her memory, ensuring that their vision for helping children would outlive them both. The Catherine Hershey School for Girls (later merged with the boys' school to form the co-educational Milton Hershey School) was established to honor her legacy.[^30]

Hershey was known for his simplicity and lack of pretension despite his enormous wealth. He dressed modestly, lived relatively simply (though comfortably), and was often seen walking around the town and factory, talking with workers and residents. He was approachable and unpretentious, qualities that endeared him to many employees and town residents. However, he could also be stubborn and autocratic, expecting his vision to be implemented without question and resistant to advice that contradicted his instincts. Those who worked closely with him described him as demanding but fair, with exacting standards for quality and efficiency.[^31]

In his later years, Hershey remained actively involved in his businesses and philanthropic endeavors despite his advancing age. He continued to visit the factory regularly and took particular interest in the Milton Hershey School, often visiting students and monitoring the school's operations. He maintained a lifelong interest in Cuba, where he had established sugar plantations and a mill to supply his chocolate factory, and he spent winters there. Hershey's interest in Cuba reflected both business pragmatism (securing his sugar supply) and a genuine fascination with the island and its people.[^32]

Hershey's personality combined idealism with hard-nosed business acumen. He genuinely believed in creating opportunity and improving lives, but he also expected loyalty, hard work, and adherence to his vision in return. His philanthropy was generous but also controlling; he wanted to see his money used in specific ways that reflected his values and vision. This paternalistic approach was characteristic of many wealthy industrialists of his generation, who saw themselves as benevolent stewards responsible for guiding those less fortunate.[^33]

## Legacy

Milton Hershey's death on October 13, 1945, at age eighty-eight, marked the end of an era, but his legacy has endured and grown in the decades since. The Hershey Company evolved from a regional chocolate manufacturer into a global confectionery giant, with brands including Reese's, Kit Kat (in the U.S.), Twizzlers, and many others. As of 2025, The Hershey Company generates over $10 billion in annual revenue and remains one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. The company's success has ensured the continued prosperity of the Milton Hershey School and the town of Hershey.[^34]

The Milton Hershey School stands as perhaps Hershey's most enduring legacy. With an endowment valued at over $17 billion, it is one of the wealthiest private schools in the world. The school has educated over 11,000 children since its founding, providing them with free education, housing, healthcare, and support from kindergarten through 12th grade. Alumni of the school include successful business leaders, educators, military officers, and community leaders who credit the school with transforming their lives. The school's existence demonstrates the long-term impact that thoughtful philanthropy can achieve.[^35]

The town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, remains a testament to Hershey's vision of a model industrial community, though it has evolved significantly since his death. With a population of over 14,000, Hershey has become a major tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors annually to attractions including Hersheypark (an amusement park), The Hershey Story Museum, Hershey's Chocolate World, and the historic Hotel Hershey. The town's economy remains closely tied to the chocolate company and tourism, creating both stability and vulnerability depending on the company's fortunes.[^36]

Hershey's approach to business influenced broader American corporate culture, particularly regarding corporate social responsibility. His model of building a company town with superior amenities, investing in employee welfare, and dedicating profits to philanthropy inspired other industrialists and contributed to Progressive Era reforms. While pure company towns have become less common, Hershey's legacy can be seen in modern corporate citizenship initiatives, employer-provided benefits, and corporate philanthropy programs that recognize business's broader social responsibilities.[^37]

The democratization of chocolate consumption in America represents another crucial aspect of Hershey's legacy. Before Hershey, chocolate was a luxury product; after Hershey, it became an everyday treat accessible to all economic classes. This transformation affected American food culture profoundly, making chocolate a standard part of celebrations, holidays, and daily life. The distinctive taste of Hershey's chocolate became, for many Americans, the defining flavor of chocolate itself, shaping taste preferences across generations.[^38]

Hershey's life story has become an enduring part of American mythology about entrepreneurship, persistence, and philanthropy. His narrative of repeated failures followed by spectacular success resonates with American ideals about determination and second chances. The fact that he ultimately gave away his fortune rather than founding a dynastic family wealth has enhanced his reputation, distinguishing him from other Gilded Age industrialists who primarily enriched their descendants. His example has inspired countless entrepreneurs and philanthropists to view business success as a platform for social good.[^39]

However, Hershey's legacy also includes problematic aspects that contemporary scholars have examined more critically. The paternalistic nature of his philanthropy, the labor conflicts at his factory, the historical exclusions in his school's admissions policies, and the environmental and social costs of industrial chocolate production represent shadows on his legacy. Modern assessments of Hershey increasingly balance celebration of his achievements with acknowledgment of his limitations and the contexts that shaped both his successes and failures.[^40]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and business scholars have consistently praised Hershey as an innovative entrepreneur who transformed American industry and philanthropy. Business historians like Michael D'Antonio, author of "Hershey: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams," credit Hershey with pioneering mass production techniques that made chocolate affordable to ordinary Americans and anticipating corporate social responsibility concepts that would not become mainstream for decades. D'Antonio argues that Hershey "created a new model for American capitalism, one that measured success not just in profits but in the well-being of workers and communities."[^41]

Philanthropy scholars regard Hershey as one of America's greatest benefactors, noting that his 1918 donation of his fortune to the Hershey Trust represents one of the most significant charitable gifts in American history. Joel Fleishman, in "The Foundation: A Great American Secret," highlights how Hershey's endowment structure ensured perpetual funding for his school, creating a sustainable model that has outlasted many other philanthropic initiatives. The scale of resources dedicated to helping disadvantaged children, and the comprehensiveness of the support provided, set standards that few other institutions have matched.[^42]

Educators and social workers have praised the Milton Hershey School's holistic approach to supporting disadvantaged children. The school's model of providing not just education but also housing, healthcare, nutrition, emotional support, and family-like structure in a residential setting has been studied as an effective intervention for at-risk youth. Research has shown that Milton Hershey School graduates achieve higher rates of college attendance, employment, and economic stability than comparable populations, demonstrating the positive impact of comprehensive support for disadvantaged children.[^43]

Urban planners and historians of industrial communities have examined Hershey, Pennsylvania, as an example of successful planned community development. Unlike many company towns that deteriorated into slums or became ghost towns when industries declined, Hershey evolved into a thriving, diversified community. Planning historians credit Hershey's vision of combining industrial development with high-quality residential areas, recreational facilities, and civic amenities as ahead of its time and influential in later community planning efforts.[^44]

Agricultural economists note that Hershey's emphasis on sourcing fresh milk from local dairy farms created economic opportunities for Pennsylvania farmers and established a successful model of vertical integration that benefited both the manufacturer and agricultural suppliers. By guaranteeing purchases and maintaining quality standards, Hershey helped professionalize dairy farming in central Pennsylvania and created stable markets that supported rural communities. This symbiotic relationship between industry and agriculture contributed to regional economic development.[^45]

### Negative Views

Labor historians have criticized Hershey's paternalistic approach to worker relations and his resistance to unionization. Irving Bernstein, in "The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941," describes the 1937 Hershey strike as exemplifying the conflicts between paternalistic employers and workers seeking collective bargaining rights. Bernstein argues that Hershey's provision of superior amenities, while genuine, was also a form of control that sought to prevent independent worker organization. The violence of the strike's resolution, with company loyalists forcibly removing strikers, revealed the authoritarian undercurrent beneath the benevolent surface.[^46]

Critical scholars of philanthropy question whether Hershey's approach represented the most effective use of enormous resources. Rob Reich, in "Just Giving: Why Philanthropy Is Failing Democracy and How It Can Do Better," uses examples like the Milton Hershey School to discuss how wealthy benefactors' specific visions can sometimes limit the flexibility and reach of charitable resources. Reich and others ask whether serving 2,000 students with a $17 billion endowment represents optimal resource allocation, or whether the same money could help more children through different organizational structures.[^47]

Civil rights historians have documented the Milton Hershey School's exclusion of African American students until 1968, noting that this policy persisted even after the Brown v. Board of Education decision mandated school desegregation. This exclusion, while consistent with broader patterns of discrimination in American society, was particularly disappointing given the school's vast resources and charitable mission. The delay in addressing racial discrimination suggests that Hershey's philanthropic vision had significant blind spots regarding racial justice.[^48]

Food and nutrition critics have examined the public health implications of Hershey's success in making chocolate widely available and affordable. While this democratization was celebrated as a business achievement, public health researchers note that it contributed to increased sugar consumption and its associated health problems. Marion Nestle and other nutrition scholars argue that the chocolate industry, which Hershey helped create in its modern form, has prioritized palatability and profits over nutrition, contributing to obesity and other diet-related health issues, particularly among children.[^49]

Postcolonial scholars and labor rights advocates have criticized the chocolate industry's historical dependence on exploitative labor practices in cocoa-producing regions, particularly West Africa. While these problems intensified after Hershey's death, they argue that the business model Hershey established—depending on cheap commodity cocoa to maintain affordable prices—created structural incentives for labor exploitation. Carol Off, in "Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet," examines how chocolate manufacturers' pressure for low cocoa prices has contributed to poverty and child labor in cocoa-growing regions.[^50]

Economic historians have questioned whether company towns like Hershey, despite their amenities, represented healthy economic development or created dependencies and vulnerabilities. When a single company dominates a community's economy, residents face significant risks if that company declines or relocates. The controversies that have emerged when the Hershey Trust considered selling The Hershey Company illustrate how the town's welfare remains tied to corporate decisions largely outside residents' control, a structural vulnerability inherent in the company town model.[^51]
