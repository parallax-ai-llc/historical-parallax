## Summary

Anthony de Mello was an Indian Jesuit priest, psychotherapist, and spiritual teacher whose books and workshops blended Christian mysticism with Hindu and Buddhist insights. His books, including Awareness, Sadhana, and The Song of the Bird, used parables and stories from multiple traditions to awaken spiritual awareness. His work was posthumously criticized by the Vatican for potential incompatibility with Catholic faith. He remains widely read across religious traditions.
