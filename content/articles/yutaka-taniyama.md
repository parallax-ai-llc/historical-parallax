## Summary

Yutaka Taniyama, together with Goro Shimura, formulated the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture linking elliptic curves to modular forms. This conjecture, proved by Andrew Wiles in 1995 as part of proving Fermat's Last Theorem, became one of the most important results in modern mathematics. He died tragically by suicide at age 31.
