## Summary

J.J. Thomson was a British physicist who discovered the electron in 1897 through his cathode ray experiments. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his research on the conduction of electricity by gases. His plum pudding model of the atom, though later superseded, was an important step in understanding atomic structure. Seven of his research students and his son went on to win Nobel Prizes.
