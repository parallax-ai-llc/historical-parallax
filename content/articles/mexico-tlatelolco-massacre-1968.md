## Summary

Ten days before Mexico City was to host the 1968 Summer Olympics—the first in Latin America—the Mexican government massacred its own students. On October 2, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas at Tlatelolco, soldiers surrounded a peaceful student demonstration and opened fire. By official count, 26 died. By most estimates, 300 to 400. The exact number remains unknown because the government spent decades hiding the truth.[^1]

The 1968 student movement in Mexico paralleled uprisings in Paris, Prague, and American campuses. Students demanded political freedom, an end to authoritarianism, and release of political prisoners. The one-party state (the PRI had ruled since 1929) responded first with police, then with tanks, and finally with bullets. The massacre at Tlatelolco was planned: documents later revealed that government snipers started the shooting to provoke the military into firing on the crowd.[^2]

For decades, speaking of Tlatelolco was taboo. The government controlled the media; the truth was suppressed. Only in 1998, when documents were finally opened, did the full horror emerge. No one was ever punished for the killings. The soldiers who fired were never charged. The politicians who ordered it died in their beds. But every October 2, Mexicans march to remember—and to demand that their government finally account for what it did.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Mexico Under the PRI

**Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI):**

- In power since 1929
- One-party state with democratic facade
- Elections held; opposition allowed—but PRI always won
- Called "perfect dictatorship" by Vargas Llosa

**President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (1964-1970):**

- Intolerant of dissent[^4]

### The Student Movement

**1968: Year of global revolt:**

- Paris May '68
- Prague Spring
- US antiwar protests
- Mexico joined the wave

**Origins (July 1968):**

- July 22: Fight between students from rival schools
- Police intervention disproportionately violent
- Students from UNAM (National University) and IPN joined in solidarity
- Movement grew rapidly

**Demands:**

1. Free political prisoners
2. Abolish the granaderos (riot police)
3. Dismiss police chiefs
4. Repeal laws criminalizing "social dissolution"
5. Compensation for victims of police violence
6. Determine responsibility for violence

**The movement was not revolutionary—it was reformist.** But the government saw an existential threat.[^5]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Immediate:**

- Government wanted to crush movement before Olympics
- Believed in conspiracy theories about students
- Díaz Ordaz paranoid about communism

**Structural:**

- Authoritarian one-party state
- No tolerance for dissent
- Military impunity
- Press subservience

### Comparison to Other 1968 Events

| Event                    | Deaths      | Accountability |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Paris May '68            | 7           | Some           |
| Chicago Convention       | 0           | Some           |
| Prague (Soviet invasion) | 72          | None (Soviet)  |
| **Tlatelolco**           | **300-400** | **None**       |

**Mexico 1968 was bloodier than any Western 1968 event—and had less accountability.**

### Long-Term Impact

- Trauma for a generation

- Contributed to eventual PRI decline (lost presidency 2000)
