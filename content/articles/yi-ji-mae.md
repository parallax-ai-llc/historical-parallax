## Summary

Yi Ji-mae, commonly known as Iljimae (일지매), is a legendary Korean folk hero and gentleman thief whose name literally translates to "One Plum Blossom." Originating from Chinese Ming Dynasty folklore, the character became deeply embedded in Korean culture during the Joseon period, representing Korea's answer to Robin Hood—a masked vigilante who robbed corrupt officials to help the poor, leaving a single plum blossom as his calling card. While not a historical figure, Iljimae has transcended fictional origins to become an enduring symbol of social justice and resistance against corruption in Korean popular culture, inspiring numerous adaptations across comics, films, and television dramas that continue to resonate with modern audiences struggling with issues of inequality and systemic injustice.[^1][^2][^3]

---

## Origins and Literary Background

The character of Iljimae emerged as a fictional creation from various Ming Dynasty Chinese novels depicting a gentleman thief who leaves a plum blossom at the scene of every theft. During the Joseon period, when Chinese novels were being imported to Korea, the character crossed cultural boundaries and became popular in Korea, eventually being recognized as a folk hero rather than merely a fictional character.[^4][^5] The story's transmission from China to Korea exemplifies the cultural exchange that characterized East Asian literary traditions during this era.

The name "Iljimae" carries profound symbolic meaning: "il" means "one," "ji" means "branch," and "mae" means "plum tree," collectively translating to "one blossom branch" or "one plum branch."[^6] This nomenclature reflects the character's signature practice of leaving behind a handkerchief or painting portraying a branch of red plum blossoms at the scene of each robbery, serving as both his calling card and a symbol of his connection to nobility and virtue.[^7]

In Chinese adaptations, the character appears as Yi Zhi Mei (translated as "One Plum Blossom"), described as a Robin Hood-like figure who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. The story appeared in multiple Chinese productions including a 1960 Hong Kong television series, a 1994 film, a 2005 TVB production, and notably a 2010 Chinese television series called "The Vigilantes in Masks" based on folktales of this Ming Dynasty hero.[^8][^9]

The character has inspired many variants in popular culture, generally depicting Iljimae as a noble outlaw who helps the oppressed. Unlike many folk heroes whose origins can be traced to specific historical texts, Iljimae appears to derive from oral folklore traditions that were later compiled and adapted across multiple written and visual media formats.[^10]

## Cultural Significance in Korean Identity

Iljimae holds a unique position in Korean cultural consciousness as the nation's quintessential gentleman thief—a figure comparable to England's Robin Hood but infused with distinctly Korean values and historical context. The legend of Iljimae is Korea's version of Robin Hood, set during the Joseon dynasty, representing a masked vigilante who rose from humble beginnings to rob from the rich and fight for the poor while on a mission for revenge.[^11][^12]

The character's enduring appeal stems from his embodiment of resistance against the rigid class hierarchies that defined Joseon society. Korean folk heroes like Iljimae embody the collective aspirations of people who often found themselves under oppressive rule, challenging authority and fighting injustice as symbols of hope for the downtrodden.[^13] The emphasis on moral justice over legal justice in Korean folklore reflects skepticism about formal institutions, with heroes typically bypassing official channels to achieve justice.[^14]

The plum blossom symbolism integral to Iljimae's identity resonates deeply with Korean cultural values. In traditional Korean culture, plum blossoms symbolize the "noble mind" and the virtue of "patience," representing winter in the cycle of the four seasons and embodying Confucian traits such as purity, humility, and perseverance.[^15][^16] The plum blossom is known for its early blooming in harsh winter months, making it a symbol of resilience, hope, and the arrival of spring, viewed as a representation of perseverance and strength in the face of adversity.[^17]

The delicate but tenacious beauty of plum blossoms blanketed in late winter snow was taken by Confucian scholars as a metaphor for facing hardship with dignity and elegance.[^18] This symbolism reinforces Iljimae's role as a noble hero who perseveres through hardship to fight injustice and help the oppressed, with the plum blossom's five petals believed to carry five different blessings: wealth, health, virtue, peaceful death, and natural death.[^19]

Korean legends typically emphasize moral virtue and social justice over individual achievement, with heroes succeeding through wisdom, righteousness, and community support rather than personal glory.[^20] Iljimae's vigilante actions critique governmental greed, positioning him as a modern Robin Hood figure who redistributes wealth from the elite to the impoverished, thereby underscoring the era's systemic class disparities.[^21] These motifs extend to broader questions of identity and belonging, as protagonists grapple with their origins amid a rigid social hierarchy that punishes cross-class unions and abandons the vulnerable.[^22]

---

## The Joseon Dynasty Context

To understand Iljimae's significance, one must examine the historical context of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), during which the character's legend is set. The Joseon period was characterized by a rigid social hierarchy dominated by the yangban aristocratic class, which comprised highly educated civil officials and military officers constituting approximately 10% of the population.[^23][^24]

While the system appeared meritocratic in theory—allowing members of any social class except nobi (slaves), baekjeong (outcasts), and children of concubines to take government exams and become yangban—reality proved far different. In practice, only the upper classes possessed the financial resources and wherewithal to pass the exams, for which years of studying were required. These barriers and financial constraints effectively excluded most non-yangban families and the lower classes from competing for yangban status.[^25]

The yangban class became increasingly corrupt, particularly in the late Joseon period. Yangban aristocrats often received bribes and other illegal forms of payment in exchange for positions in the Royal Courts and the Military. Corrupt yangban also confiscated land from peasants by imposing ridiculously large taxes and then seizing the land when they could not pay.[^26] Yangban landlords, exempt from many direct taxes, frequently confiscated peasant holdings by imposing unpayable levies, converting freeholders into tenants or landless laborers.[^27]

After the Japanese invasions (1592-1598), many joined the yangban class by purchasing genealogies, and to fill the depleted state coffers, the government even resorted to selling yangban status.[^28] The system eventually deteriorated to the point where it was abolished in 1894 after a combination of internal corruption, foreign influence, and social unrest exposed the limits of the old aristocratic system, with reformers demanding an end to entrenched privilege and class inequality.[^29]

Theft was considered the most troublesome crime during the Joseon Dynasty, with people being relatively poor, so many crimes were related to theft for survival. However, under the agrarian society, theft was considered the most abominable crime imaginable, and the severest punishment was imposed upon thieves.[^30] According to the Great Ming Code, a first offense resulted in the word "thief" being tattooed on the criminal's right arm, a second offense in a tattoo on the left arm, and a third offense in strangulation.[^31]

This harsh legal environment makes Iljimae's status as a celebrated folk hero rather than a condemned criminal particularly significant—reflecting popular sentiment that elevated moral justice above legal compliance when the legal system itself served corrupt interests.

## Modern Adaptations and Cultural Revival

### Ko Woo-young's Groundbreaking Manhwa (1975-1977)

The modern revival of Iljimae began with Korean manhwa artist Ko Woo-young, who created the comic strip "Iljimae" serialized from 1975 to 1977 in the daily newspaper Ilgan Sport.[^32][^33] Ko Woo-young was one of the major manhwa artists active in South Korea during the 1970s and 1980s, truly coming to notice when he began making more personal works based on classical Korean and Chinese literature and folk stories for the daily newspaper starting in 1972.[^34]

In January 1972, Ilgan Sport began serialization of Ko Woo-young's "Im Keok-jeong," which was the first South Korean comics serial based on actual historical events and heralded in a new wave of adult-oriented manhwa.[^35] Ko Woo-young's "Iljimae" (1975-1977) starred a chivalrous Robin Hood-like bandit who steals from corrupt government officials and gives money to the poor people during the Joseon Kingdom.[^36]

The historical themes in Ko Woo-young's manhwas served as subtle metaphors and parodies of contemporary Korean society.[^37] Ko Woo-young showed the most Korean aesthetic in the comic world through brush touches reminiscent of the Joseon Dynasty, and literary expressions such as gags, humor, and reinterpretation that he incorporated were based on Korean language play and Korean culture. For this reason, Ko Woo-young is regarded as the godfather of true Korean cartoons.[^38]

Many parts of the original serialization had to be modified due to censorship in the 1970s and 1980s, reflecting the political climate of authoritarian South Korea.[^39] Interestingly, Ko Woo-young revealed that Iljimae, who has a "dirty personality" despite a feminine appearance, was the character he was most attached to, and he got the motif for Iljimae after seeing a book with a handsome man wearing a hat on the cover.[^40]

### Television Adaptations

The character of Iljimae has been adapted numerous times throughout Korean entertainment history across multiple decades:

**Early Adaptations:**
- 1961: "The Chivalrous Robber Il Ji Mae"
- 1976: "Righteous Fighter Il Ji Mae"
- 1978: "Flying Il Ji Mae"
- 1990: Modernized version starring Choi Su Jong
- Several animated versions[^41][^42]

**1993 MBC Series:**
Iljimae is a 1993 South Korean mini-series based on the novel with the same title by Choi Jung-joo, starring Jang Dong-gun and Yum Jung-ah. It aired on MBC from August 9 to August 31, 1993, for 8 episodes.[^43] While Lee Joon-gi's later Iljimae portrays him as a charming, gregarious swashbuckling hero, Jang Dong-gun's 1993 version sticks to a more traditional approach by portraying its titular character as a reclusive loner who struggles between good and evil.[^44]

**2008 SBS Series:**
From April to July 2008, Lee Joon-gi played the titular role in SBS's "Iljimae," a period-action drama based on Chinese folklore from the Ming dynasty about a masked Robin Hood-esque character during the Joseon era.[^45] The series was an original story based on the Korean folk hero and gentleman thief "Iljimae" from the Joseon era, set around 1633.[^46] Due to adaptation rights for Ko Woo-young's comic being owned by MBC, SBS opted to create an original story for the character instead.[^47]

The drama achieved exceptional success with a final episode viewership rating of 31.4%, placing it among the top-rated Korean historical dramas.[^48] At the 2008 SBS Drama Awards, it won multiple honors including Top Excellence Award - Actor (Lee Joon-gi), Excellence Award for Supporting Actor (Lee Moon-shik), New Star Award (Han Hyo-joo), Netizen Popularity Award (Lee Joon-gi), and Best Young Actor/Actress Awards.[^49]

Director Kim Jin-min opined some years later that Iljimae was a turning point for Lee Joon-gi as the role enabled him to shed his "pretty boy" image and also highlight his martial arts background.[^50] Lee Joon-gi has a fourth dan taekwondo black belt, a first dan hapkido black belt, and a first dan taekkyeon black belt, and due to his proficiency in martial arts, he rarely uses a stunt double for fight scenes.[^51][^52]

**2009 MBC Series - "The Return of Iljimae":**
"The Return of Iljimae" is a 2009 South Korean historical action television series starring Jung Il-woo in the title role of Iljimae, along with Yoon Jin-seo, Kim Min-jong, and Jung Hye-young. It aired on MBC from January 21 to April 9, 2009, for 24 episodes.[^53] Jung Il-woo became the third Korean actor to play the hero in live-action media following Jang Dong-gun (MBC, 1993) and Lee Joon-gi (SBS, 2008).[^54]

Critics noted significant differences between the two contemporary versions. While Iljimae (2008) was comical, light, and entertaining in many scenes, "The Return of Iljimae" was poignant, beautiful, and well-portrayed with a tone so much more mature that the former seemed almost childish in comparison.[^55] Jung Il-woo's character emotionally captivates the viewer and brings the drama to another level altogether—his acting isn't over-the-top like Lee Joon-gi's Iljimae, but he is able to reveal emotions simply with his gaze, a kind of acting that is certainly rare and extraordinary.[^56] "The Return of Iljimae" is most remarkable for its evocation of mood—a fantasia in a minor key that weaves a bittersweet, melancholy spell, accented not so much by its characters' tragedies as by their loneliness.[^57]

## Comparison with Other Korean Folk Heroes

Iljimae exists within a broader tradition of Korean folk heroes who challenge social inequality and corruption. The most notable comparison is with Hong Gildong, Korea's most celebrated folk hero who bridges the gap between Robin Hood and a social revolutionary.[^58]

Hong Gildong is the illegitimate son of a nobleman and his lowborn concubine who, gifted with supreme intelligence and supernatural abilities, steals from rich and corrupt aristocrats.[^59] "Hong Gildong jeon" is a Korean novel written during the Joseon period and is considered an iconic piece of Korean literature and culture, arguably the single most important work of classic (i.e., premodern) prose fiction from Korea.[^60][^61]

Both Iljimae and Hong Gildong are phantom thief/Robin Hood-esque figures who steal from the wealthy to help the poor, representing struggles against social inequality. However, in dramatic adaptations, Iljimae was generally more serious in tone while Hong Gildong was more lighthearted and even slice-of-life in tone.[^62] The key difference is that Hong Gildong has much deeper roots in Korean classical literature and cultural identity, originating from Joseon-era written works, while Iljimae is a more modern creation from Chinese folklore adapted through comic books and later television dramas.[^63]

Historical sources point to the existence of a bandit named Hong Gildong who was arrested in 1500, but the historical inspiration for the character was the Korean bandit and folk hero Im Kkeokjeong, who lived in the early 16th century.[^64] From 1559 to 1562, Im Kkeokjeong led a growing group of bandits called the Noklimdang who would take from the rich and distribute booty to the poor, with his group growing from just a few dozen to eventually a few hundred fighters.[^65]

Heroes like Hong Gildong and Iljimae represent the dreams of those trapped in lower social positions, offering fantasy fulfillment while subtly critiquing the unfairness of hereditary privilege.[^66] The recurring theme of social mobility in Korean hero stories reflects the rigid class system of the Joseon Dynasty.[^67]

These folk hero narratives can be analyzed through Eric Hobsbawm's theory of social banditry. Hobsbawm, a Marxist historian, introduced the term "social bandit" in his books "Primitive Rebels" (1959) and "Bandits" (1969), characterizing social banditry as a primitive form of class struggle and resistance in pre-industrial and frontier societies.[^68][^69] Hobsbawm's ideal type of the social bandit is based on the archetype of the Robin Hood myth, in which the bandit is idealized as a hero and social actor who robs the ruling class of its wealth to share captured spoils among his community and the society's needy and oppressed.[^70]

Scholarly work on Hong Gildong references Hobsbawm's framework on "the universal figure of the heroic outlaw," indicating that this theoretical lens has been applied to Korean bandit legends.[^71] The legend reflects the frustrations of common people who faced insurmountable barriers due to their birth status, aligning with Hobsbawm's theory that social bandits emerge from class tensions in agrarian societies.[^72]

However, the application of Hobsbawm's theory has faced criticism. Anthropologist Anton Blok noted in his 1972 article "The Peasant and Brigand: Social Banditry Reconsidered" that the poems and ballads Hobsbawm used more often reflected ideals and aspirations than social reality.[^73]

## Social Justice Themes and Modern Resonance

The enduring popularity of Iljimae reflects deeper currents in Korean society's engagement with questions of justice, inequality, and resistance to corruption. Korean historical dramas (sageuk) often mirror current Korean society and global issues, with universal themes of class, power, family, justice, and love creating empathy that draws in international audiences.[^74] Dramas based on legendary Robin Hood figures like Hong Gildong and Iljimae explicitly challenge ideas of justice, class, and revolution.[^75]

An emerging trend among Korean dramas is showcasing ongoing societal issues including gender inequality, suicide, classism, bullying, corruption, and racism.[^76] K-drama writers explore profound themes like class inequality, trauma, and justice within an accessible and entertaining package.[^77] K-dramas deliver narratives about contemporary social unease and unrest caused by democratic systems proving unable to guarantee social equity.[^78]

Historical dramas often recast the past to reflect present social values, and tracing those reconfigurations is essential for understanding cultural historiography.[^79] Korean dramas incorporate the concept of "han"—a complex feeling of unresolved resentment, grief, and sadness born from historical collective suffering that often forms the emotional backstory of characters.[^80] This cultural dimension adds depth to narratives exploring historical injustices with contemporary relevance.

Korean folk heroes embody collective aspirations of people who often found themselves under oppressive rule, challenging authority and fighting injustice as symbols of hope for the downtrodden.[^81] Korean legends function as sophisticated social commentary, addressing issues that were often too dangerous to discuss openly, providing a safe space for critiquing power structures during periods of authoritarian rule.[^82]

Supernatural powers in Korean folklore symbolize the extraordinary strength needed to overcome systemic injustice, as only magical abilities could level the playing field in a society with rigid hierarchies and limited social mobility.[^83] While Iljimae lacks the supernatural powers of Hong Gildong, his extraordinary martial arts skills and cunning intelligence serve similar narrative functions—elevating him beyond ordinary capability to challenge entrenched power structures.

## Role in the Korean Wave (Hallyu)

Iljimae adaptations, particularly the 2008 and 2009 television series, played a role in the broader phenomenon of the Korean Wave (Hallyu), which refers to the rapid global rise in South Korean popular culture since the 1990s.[^84] Chinese journalists coined the term "Korean Wave" in 1999 to describe the growing popularity of South Korean cultural products.[^85]

Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the end of military censorship over the South Korean entertainment industry, the country emerged as a major exporter of popular culture.[^86] In 1993, the government shifted to a policy of cultural commercialization, incorporating cultural products as economic exports.[^87] Beginning in the late 1990s with the increasing popularity of Korean TV dramas and cinema across Asia, hallyu gained worldwide momentum in the mid-2000s through the remarkable success of the Korean music industry.[^88]

Historical dramas played a crucial role in the Korean Wave's expansion. "Dae Jang Geum," an epic TV series about royal cuisine which aired between 2003 and 2004, was exported to 91 countries around the world including Japan, China, and Turkey, expanding the scope of the Korean Wave into Korean food, fashion, and medicine while drawing global interest in Korean culture.[^89] "Winter Sonata" in 2002 was one of the most notable Korean TV series to achieve early and significant success.[^90]

The Korean Wave has been recognized as a form of soft power and a significant economic asset for South Korea, generating revenue through cultural exports and tourism.[^91] Hallyu-related sectors such as cosmetics, fashion, tourism, and education have seen substantial economic contributions, with cultural exports contributing to a 0.2% increase in South Korea's GDP in 2004, escalating remarkably to $12.3 billion by 2019.[^92] As of 2020, the total number of members who have joined Hallyu-related organizations in all countries around the world reached nearly 100 million, a five-fold increase over five years.[^93]

The 2008 Iljimae drama's efforts included Korean-to-local-language dubs and subtitles, facilitating adaptation in diverse markets and underscoring the drama's role in the Hallyu wave's cultural exports.[^94]

## Criticisms and Limitations

While Iljimae has achieved iconic status in Korean popular culture, the character and its adaptations have faced some criticisms and limitations worthy of examination.

### Historical Accuracy Concerns

The drama is not historically accurate in the traditional sense. Iljimae is a legendary folk hero rather than an actual historical figure, originating as a fictional character from Chinese Ming Dynasty novels.[^95] The 2008 and 2009 dramas take creative liberties with an already fictional character, creating original storylines set in the Joseon period for entertainment purposes rather than documenting historical events.[^96]

### Narrative and Character Development Issues

Some viewers and critics found fault with specific aspects of the 2008 adaptation. Common criticisms included that the character Eun Chae lacked development, depth, and heart, was unnecessary, and her romance with Iljimae was highly unconvincing.[^97] Critics noted they either should have taken the romance out or put more effort into it.[^98]

The ending of the 2008 series was criticized for not providing more closure and for building dramatic irony that begged for release the audience never got.[^99] The 2008 version was described by some as "comical, light, and poorly acted albeit entertaining in many scenes," in contrast to the more mature 2009 "Return of Iljimae."[^100]

### Cultural Appropriation Questions

The character's origins in Chinese Ming Dynasty folklore raise questions about cultural ownership and adaptation. While the cross-cultural exchange between China and Korea during the Joseon period was historically documented and mutual, some might argue that Korea's claim to Iljimae as a distinctly Korean folk hero represents a form of cultural appropriation from Chinese sources.

However, this critique must be balanced against the reality of East Asian cultural exchange and the process by which imported stories become naturalized within receiving cultures. The character has been so thoroughly adapted and reimagined within Korean cultural contexts—particularly through Ko Woo-young's influential manhwa and subsequent adaptations—that it has arguably become as much a Korean cultural property as a Chinese one.

### Romanticization of Criminality

A fundamental critique that can be leveled against Iljimae and similar Robin Hood narratives is that they romanticize criminal behavior and vigilante justice. By celebrating a character who operates outside legal frameworks, such stories could be seen as undermining respect for law and encouraging extralegal solutions to social problems.

This concern is particularly relevant given the harsh punishments that actual thieves faced during the Joseon Dynasty—including tattooing, torture, and even strangulation for repeat offenses.[^101][^102] The celebration of Iljimae as a folk hero stands in stark contrast to the brutal treatment of real criminals, raising questions about which forms of lawbreaking society chooses to celebrate and which it chooses to punish.

### Limited Scope of Social Change

While Iljimae challenges corrupt individuals within the system, the character's approach does not fundamentally challenge or transform the system itself. Redistributing wealth from corrupt officials to the poor provides temporary relief but does not address the structural inequalities that produce poverty and enable corruption in the first place.

This limitation is characteristic of what Hobsbawm identified as "primitive" forms of resistance—social banditry may express dissatisfaction with the existing order but typically does not articulate or pursue a comprehensive alternative social vision. From this perspective, celebrating Iljimae might actually serve conservative functions by channeling revolutionary energy into individualistic heroism rather than collective political organizing.

---

## Academic and Scholarly Assessment

### Positive Scholarly Views

Scholars of Korean literature and culture have recognized Iljimae's significance as a window into Korean social values and historical consciousness. The character serves as an important case study in how folklore and popular culture narratives evolve across national and temporal boundaries.

The adaptation of Chinese source material into distinctly Korean cultural forms demonstrates the creative agency of Korean writers and artists in shaping imported narratives to reflect local concerns, values, and aesthetics. Ko Woo-young's manhwa adaptation, in particular, has been recognized for its contribution to developing a distinctly Korean comic aesthetic and for its sophisticated use of historical settings as commentary on contemporary political issues during South Korea's authoritarian period.[^103]

The character's enduring appeal across multiple generations and media formats indicates its resonance with fundamental aspects of Korean cultural identity—particularly the tension between social hierarchy and egalitarian aspirations, and between legal authority and moral justice. Scholars have noted that Korean legends typically emphasize moral virtue and social justice over individual achievement, with heroes succeeding through wisdom, righteousness, and community support rather than personal glory.[^104]

The Iljimae narrative's focus on challenging corrupt authority figures while leaving underlying hierarchical structures intact reflects the complexity of Joseon-era social thought, which valued order and hierarchy while also maintaining robust traditions of remonstrance against unjust rulers. Korean folklore's emphasis on moral justice over legal justice reflects skepticism about formal institutions, with heroes typically bypassing official channels to achieve justice.[^105]

### Critical Scholarly Perspectives

From more critical scholarly perspectives, the Iljimae phenomenon can be seen as revealing the limitations of popular culture narratives in addressing systemic social problems. The focus on individual heroism and moral exceptionalism deflects attention from the need for structural transformation and collective political action.

The character's origins in imported Chinese folklore rather than indigenous Korean sources also complicates narratives of Korean cultural distinctiveness. While the adaptation process involved significant Koreanization, the fundamental narrative structure and character archetype remain derived from external sources, raising questions about what constitutes authentically Korean folklore versus adapted foreign material.

The romanticization of the Joseon period in historical dramas like Iljimae can be seen as a form of cultural nostalgia that glosses over the harsh realities of premodern life and the genuine oppression experienced by the vast majority of people under the yangban-dominated social system. By presenting an aestheticized, sanitized version of Joseon society, such dramas may contribute to historical amnesia about the real conditions that made figures like Iljimae appealing in the first place.

Some scholars have applied Anton Blok's critique of Hobsbawm's social banditry theory to Korean Robin Hood figures, noting that the poems and ballads celebrating such figures more often reflected ideals and aspirations than social reality.[^106] The actual bandits and thieves of the Joseon period were more likely to be desperate criminals preying on vulnerable peasants than noble heroes challenging corrupt elites.

---

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

Despite these criticisms, Iljimae's legacy in Korean popular culture remains robust and continues to evolve. The character represents an important touchstone in Korea's ongoing cultural conversation about justice, authority, and resistance to corruption.

The continued production of Iljimae adaptations across different media and decades demonstrates the narrative's adaptability and enduring relevance. Each generation of creators has reimagined the character to speak to contemporary concerns while maintaining core elements of the legend—the plum blossom signature, the Robin Hood-style redistribution of wealth, the critique of corrupt authority, and the tension between personal identity and social role.

The character's influence extends beyond direct adaptations to inform broader trends in Korean popular culture. The vigilante justice theme explored in Iljimae narratives has found new expression in contemporary Korean dramas like "Vigilante" (2023), which explores similar questions about justice systems and moral authority in a modern setting.[^107][^108] These contemporary works demonstrate that the fundamental tensions Iljimae embodies—between legal justice and moral justice, between individual action and systemic change, between acceptance of hierarchy and resistance to oppression—remain central to Korean cultural discourse.

The global success of Korean historical dramas featuring themes of social justice and class inequality has helped introduce international audiences to Korean cultural values and historical contexts. Iljimae, along with other Korean Robin Hood figures like Hong Gildong, has become part of the vocabulary through which non-Korean audiences understand Korean approaches to questions of justice and resistance.
