## Summary

The 228 Incident (二二八事件 / Èr'èrbā Shìjiàn), also known as the February 28 Massacre, was an island-wide anti-government uprising in Taiwan that began on February 28, 1947, and was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang (KMT / 國民黨)-led Republic of China government. The incident marked one of the bloodiest episodes in Taiwan's modern history and profoundly shaped the island's political identity, ethnic relations, and ultimately its path toward democracy.[^1]

The uprising was triggered on February 27, 1947, when agents of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau beat a widow selling untaxed cigarettes and shot a bystander who protested their brutality. The next day, crowds demanding justice were fired upon, igniting protests across the island. What began as demonstrations against government corruption quickly escalated into an islandwide rebellion against the KMT's authoritarian misrule.[^2]

Governor Chen Yi (陳儀) declared martial law and summoned military reinforcements from mainland China. The arriving troops conducted systematic killings targeting Taiwanese elites—intellectuals, students, lawyers, doctors, and local leaders—decimating a generation of potential opposition. Estimates of the dead range from 18,000 to 28,000, though the true toll may never be known.[^3]

The massacre was followed by 38 years of martial law and the "White Terror" (白色恐怖), during which the incident was a forbidden topic. Only with democratization in the late 1980s and 1990s did Taiwan begin to confront this traumatic history. February 28 is now a national holiday—Peace Memorial Day (和平紀念日)—and the 228 Incident has become central to Taiwan's distinct national identity and its complex relationship with China.[^4]

## Historical Background

### Japanese Colonial Rule (1895-1945)

Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the Qing Dynasty following China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1895). For fifty years, Taiwan developed under Japanese colonial rule, which, despite its exploitative nature, brought significant modernization:[^5]

- Modern infrastructure (railways, roads, ports, electricity)
- Universal public education and high literacy rates
- Legal systems with established rule of law
- Agricultural and industrial development
- Public health improvements

By 1945, Taiwan was one of the most developed regions in Asia outside Japan. Many Taiwanese had received Japanese education, spoke Japanese fluently, and had absorbed elements of Japanese culture—factors that would create cultural friction with incoming mainland Chinese authorities.[^6]

### The "Retrocession" and Initial Hope (1945)

When Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China, led by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government. Many Taiwanese initially welcomed what they called "guangfu" (光復 / glorious restoration to the motherland), hoping for liberation from colonial rule and genuine participation in governing their homeland.[^7]

### The Reality of KMT Administration

The hopes of Taiwanese were quickly dashed by the reality of KMT administration under Governor Chen Yi. Key grievances included:

**Political Exclusion:** Despite their education and administrative experience, Taiwanese (本省人 / benshengren—"people of this province") were systematically excluded from meaningful political positions. The government was staffed almost entirely by mainlanders (外省人 / waishengren—"people from outside provinces") who often looked down on Taiwanese culture and treated the island as conquered territory.[^8]

**Economic Exploitation:** The KMT government seized Japanese properties and established monopolies on key industries, channeling profits to the mainland and to corrupt officials. Goods were shipped to China while Taiwanese faced shortages. Unemployment soared as Japanese-era employees were replaced by mainlanders.[^9]

**Corruption and Lawlessness:** KMT officials and soldiers engaged in widespread looting, extortion, and violence. The contrast with the relative order of the Japanese colonial period was stark. Taiwanese often said that "dogs (Japanese) left, and pigs (mainlanders) came"—dogs may bark but at least guard the house, while pigs only eat.[^10]

**Cultural Tensions:** The incoming mainlanders often dismissed Taiwanese language and culture as "Japanized" and inferior. The ban on Japanese language—which many Taiwanese spoke better than Mandarin—further alienated the population.[^11]

## The Uprising

### The Trigger: February 27, 1947

On the evening of February 27, 1947, agents from the Taiwan Monopoly Bureau were conducting an anti-contraband patrol in Taipei's Tianma Tea House area. They encountered Lin Jiang-mai (林江邁), a 40-year-old widow selling untaxed cigarettes to support herself and her family.[^12]

The agents confiscated her cigarettes and money. When she pleaded to keep her earnings, an agent struck her on the head with his pistol, leaving her bleeding on the ground. An angry crowd gathered. When they pursued the fleeing agents, one agent, panicking, fired into the crowd, killing bystander Chen Wen-xi (陳文溪).[^13]

### February 28: The Explosion

The next morning, protesters gathered and marched to the Monopoly Bureau and then to the Governor's office demanding justice. Governor Chen Yi's guards opened fire from the roof on the unarmed crowd, killing several more people.[^14]

This massacre transformed localized anger into island-wide rebellion. Within hours:

- Protesters seized the Taiwan Broadcasting Corporation radio station and broadcast news of the massacre
- Citizens rose up across the island—in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taichung, Chiayi, and elsewhere
- Taiwanese formed self-defense militia groups
- Attacks on mainlander-owned businesses and KMT offices spread[^15]

### The Settlement Committee and False Hope (March 1-7)

In the days following February 28, local Taiwanese elites formed the "228 Incident Settlement Committee" (二二八事件處理委員會) to negotiate with Governor Chen Yi. The committee submitted demands including:[^16]

- Political reform and Taiwanese participation in government
- End to economic monopolies
- Release of political prisoners
- Punishment of those responsible for the killings
- Democratic elections

Chen Yi appeared to negotiate in good faith, agreeing to many demands while secretly requesting military reinforcements from Chiang Kai-shek on the mainland. He used the negotiation period to identify and compile lists of Taiwanese leaders and activists.[^17]

### The Crackdown (March 8 onwards)

On March 8, 1947, the 21st Division of the Chinese Nationalist Army landed at Keelung harbor. What followed was systematic terror:

**Indiscriminate Killing:** Troops opened fire on crowds at the harbor and killed bystanders throughout the city. Machine guns were set up at major intersections.[^18]

**Targeted Assassination:** Using lists compiled during the "negotiations," soldiers systematically hunted down Taiwanese elites. Students, lawyers, doctors, businessmen, local politicians, and intellectuals were arrested, tortured, and executed—often publicly to terrorize the population.[^19]

**Island-wide Suppression:** The pattern repeated across Taiwan. In Chiayi, Kaohsiung, and other cities, military forces conducted similar operations. Some victims were bound with wire, shot, and dumped in rivers or the sea.[^20]

The most intense violence lasted about two weeks, but sporadic killings and arrests continued for months. By the time the situation "stabilized," a generation of Taiwanese leadership had been decimated.[^21]

## Death Toll

The exact number killed in the 228 Incident remains unknown due to government suppression of records and mass disposal of bodies:

**Initial Government Claims:**

- Chen Yi's administration claimed 3,000-4,000 deaths[^22]

**Later Estimates:**

- 1992 Executive Yuan report: approximately 18,000-28,000 deaths
- Some scholars estimate up to 30,000
- The 228 Memorial Foundation has documented over 800 confirmed cases, with many more believed undocumented[^23]

**Why Uncertainty Persists:**

- Bodies were dumped at sea, in rivers, or in mass graves
- Records were destroyed during the White Terror
- Families kept silent for decades out of fear
- Many victims simply "disappeared"[^24]

---

## Aftermath: The White Terror (1949-1987)

The 228 Incident marked the beginning of Taiwan's "White Terror" period, characterized by:

**Martial Law:** Declared in May 1949 and not lifted until 1987—one of the longest martial law periods in modern history.[^25]

**Political Suppression:** Suspected dissidents faced imprisonment, torture, and execution. An estimated 140,000 people were imprisoned for political reasons; at least 3,000-4,000 were executed.[^26]

**Taboo History:** For nearly four decades, the 228 Incident could not be publicly discussed, researched, or commemorated. Parents did not tell their children; survivors suffered in enforced silence.[^27]

**KMT Monopoly on Power:** The mainlander-dominated KMT ruled Taiwan as a one-party state, with the Taiwanese majority systematically excluded from political power until democratization in the late 1980s.[^28]

---

## Controversies and Debates

### Nature of the Violence

The 228 Incident remains contested in its characterization:

**As State Terror:** Most historians view the crackdown as systematic state violence targeting civilian populations, with elements of ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating Taiwanese elites.[^29]

**As Suppression of Rebellion:** Some (particularly in the KMT historical narrative) characterized it as a legitimate response to violent insurrection, though this view has largely been discredited.[^30]

**As Colonial Transition Violence:** Scholars increasingly analyze it within the broader pattern of post-WWII colonial transitions and the violence that often accompanied them.[^31]

### Benshengren-Waishengren Relations

The incident created lasting ethnic tension in Taiwan between:

- **Benshengren (本省人):** Taiwanese who had lived under Japanese rule, primarily Hoklo and Hakka peoples
- **Waishengren (外省人):** Mainlanders who fled to Taiwan with the KMT after 1945-1949

While this division has diminished over generations, the 228 Incident remains a touchstone for understanding Taiwanese identity distinct from Chinese identity.[^32]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views (Democratic Taiwan Perspective)

**Foundation of Taiwanese Identity:** The shared trauma of 228 and the White Terror forged a distinct Taiwanese consciousness. The demand for democracy and self-determination that emerged from this experience ultimately led to Taiwan's successful democratization.[^33]

**Symbol of Resistance:** The bravery of those who stood up against authoritarian misrule—and the sacrifice of those who died—represents an important democratic heritage that contemporary Taiwan honors.[^34]

**Model for Transitional Justice:** Taiwan's gradual process of confronting 228—through official apologies, compensation, memorialization, and historical research—offers lessons for other societies dealing with historical atrocities.[^35]

### Negative/Alternative Views (Historical KMT Position)

**Restoration of Order:** The traditional KMT narrative characterized the uprising as communist-influenced chaos requiring military intervention to prevent Taiwan from falling into anarchy or enemy hands.[^36]

**Excesses Not Policy:** Some argued that while violence occurred, it represented the excesses of individual soldiers rather than systematic policy—a claim contradicted by documentation of targeted killing lists.[^37]

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Democratization and Justice

- **1995:** President Lee Teng-hui (himself Taiwanese) issued the first government apology for 228
- **1997:** February 28 established as Peace Memorial Day national holiday
- **2007:** 228 Memorial Museums opened in Taipei and other cities
- **Compensation:** Government established fund to compensate victims' families[^38]

### Political Impact

The 228 Incident became central to:

- **Taiwan Independence Movement:** The massacre convinced many Taiwanese that their interests were incompatible with mainland Chinese rule
- **Democratic Progressive Party (DPP):** The opposition party that emerged during democratization made 228 commemorations central to its political identity
- **Cross-Strait Relations:** Different interpretations of 228 remain a point of contention between Taiwan and the PRC[^39]

### International Recognition

UNESCO has not formally inscribed 228-related documents on Memory of the World Register, but international scholars recognize the incident as a significant case study in:

- State violence and mass atrocity
- Post-colonial transition violence
- Transitional justice processes
- Formation of national identity[^40]
