## Summary

Juan Maldacena proposed the AdS/CFT correspondence (Maldacena conjecture) in 1997, establishing a deep connection between string theory in anti-de Sitter space and quantum field theory on its boundary. This holographic principle became one of the most influential ideas in theoretical physics, with over 20,000 citations. It suggests spacetime itself may emerge from quantum entanglement.
