## Summary

Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.[^1] He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism and legal reform throughout the nineteenth century.[^2] Bentham defined the "fundamental axiom" of his philosophy as the principle that "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong."[^3] His writings ranged across ethics, law, political economy, prison reform, international law, and democratic theory, making major contributions that continue to feature in contemporary philosophical and legal discussions.[^4] Though many of his ambitious projects remained unrealized during his lifetime, including his famous Panopticon prison design, his intellectual legacy profoundly shaped modern conceptions of law, governance, and social policy.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Jeremy Bentham was born on February 15, 1748 (February 4, 1747/8 O.S., February 15, 1748 N.S.) in Houndsditch, London, to Jeremiah Bentham, a prosperous attorney, and Alicia Woodward.[^6][^7] His family were wealthy supporters of the Tory party, providing young Jeremy with a comfortable upbringing that would enable his future intellectual pursuits.[^8] Bentham was a remarkable child prodigy who demonstrated extraordinary intellectual abilities from an exceptionally early age.[^9] He was reportedly found as a toddler sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and began studying Latin at the tender age of three.[^10]

His formal education began at Westminster School, which he attended from 1755 to 1760.[^11] At the age of twelve, Bentham was sent to Queen's College, Oxford, his father having decided that Jeremy would follow him into the legal profession.[^12] He completed his Bachelor's degree in 1763 at only fifteen years of age, finishing his Master's degree in 1766.[^13] In 1769, Bentham was called to the bar, though he would never practice law.[^14]

However, Bentham soon became profoundly disillusioned with the law as it was practiced and taught in eighteenth-century England.[^15] He was particularly disturbed after hearing the lectures of Sir William Blackstone, the celebrated legal scholar whose commentaries represented the orthodox view of English common law.[^16] Instead of practicing law, Bentham made the momentous decision to write about it, dedicating his life to legal and social reform based on philosophical principles.[^17] According to Bentham himself, it was in 1769 that he came upon "the principle of utility," inspired by the writings of David Hume, Joseph Priestley, Claude Adrien Helvétius, and Cesare Beccaria.[^18] This discovery would become the foundation of his entire philosophical system and his life's work.

The death of his mother, Alicia Whitehorn, on January 6, 1759, when Bentham was only eleven years old, marked a significant personal loss during his formative years.[^19] Despite this early tragedy, Bentham's intellectual development continued unabated, and he would go on to become one of the most prolific and influential thinkers of his age, reportedly spending eight to twelve hours writing every day throughout his long life.[^20]

## Rise to Prominence

Bentham's rise to intellectual prominence began with the anonymous publication of "A Fragment on Government" in 1776.[^21] This was Bentham's first major publication, and it concentrated on a passage of five or six pages in which William Blackstone discussed the origin of society and government.[^22] The work offered three main criticisms of Blackstone's conservative legal philosophy and attracted significant attention in legal and philosophical circles, though its authorship remained unknown for some time.[^23]

The work that would establish Bentham's reputation more permanently was "An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation," first published in 1789.[^24] This classic text in modern philosophy and jurisprudence contained the important statement of the foundations of utilitarian philosophy and a pioneering study of crime and punishment.[^25] In the famous opening passage, Bentham wrote: "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do."[^26] This work laid out his systematic approach to ethics and legislation, arguing that the rightness of actions should be determined by their consequences for human happiness.

Between 1786 and 1787, Bentham traveled to Krichev in Belarus to visit his brother Samuel, who was working there as an engineer.[^27] It was during this visit that Bentham conceived his most famous architectural project: the Panopticon, a revolutionary prison design.[^28] The word "panopticon" derives from the Greek for "all seeing" (panoptes), and the design envisioned a circular "Inspection House" with prisoners' cells around the outer wall and a central inspection tower from which guards could observe cells at any time.[^29] Though the Panopticon would never be built as Bentham envisaged it, the concept would prove enormously influential in penology and social theory.[^30]

The period from 1790 to 1800 was one of Bentham's most fruitful, during which he composed many of his best-known works.[^31] In 1792, he was made a French citizen in recognition of his contributions to political philosophy and his sympathy with reform movements.[^32] After 1808, James Mill became his disciple and helped propagate Bentham's doctrines more widely.[^33] Mill, along with other followers, would form the core of what became known as the "Philosophical Radicals," a group of politically minded reformers inspired by Bentham's utilitarian principles.[^34]

In December 1823, Bentham provided funds to start "The Westminster Review," co-founding it with James Mill as a journal for the Philosophical Radicals.[^35] This periodical served as a counterpoise to the more conservative journals of the time and became an important vehicle for radical views on political and social reform.[^36] By this time, Bentham had become the intellectual leader of a movement that sought to reduce aristocratic power, privilege, and abuse, and to remake British institutions according to utilitarian principles.[^37]

## Major Achievements

Jeremy Bentham's achievements span philosophy, jurisprudence, social reform, and political theory, making him one of the most influential thinkers of the modern era. His development of utilitarianism as a systematic moral and political philosophy stands as his most enduring intellectual contribution.[^38] The principle of utility, which states that any action is right insofar as it increases happiness and wrong insofar as it increases pain, provided a revolutionary framework for evaluating laws, policies, and institutions.[^39] For Bentham, happiness simply meant pleasure and the absence of pain, which could be quantified according to its intensity and duration using his "felicific calculus" or "hedonic calculus."[^40]

Bentham's work on legal codification represented another major achievement. By 1811, he had worked out comprehensive preparations for a penal code, a plan of judicial procedure, a plan of judicial establishment, a code on evidence, and a constitutional code.[^41] His vision was for the "Pannomion" to serve as a complete code of laws, covering all areas—civil, penal, and constitutional.[^42] Though never adopted in its entirety, this work remains a landmark in legal theory, offering a blueprint for comprehensive, utility-driven legislation.[^43] His "Codification Proposal, Addressed to all Nations Professing Liberal Opinions" (1822) advertised his credentials as a codifier of law to politicians and statesmen around the world.[^44]

In the realm of democratic reform, Bentham made groundbreaking contributions that were far ahead of his time. His "Catechism of Parliamentary Reform" (published in 1817) advocated annual elections, equal electoral districts, a wide suffrage including women's suffrage, and the secret ballot.[^45] Bentham's advocacy for the secret ballot was particularly influential; he argued that "public interest is better promoted by keeping the votes secret than by rendering them public," believing that secrecy enabled voters to vote according to their own interests rather than being influenced by external pressures.[^46] His comprehensive set of reforms included the elimination of royal patronage, a substantial extension of the franchise, and the accurate and regular publication of parliamentary debates.[^47]

Bentham was a pioneering advocate for animal rights, arguing that the ability to suffer, not the ability to reason, should be the benchmark for moral consideration.[^48] In a famous passage, he wrote that if reason alone were the criterion by which we judge who ought to have rights, human infants and adults with certain forms of disability might fall short too.[^49] This argument laid important groundwork for modern animal welfare philosophy.

His advocacy for women's rights was equally remarkable for his era. Bentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose in 1759, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist.[^50] He spoke for complete equality between the sexes, arguing in favor of women's suffrage, a woman's right to obtain a divorce, and a woman's right to hold political office.[^51] In his 1809 work "A Catechism of Parliamentary Reform," he advocated for the freedom for women to participate in government.[^52]

In international law, Bentham wrote "A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace" (1786-1789) as part of his work on the Principles of International Law.[^53] His plan proposed the reduction of military forces in Europe and the emancipation of colonies, including giving up colonies, establishing free trade, and the mutual reduction of the size of armies.[^54] He suggested establishing a common court of judicature for the decision of differences between nations and emphasized that secrecy in foreign affairs ought not to be endured.[^55]

Bentham called for numerous progressive reforms including the abolition of slavery, the abolition of capital punishment, and the abolition of physical punishment, including that of children.[^56] He advocated individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, and freedom of expression.[^57] His influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself was considerable.[^58] Both the Reform Bill of 1832 and later reforms in the century reflected Benthamite concerns.[^59]

Bentham's work is considered an early precursor of modern welfare economics.[^60] His analysis of diminishing marginal utility—the idea that additional units of a good provide progressively less satisfaction—anticipated key concepts in economic theory.[^61] The Law and Economics movement owes a great debt to Bentham, with many scholars considering his work the genesis of the movement.[^62] His pleasure-pain calculus was akin to cost-benefit analysis, and he proposed using money and wealth to calculate pleasures and pains, allowing economic analysis to measure desirability in non-economic legal fields.[^63]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his many contributions, Jeremy Bentham's philosophy and proposals have faced substantial criticisms from both his contemporaries and modern scholars. The most fundamental criticism concerns his utilitarian calculus itself. The felicific calculus can be difficult to apply in practice, as measuring and comparing different types of pleasures and pains is inherently subjective and complex, making it challenging to arrive at definitive conclusions about the best course of action.[^64]

Critics argue that Bentham's utilitarianism can lead to what is known as the "tyranny of the majority."[^65] If an action that harms a minority results in greater happiness for the majority, Bentham's utilitarianism might justify that action, even though it seems unjust or unethical.[^66] Bentham dismissed the idea of "natural rights" as "nonsensical," famously calling natural rights "nonsense upon stilts," but this means utilitarianism seems open to cases where the majority are morally required to exploit the minority for the greater good of maximizing total pleasure.[^67] This critique raises serious concerns about individual rights and the potential oppression of minorities or vulnerable groups under a purely utilitarian framework.[^68]

Another significant criticism is that Bentham's utilitarianism has a narrow conception of happiness based solely on pleasure and pain, ignoring other important values such as justice, dignity, and freedom.[^69] His contemporary critics argued that Bentham's philosophy was "worthy of only swine" because he made no distinction between different qualities of pleasure.[^70] This criticism would later be addressed by John Stuart Mill, who introduced qualitative distinctions between higher and lower pleasures, arguing that intellectual and moral pleasures are superior to mere physical satisfaction.[^71]

The "demandingness objection" poses another challenge to Bentham's system.[^72] Being a maximizing ethical theory, utilitarianism requires that pleasure be actually maximized at all opportunities, setting an extremely high standard for acting morally.[^73] Additionally, Bentham's requirement for "agent-neutrality"—that one must look at situations as any neutral observer would and not give special preference to anyone irrespective of emotional attachments—seems to conflict with common moral intuitions about special obligations to family and friends.[^74]

Karl Marx criticized Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognize that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts, viewing it as a philosophy that universalized the values and preferences of the English bourgeoisie.[^75] Michel Foucault's influential critique of the Panopticon in "Discipline and Punish" regarded it as the representation of the disciplinary power of the modern state and a symbol of authoritarian surveillance.[^76] Foucault argued that the panopticon metaphor was present in modern society—in auditorium classrooms, city grid designs, and hospital floor plans—creating what he called a "carceral culture."[^77]

The Panopticon project itself became a source of controversy and personal disappointment for Bentham. Despite years of effort and considerable personal expense, the British government never built the prison as Bentham envisaged it.[^78] The failure of this project consumed much of Bentham's energy and finances, though he was eventually awarded £23,000 in compensation for his expenses in 1813.[^79] One lasting legacy of the failed prison plan is that Tate Britain, the art gallery, now stands on the River Thames site that Bentham had purchased for his prison.[^80]

Some scholars have criticized Bentham's thought for its authoritarian aspects. In educational research, Bentham's ideas are sometimes regarded negatively because of their potential for authoritarian application, an assessment supposedly promoted by Foucault's interpretation.[^81] However, Bentham scholars like Janet Semple have tried to rescue Bentham from such evaluations by pointing out that "Foucault appears to have paid little attention to Bentham's mature theory of government."[^82]

## Personal Life

Jeremy Bentham never married, remaining a bachelor throughout his eighty-four years.[^83] While he had several infatuations with women during his life and wrote extensively on sex and marriage from a utilitarian perspective, he never entered into matrimony himself.[^84] His scholarly work "On Love and Marriage" proposed utilitarian approaches to relationships, including the controversial idea of short-term marriage contracts.[^85]

Bentham developed several important and lasting friendships that shaped both his personal life and intellectual legacy. He became devoted to John Bowring, describing their relationship as one of "son and father."[^86] Bentham appointed Bowring as political editor of "The Westminster Review" and eventually as his literary executor, entrusting him with the massive task of organizing and publishing his voluminous unpublished works.[^87]

Edwin Chadwick, who wrote extensively on hygiene, sanitation, and policing, worked as Bentham's secretary in his later years.[^88] Bentham bequeathed Chadwick a large legacy in recognition of his service and their intellectual collaboration.[^89] Thomas Southwood Smith, a surgeon and close friend, would play the crucial role of dissecting Bentham's body according to the directions specified in his will.[^90]

Between 1808 and 1810, Bentham held a personal friendship with Francisco de Miranda, the Latin American revolutionary leader, and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London.[^91] This connection reflected Bentham's international interests and his sympathy with movements for political reform and independence. Bentham was in correspondence with many other influential people of his time, including the economist Adam Smith and leaders of the French Revolution.[^92]

The relationship between Bentham and the Mill family was particularly significant. James Mill became Bentham's disciple, best friend, and follower, helping to propagate Bentham's utilitarian doctrine.[^93] James Mill's son, John Stuart Mill, grew up under the influence of both his father and Bentham, who served as the young Mill's intellectual godfathers.[^94] Though John Stuart Mill would later criticize Bentham for "neglected character in his ethics" and a focus on "self-interest" with a "formidable lack of inspiration," the relationship between Bentham and the Mills represents one of the most important intellectual lineages in modern philosophy.[^95]

Bentham lived at his residence in Queen Square Place in Westminster, London, where he maintained a disciplined routine of writing.[^96] His daily habits included spending eight to twelve hours in intellectual work, producing tens of thousands of pages of manuscripts over his lifetime.[^97] Many of these works remained unpublished at his death, and the Bentham Project at University College London continues the massive scholarly task of editing and publishing the complete works.[^98]

Bentham's personality has been described as both brilliant and eccentric. His dedication to utilitarian principles extended to his instructions regarding his own body after death, requesting that it be preserved as an "auto-icon" to serve educational and philosophical purposes.[^99] He died on June 6, 1832, aged 84, in the company of friends on the eve of the signing of the Great Reform Act—a day before the first Reform Act was given Royal Assent, a reform movement to which his ideas had significantly contributed.[^100]

## Legacy

Jeremy Bentham's legacy extends across multiple disciplines and continues to influence contemporary thought more than two centuries after his most important works were published. He is recognized as the founder of modern utilitarianism, establishing one of the main strands in liberal moral philosophy that remains vibrant in academic and policy discussions.[^101] His principle of utility—that actions should be evaluated based on their consequences for happiness—fundamentally changed how philosophers, legislators, and policymakers approach questions of right and wrong.[^102]

In jurisprudence, Bentham set the parameters for the modern discipline by distinguishing law as it is from law as it ought to be, creating the foundation for legal positivism.[^103] His comprehensive approach to legal codification influenced legal systems around the world, even though his complete Pannomion was never adopted.[^104] The ideas he developed about legal reform, judicial procedure, and evidence law continue to feature in legal education and practice.[^105]

Bentham's influence on nineteenth-century British reform was profound and far-reaching. Both the Reform Bill of 1832 and later reforms in the century reflected Benthamite concerns, including extensions of suffrage, administrative rationalization, and humanitarian improvements in prisons and workhouses.[^106] His ideas about public administration shaped the reforms made during the Victorian era.[^107] The Philosophical Radicals, inspired by his work, became an important political force advocating for democratic reforms and the reduction of aristocratic privilege.[^108]

In economics, Bentham is considered an early precursor of modern welfare economics, and his analysis anticipated the law of "diminishing marginal utility."[^109] His influence on economists extends to figures like Milton Friedman and Henry Hazlitt.[^110] The Law and Economics movement owes a great debt to Bentham, with his pleasure-pain calculus providing a framework similar to cost-benefit analysis.[^111] His proposal to use economic metrics to measure desirability in legal fields helped bridge law and economics in ways that continue to shape policy analysis.[^112]

Contemporary philosophical and economic vocabulary is indebted to Bentham's proclivity for inventing terms. He coined or popularized words such as "international," "maximize," "minimize," and "codification," among many others.[^113] This linguistic legacy reflects the depth of his influence on modern discourse.

The most visible and unusual aspect of Bentham's legacy is his "auto-icon," his preserved skeleton dressed in his own clothes and topped with a wax head, which remains on public display at University College London (UCL).[^114] On February 20, 2020, the auto-icon was relocated from its wooden cabinet in the South Cloisters to its new case in UCL's Student Centre on Gordon Square, where visitors can view it daily.[^115] The attempt to mummify Bentham's head went badly, leaving the skin discolored and stretched, so it was replaced with a wax head, while the mummified head has been stored separately.[^116] This peculiar monument to Bentham reflects his utilitarian belief in the practical value of all things, including human bodies after death.[^117]

The Bentham Project at University College London continues the massive scholarly task of editing and publishing "The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham," with 30 volumes published out of a projected total of 80.[^118] This ongoing work ensures that Bentham's vast corpus of writings, much of which remained unpublished during his lifetime, continues to be made available for scholarly analysis.[^119] Bentham scholarship has flourished since the late 1960s with the appearance of volumes in this new authoritative edition.[^120]

Bentham's ideas about animal rights have proven remarkably prescient, influencing modern animal welfare philosophy and advocacy.[^121] His argument that the capacity to suffer, rather than the capacity to reason, should determine moral consideration laid crucial groundwork for contemporary debates about animal ethics.[^122]

His advocacy for women's rights, including women's suffrage, equal political participation, and the right to divorce, placed him far ahead of his time.[^123] These positions, radical for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, anticipated feminist movements that would emerge later.[^124]

The Panopticon concept, while never built as Bentham envisioned, has had an enduring legacy in architecture, penology, and social theory.[^125] Panopticon-like buildings were constructed in various countries, including nineteenth-century Holland, Illinois (Stateville Correctional Center), and Cuba (Isle of Pines).[^126] The metaphor of panoptic surveillance has been employed to analyze modern phenomena such as CCTV surveillance in public spaces, with scholars calling the spread of surveillance technology an "electronic panopticon."[^127]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers of Bentham emphasize his role as the pre-eminent representative of the Enlightenment and as a pioneering reformer whose ideas promoted human welfare and rational governance.[^128] His utilitarian philosophy provided a systematic, secular framework for ethics and politics at a time when such reasoning was revolutionary.[^129] Supporters argue that Bentham's greatest happiness principle offered a democratic alternative to aristocratic privilege and religious dogma, grounding moral and political decisions in concern for human wellbeing rather than tradition or authority.[^130]

Bentham's contributions to legal reform are widely celebrated. He advocated for a more humane, rational legal system, emphasizing laws' utility over their traditional basis.[^131] His calls for the abolition of slavery, capital punishment, and physical punishment—including corporal punishment of children—placed him among the most progressive thinkers of his era.[^132] Scholars at institutions like UCL emphasize that Bentham "had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself."[^133]

Modern utilitarians celebrate Bentham as the founder of their tradition. Organizations like Utilitarianism.net honor him as a pioneering thinker who established the philosophical foundations for consequentialist ethics.[^134] His influence on subsequent philosophers, particularly John Stuart Mill, helped establish utilitarianism as one of the dominant approaches to moral philosophy.[^135] The clarity and systematic nature of his philosophical method continues to attract adherents who value its apparent objectivity and focus on measurable outcomes.[^136]

Economists and legal scholars praise Bentham's interdisciplinary vision. His work bridging law, economics, and philosophy anticipated modern approaches to policy analysis and law and economics.[^137] The Human Progress organization includes Bentham in its "Heroes of Progress" series, crediting him with promoting ideas that advanced human welfare and rational reform.[^138] His advocacy for individual and economic freedoms, separation of church and state, and freedom of expression align with liberal values that many contemporary scholars continue to champion.[^139]

Defenders also point to Bentham's prescient positions on issues that would only gain widespread acceptance much later, including animal rights and women's equality.[^140] His argument that animals deserve moral consideration based on their capacity to suffer is now widely accepted in animal welfare ethics.[^141] His advocacy for women's political and legal equality, including suffrage and the right to divorce, demonstrates a commitment to egalitarian principles that transcended the prejudices of his time.[^142]

Some Bentham scholars have worked to rescue his reputation from negative interpretations, particularly those stemming from Michel Foucault's critique of the Panopticon. Janet Semple and other scholars argue that Foucault misunderstood Bentham's mature theory of government and that a more careful reading reveals Bentham's commitment to transparency, accountability, and limiting governmental power.[^143]

### Negative Views

Critics of Bentham's philosophy have raised fundamental objections to utilitarianism that continue to generate debate. The most serious concern is that Bentham's system inadequately protects individual rights and can justify what many would consider profoundly unjust outcomes.[^144] The tyranny of the majority problem—that utilitarian calculations might justify harming minorities if doing so produces greater happiness for the majority—remains a central philosophical objection.[^145] Bentham's dismissal of natural rights as "nonsense upon stilts" troubles those who believe rights serve as essential constraints on the pursuit of aggregate welfare.[^146]

The practical difficulty of applying Bentham's felicific calculus has long been recognized as a serious limitation.[^147] Critics point out that measuring and comparing pleasures and pains across different people and situations is not merely difficult but perhaps impossible in any rigorous way.[^148] This makes Bentham's claim to provide a scientific, objective basis for moral and political decisions questionable.[^149] The theory demands more precise information about consequences and their value than human beings can realistically possess.[^150]

Bentham's conception of happiness and human nature has been attacked as overly simplistic and even degrading. The charge that his philosophy is "worthy of only swine" because it makes no qualitative distinctions between pleasures captured a widespread sense that Bentham's framework fails to recognize the full complexity of human experience and value.[^151] His focus solely on pleasure and pain, critics argue, ignores other important dimensions of human life such as justice, dignity, autonomy, beauty, and meaning.[^152]

Karl Marx's critique that Bentham universalized the values of the English bourgeoisie, failing to recognize that people in different socioeconomic contexts have different needs and sources of satisfaction, has influenced socialist and progressive critiques of utilitarian thought.[^153] This criticism suggests that Bentham's supposedly universal and scientific philosophy actually reflected particular class interests and cultural assumptions.[^154]

Michel Foucault's influential interpretation of the Panopticon as a symbol of disciplinary power and surveillance society has profoundly shaped negative assessments of Bentham.[^155] For Foucault and his followers, the Panopticon exemplifies how modern institutions seek to control individuals through internalized surveillance, creating what Foucault called a "carceral culture."[^156] The panoptic principle, critics argue, is not about humanitarian reform but about more efficient mechanisms of social control.[^157] This interpretation has been particularly influential in educational research and critical theory, where Bentham's ideas are often regarded negatively because of their authoritarian implications.[^158]

The demandingness of utilitarian ethics poses another persistent objection. By requiring that agents maximize happiness at all times, Bentham's philosophy seems to set an impossibly high standard that would condemn most ordinary human behavior as immoral.[^159] The requirement of agent-neutrality—that one must not give special preference to family and friends—conflicts with widely held moral intuitions about special obligations.[^160]

Some historians have noted that despite Bentham's progressive positions on many issues, his actual political influence was limited and some of his schemes were impractical or even harmful.[^161] The Panopticon prison, had it been built, might have created the kind of oppressive surveillance environment that Foucault described rather than the humanitarian reform Bentham imagined.[^162] Critics argue that Bentham's rationalist confidence in social engineering underestimated the importance of traditional institutions and organic social development.[^163]
