## Summary
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were Depression-era outlaws who robbed banks, gas stations, and small stores across the Central US. They killed at least 13 people. Ambushed and killed by law enforcement in Louisiana.

## Who they were
- **Bonnie Elizabeth Parker (1910–1934)** and **Clyde Chestnut Barrow (1909–1934)** became famous as a criminal pair during the early 1930s.
- They operated during the Great Depression, when economic stress and uneven law enforcement capacity across rural areas shaped both crime patterns and public attention.
- Their story became emblematic of the era’s “outlaw” mythology, though contemporaneous police reports and later scholarship emphasize the violence of their crimes.

## Crimes and modus operandi (high-level)
- Their group (often referred to as the **Barrow Gang**) carried out armed robberies, vehicle theft, and related offenses across multiple states.
- Targets frequently included **small-town banks**, **gas stations**, and **local stores**, rather than only major financial institutions.
- They relied heavily on **stolen cars**, frequent movement, and knowledge of back roads to reduce the chance of capture.
- Their notoriety rose in part from a combination of press coverage, photographs, and the multi-state nature of the pursuit.

## Career Timeline
| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1909 | Clyde Barrow born in Texas. |
| 1910 | Bonnie Parker born in Texas. |
| 1920s | Both experience the economic turbulence of the period; Clyde has early encounters with theft and incarceration (reported in law enforcement records). |
| 1930 | Clyde’s legal troubles and incarcerations intensify; the foundation for later gang activity forms. |
| 1932 | Bonnie and Clyde become associated as partners; the Barrow Gang commits robberies and car thefts across state lines. |
| 1933 | Public attention increases; photographs and press stories contribute to a national profile. |
| 1934 | A coordinated multi-agency manhunt culminates in an ambush near Bienville Parish, Louisiana. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are killed on May 23, 1934. |

## Law enforcement pursuit and death
- Because the group crossed jurisdictions, the search involved **local police**, **state authorities**, and other cooperating agencies.
- The pursuit is often described as a **manhunt** shaped by limited communication tools of the time, reliance on informants, and coordination between Texas and Louisiana law enforcement.
- They were ultimately killed in an **ambush** in rural Louisiana; accounts commonly cite the ambush as a decisive end to a highly publicized chase.

## Public image and cultural impact
- During the 1930s, some segments of the public viewed bank robbers through a romantic lens, especially amid frustration with institutions during the Depression.
- Over time, historians and biographers have generally portrayed the duo less as folk heroes and more as **violent criminals** whose fame was amplified by media.
- Their story later inspired numerous works in film, literature, and popular culture, becoming a shorthand for a charismatic but destructive partnership.

## Legacy (why they are remembered)
- **Media amplification:** photographs, headlines, and the novelty of a multi-state pursuit helped cement their fame.
- **Myth vs. record:** the contrast between romanticized narratives and documented violence remains a central theme in scholarship.
- **Criminal justice history:** their case is frequently referenced in discussions of inter-jurisdictional policing and manhunts in the early 20th century.
