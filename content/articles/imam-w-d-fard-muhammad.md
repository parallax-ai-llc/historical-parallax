## Summary

W.D. Fard Muhammad was the founder of the Nation of Islam in Detroit in 1930. He appeared in the African American community selling silk door-to-door while teaching an unorthodox form of Islam that included Black nationalist theology. He established temples, a parochial school, and a quasi-military organization. He disappeared in 1934 under mysterious circumstances and was deified by his successor Elijah Muhammad. His true identity remains a subject of debate.
