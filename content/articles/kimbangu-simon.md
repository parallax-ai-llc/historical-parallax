## Summary

Simon Kimbangu was a Congolese Baptist catechist who founded the Kimbanguist Church, the largest independent African-initiated church with millions of members. In 1921, he began a healing and prophetic ministry that attracted massive followings and alarmed Belgian colonial authorities. He was arrested and sentenced to death (commuted to life imprisonment) after only six months of ministry. He spent 30 years in prison until his death. His church was later admitted to the World Council of Churches.
