## Summary

Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr. (1931–1997), known to his followers as "Do," was the leader of the **Heaven's Gate** cult. Along with his platonic partner Bonnie Nettles ("Ti"), he orchestrated one of the most bizarre mass suicides in history. Believing they were extraterrestrial beings trapped in human "vehicles" (bodies), Applewhite and his 38 followers committed ritual suicide in 1997 to board a spacecraft they believed was trailing the Comet Hale-Bopp. The group is noted for its early use of the internet for recruitment and its unique mix of Christian theology and UFO science fiction.

## Early Life and Background

### Musician and Teacher
Marshall Applewhite was born in Spur, Texas, the son of a strict Presbyterian minister. He was a gifted baritone and initially sought a career in music and education. He served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps (1954–1956) and later became the head of the music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston.
He married Ann Pearce and had two children, but his life unraveled in the late 1960s. He struggled with his sexuality (engaging in illicit homosexual affairs) and was fired from the university in 1970 over a relationship with a male student. His marriage ended in divorce, and he fell into a deep depression, hearing "voices" and feeling a sense of unique purpose.

### Meeting "Ti" (1972)
In 1972, Applewhite met **Bonnie Nettles**, a registered nurse, at a hospital where a friend was being treated (though stories vary). Nettles was deeply into theosophy, astrology, and biblical prophecy. They clicked instantly, feeling they had known each other in a past life. They came to believe they were the **"Two Witnesses"** prophesied in release 11 of the Book of Revelation.
*   **The Names:** They cycled through several names: "Bo and Peep," "Guinea and Pig," and finally **"Ti and Do"** (referencing musical notes).

## The "UFO Two" Era

### Nomadic Recruitment (1975)
In the mid-1970s, "The Two" traveled the country holding meetings about "Human Individual Metamorphosis." They claimed that a UFO would pick up true believers who shed their "human attachments."
*   **Waldport, Oregon Meeting (1975):** Their most successful event, where over 20 people abandoned their lives overnight to join them. This sparked a media frenzy, with Walter Cronkite reporting on the vanishing group.
*   **Going Underground:** Overwhelmed by attention and facing high dropout rates, the group went into hiding ("The Wilderness") to focus on intensive training.

## Ideology: The "Classroom"

### The Next Level
Applewhite taught that Earth was a "garden" for growing souls. The goal was to graduate to the **"Evolutionary Level Above Human" (TELAH)**. This required completely overcoming their "mammalian" nature.
*   **The Vehicle:** They referred to their bodies not as "self" but as "vehicles" or "containers" provided for this task.
*   **Walk-ins:** Applewhite claimed that he was not a human, but an extraterrestrial soul that had "walked in" to the body of Marshall Applewhite.

### Daily Life and Indoctrination
Heaven's Gate functioned like a mobile monastery.
*   **The Check Partner:** Members were assigned a "Check Partner" to monitor each other for "human" behaviors (pride, sexuality, independence).
*   **Uniformity:** To erase gender and individuality, members wore identical baggy clothes, had identical buzz cuts, and even adopted unisex names (e.g., Odiody, Glnody).
*   **Diet:** They experimented with extreme diets, including the "Master Cleanse" (lemonade and maple syrup only) and a diet consisting solely of cinnamon rolls, to break their attachment to food. at one point they ate with a specific number of chews per bite.
*   **Castration:** To permanently defeat the "pudenda" (sexual urges), Applewhite and seven other male members voluntarily underwent surgical castration.

## Comparison to Other Cults
Unlike Jim Jones or David Koresh, Applewhite did not seek to sexually exploit his followers or stockpile weapons for a war against the government. The group was quiet, non-violent, and intensely focused on internal "overcoming." They utilized the early World Wide Web, running a web design firm called "Higher Source" to fund their mansion rental. As a result, they were highly skilled in technology.

## The End: Hale-Bopp and "The Departure"

### The Sign
In 1996, amateur astronomers discovered the Comet Hale-Bopp. An internet rumor circulated that a "companion object" (a spaceship) was hiding in the comet's tail. Applewhite seized on this as the "marker" they had been waiting for. He told the group that Ti (Nettles, who had died of cancer in 1985) was piloting the ship to pick them up.

### The Suicide Ritual (March 1997)
The group rented a sprawling mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Over three consecutive days (March 24-26), they systematically committed suicide in shifts.
*   **Method:** They ate applesauce or pudding mixed with phenobarbital, washed it down with vodka, and then tied plastic bags over their heads to ensure death.
*   **Aftermath:** Survivors of the previous shift would tidy the bodies, removing the bags and covering the deceased with purple shrouds.
*   **Scene:** When police arrived, they found 39 bodies lying neatly on bunk beds. Each member was dressed in a black shirt, sweatpants, and brand-new black-and-white **Nike Decades** sneakers. Each had a packed bag and exactly $5.75 in their pocket (for "interplanetary toll," a joke derived from Mark Twain).
