## Summary

Otto Hahn was a German chemist who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of nuclear fission. Together with Fritz Strassmann, he discovered that uranium nuclei split when bombarded with neutrons. His collaborator Lise Meitner, who provided the theoretical explanation of fission, was controversially excluded from the Nobel Prize. Nuclear fission became the basis for both nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.
