## Summary

Keith Rupert Murdoch, born March 11, 1931, is an Australian-American former media mogul who built one of the world's most influential media empires spanning newspapers, television, film, and digital platforms across five continents. From inheriting two Australian newspapers at age 21, he transformed News Corporation into a global powerhouse including Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, and HarperCollins publishers. His career has been marked by both extraordinary business success and profound controversy, including the 2011 phone hacking scandal that closed the News of the World. Murdoch retired in November 2023, passing control to his son Lachlan, leaving behind a legacy that fundamentally reshaped journalism, conservative media, and political discourse in the English-speaking world.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Keith Rupert Murdoch was born on March 11, 1931, on a small farm about 30 miles south of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.[^3] He was the second of four children born to Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch (1885–1952) and Dame Elisabeth Joy Greene (1909–2012).[^4] Of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, Murdoch went by his middle name "Rupert" from birth, honoring his maternal grandfather.[^5]

The family farm, named Cruden Farm after the Scottish village from which both parents had emigrated, provided an idyllic childhood where young Rupert learned to ride horses at age five alongside his two sisters and brother.[^6] His father Keith Murdoch was a prominent Australian journalist who owned several newspapers including the Herald in Melbourne, the Courier-Mail in Brisbane, and the News and Sunday Mail.[^7] Sir Keith gained international recognition for revealing the truth about Britain's disastrous Gallipoli campaign during World War I, his reporting influencing the British government's decision to withdraw troops from Turkey.[^8] His mother Elisabeth was later honored as Dame of the British Empire for her welfare activism.[^9]

This journalistic heritage profoundly shaped young Rupert's worldview and ambitions. He attended Geelong Grammar School, one of Australia's most prestigious private schools, before moving to England to study philosophy, politics, and economics at Worcester College, Oxford.[^10] At Oxford, Murdoch became known for his left-wing political views, earning the nickname "Red Rupert" for keeping a bust of Lenin in his rooms.[^11] He was an active member of the Oxford University Labour Party and even stood for secretary of the Labour Club.[^12] After receiving his master's degree in 1953, Murdoch briefly worked as an editor on Lord Beaverbrook's London Daily Express, where he gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would become a hallmark of his career.[^13][^14]

---

## Rise to Power

Murdoch's ascent to media dominance began abruptly in 1952 when his father died suddenly, forcing the 21-year-old to return from Oxford to take charge of the family business.[^15] He inherited the Adelaide News and became its editor and publisher in 1953, joining the board of News Ltd.[^16] His apprenticeship at Beaverbrook's sensationalist tabloid proved formative—Murdoch embraced the philosophy that "newspapers were meant to entertain, not educate."[^17] This approach, characterized by what The Nation dubbed the "four S" model—"scare headlines, sex, scandal, and sensation"—would define nearly every major acquisition throughout his career.[^18]

In 1964, Murdoch launched The Australian, the country's first national newspaper, establishing his credentials beyond tabloid journalism.[^19] His expansion into Britain began in 1969 with the acquisition of News of the World, which he transformed into the most widely read English-language weekly in the world through aggressive tabloid tactics.[^20] This was followed by purchasing The Sun in 1969, where he introduced the controversial topless "Page 3" girls that became both infamous and commercially successful.[^21]

Murdoch's entry into the American market proved more challenging but ultimately transformative. In 1973, he acquired the San Antonio Express and San Antonio News, followed by purchasing the New York Post for $30 million in 1976.[^22] To facilitate his American expansion and comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, Murdoch became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1985, renouncing his Australian citizenship.[^23] That same year, he purchased 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, laying the groundwork for what would become the Fox Broadcasting Company.[^24]

The formation of the Fox Broadcasting Company in October 1986, built around six television stations purchased from Metromedia, represented a watershed moment.[^25] Fox achieved remarkable success with programs like The Simpsons and The X-Files, breaking the three-network monopoly that had dominated American television.[^26] In 1987, Murdoch acquired U.S. publisher Harper & Row, merging it with UK publisher Collins in 1989 to form HarperCollins, one of the world's largest English-language publishers.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Rupert Murdoch's career achievements represent an unparalleled transformation of the global media landscape. In 1979, he founded News Corporation as a holding company for his expanding media properties, creating a structure that would eventually control hundreds of local, national, and international publishing outlets worldwide.[^28][^29]

Perhaps his most consequential achievement was the creation of Fox News Channel in 1996. After gaining experience with Britain's Sky News, launched in 1989 as Europe's first 24-hour news channel, Murdoch announced in January 1996 his plan for a 24-hour American news channel, stating that "The appetite for news – particularly news that explains to people how it affects them – is expanding enormously."[^30][^31] He hired former NBC executive and Republican political strategist Roger Ailes as founding CEO in February 1996.[^32] Fox News launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers, employing the slogan "Fair and Balanced"—described as a "blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr. Ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks."[^33][^34]

Fox News fundamentally reshaped American political discourse, becoming a powerful force in American political life and playing a central role in reshaping the Republican Party, driving it rightward and discouraging compromise.[^35] Murdoch's asymmetrical influence over the Republican Party brought him significant business and political power.[^36] His satellites came to deliver TV programs across five continents, he published 175 newspapers including The New York Post and The Times of London, and his Fox Network reached more than 40% of the United States.[^37]

In 2007, Murdoch achieved another major coup by acquiring Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, for $5.6 billion, adding America's most respected business newspaper to his portfolio.[^38] His business acumen led to a 2013 corporate restructuring that split News Corporation's assets into two entities: News Corp (focusing on publishing) and 21st Century Fox (entertainment and broadcasting).[^39] In March 2019, Walt Disney closed its $71 billion acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's film and television assets, one of the largest media deals in history.[^40]

Murdoch received numerous honors for his achievements, including appointment as Companion of the Order of Australia in 1984, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II in 1998, and induction into both the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame (2013) and the Television Academy Hall of Fame (2014).[^41][^42][^43] Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that Murdoch "arguably has had more impact on the wider world than any other living Australian."[^44]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Rupert Murdoch's career has been deeply marred by ethical scandals and allegations of corrupting journalism for political and financial gain. The most damaging was the phone hacking scandal that engulfed his British tabloids. Beginning in the 1990s and continuing until 2011, employees of Murdoch's News of the World engaged in phone hacking, police bribery, and exercising improper influence in pursuit of stories.[^45][^46]

The scandal's full magnitude emerged in July 2011 when it was revealed that journalists had hacked the phones of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, relatives of deceased British soldiers, and victims of the July 7, 2005 London bombings.[^47] Mounting evidence indicated widespread illegal and unethical behavior, notably hacking mobile phone mailboxes belonging to celebrities, murder victims, and British soldiers killed in Afghanistan.[^48] Amid public outrage, Murdoch shuttered the 168-year-old News of the World—until that point Britain's best-selling tabloid—on July 13, 2011.[^49] The scandal also derailed Murdoch's £7.8 billion bid to take full control of BSkyB, with his company withdrawing its proposal hours before the House of Commons was due to debate a motion calling for its withdrawal.[^50]

To date, News Corp has paid an estimated $1.5 billion in settlements and costs associated with the hacking scandal.[^51] Over 100 people were arrested in connection with illegal acquisition of confidential information, with over 90 arrested or rearrested since police investigations were renewed in 2011, and 26 formally charged with crimes.[^52] In 2024, Murdoch was accused in court of personally knowing about phone hacking and other illegal acts by his British tabloids stretching back nearly two decades—far earlier than he admitted—and giving "knowingly false" evidence under oath.[^53] In 2023, former British government officials alleged their voicemails were hacked not only for scandalous copy but also to aid News Corp's corporate agenda, including blocking a $15 billion takeover of a European broadcaster.[^54]

Beyond hacking, Murdoch's media outlets have faced extensive criticism for right-wing bias, disseminating misinformation, and undermining democratic discourse. Many of his newspapers and television channels have been accused of misleading coverage to support his business interests and political allies, with critics linking his influence to major political developments in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia.[^55] Fox News settled with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in 2023 after Fox hosts falsely accused Dominion of rigging the 2020 presidential election.[^56]

Academic Steven Barnett, communications professor at the University of Westminster, stated that Murdoch "has done more to poison the well of decent, ethical journalism than any other individual in the English-speaking world."[^57] Scholars have identified his media empire as having "built a rogue publishing empire, dedicated to a culture of bullying, deceit, misogyny, homophobia and racism, and it is a culture that cares little for the basic principles of accurate, honest, ethical journalism."[^58] Academic studies found clear evidence of bias against the scientific consensus on climate change across his outlets.[^59]

## Personal Life

Rupert Murdoch's personal life has been as dramatic as his business career, marked by five marriages and six children. He first married Patricia Booker, a former department store model and flight attendant, in 1956 when he was 25.[^60] They had one daughter, Prudence, born in 1958, before divorcing in 1967.[^61]

Just 17 days after divorcing Patricia, Murdoch married Anna Maria Torv (later Anna Murdoch Mann), a Scottish journalist of Estonian descent who worked on his Sydney Daily Telegraph.[^62] Their 32-year marriage produced three children: Elisabeth (born 1968), Lachlan (born 1971), and James (born 1972).[^63] Anna received a settlement of $1.2 billion in assets upon their 1999 divorce.[^64]

Seventeen days after divorcing Anna, the 68-year-old Murdoch married 30-year-old Chinese-born Wendi Deng on June 25, 1999.[^65] They had two daughters: Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003).[^66] Notably, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is Grace Murdoch's godfather.[^67] Murdoch filed for divorce from Wendi in June 2013, citing irreconcilable differences.[^68]

In 2016, Murdoch surprised the world by marrying Jerry Hall, the former supermodel and long-time partner of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger.[^69] However, by 2022, growing differences led to their separation.[^70] At age 93, Murdoch married for the fifth time in June 2024 to Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old retired Russian molecular biologist.[^71] They reportedly met through Murdoch's third wife, Wendi Deng.[^72]

Murdoch's family dynamics became intensely scrutinized during succession planning. Under the Murdoch Family Trust established after his 1999 divorce, voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch and his children from his first two marriages (Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James), while his daughters with Wendi Deng share in proceeds but have no voting privileges.[^73] In 2024, a contentious court battle erupted when three of his children—Elisabeth, Prudence, and James—challenged Rupert's attempt to amend the family trust to ensure eldest son Lachlan retained sole control of News Corp and Fox Corp.[^74] In September 2025, they reached a settlement giving Lachlan ownership of Murdoch's media empire.[^75]

## Legacy

Rupert Murdoch's legacy represents one of the most consequential and controversial careers in media history. He transformed a small inheritance of two Australian newspapers into a global media empire controlling hundreds of publishing outlets, television networks, film studios, and digital platforms across five continents.[^76] His empire fundamentally reshaped journalism, pioneering tabloid sensationalism in Britain, expanding pay-TV services globally, and leveraging broadcasting to shape public opinion on an unprecedented scale.[^77]

Murdoch's most enduring impact may be his transformation of the American political and media landscape through Fox News. The network fundamentally altered political discourse, creating what scholars describe as a "fragmented media landscape" with "echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs."[^78] Critics argue this contributed to political polarization and erosion of trust in news sources, with dire consequences for democracy and public discourse.[^79] His close relationships with successive prime ministers and presidents, from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to David Cameron and Donald Trump, exemplified his extraordinary political influence.[^80] A former Blair spokesman referred to Murdoch as "effectively a member of Blair's cabinet."[^81]

In the United Kingdom, Murdoch's newspapers claimed credit for electoral outcomes, most famously with The Sun's headline "It's The Sun Wot Won It" after the 1992 election.[^82] His media empire played a significant role promoting Brexit, with 40 years of anti-European stories in The Sun having accumulated impact beyond the referendum campaign itself.[^83] Murdoch controls over 30% of the UK press, including the country's top-selling daily and Sunday tabloids.[^84] His dislike of the EU reflected both his desire to maintain unrestricted power over UK politics and his preference for a small state resistant to media regulation.[^85]

Scholars characterize Murdoch as the "archetypal modern media mogul" who had "singular impact" on the world's media industry over a 50-year period.[^86] Academic analyses describe a central contradiction: he is "one of the best known and yet most unknowable figures" operating in the "bewildering shadowy worlds" of his media empire.[^87] His influence on journalism introduced a style characterized by sensationalism and visual content that forced established outlets to reevaluate their strategies.[^88] Critics argue his media favored sensationalism over substantive journalism, ultimately proving "quite corrosive to the sense of fair play in journalism."[^89]

Economically, Murdoch's net worth reached approximately $19.5 billion by 2024, making him one of the world's wealthiest individuals.[^90] He retired in November 2023 at age 92, transitioning to chairman emeritus and passing control to his son Lachlan.[^91] Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's assessment remains apt: Murdoch "arguably has had more impact on the wider world than any other living Australian."[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters credit Rupert Murdoch with transforming global media and saving newspapers from extinction. They herald his love for journalism and credit him with rescuing the British newspaper industry through aggressive business practices and willingness to challenge union power in the 1980s.[^93] His repeated declarations of the importance of investment in editorial and journalistic resources have been welcomed by some media scholars.[^94]

Defenders emphasize Murdoch's entrepreneurial vision and risk-taking that created thousands of jobs and built media outlets that millions chose to consume. They argue that Fox News filled a genuine market demand for conservative-oriented news coverage, breaking what they viewed as a liberal monopoly in mainstream media.[^95] His acquisition of struggling newspapers like The Times prevented their closure, preserving important journalistic institutions.[^96] Business scholars recognize his innovative strategies in breaking into established markets, his prescient understanding of technological shifts from print to broadcast to digital, and his ability to identify consumer appetites before competitors.[^97]

Supporters also note that Murdoch's tabloid approach democratized news consumption, making newspapers accessible to working-class readers who found traditional broadsheets elitist and dull.[^98] His 70-year career demonstrated remarkable adaptability across continents, technologies, and media formats.[^99] Those who worked with him often described his genuine passion for journalism, his hands-on involvement in editorial decisions, and his willingness to invest in quality content when it served business objectives.[^100]

### Negative Views

Critics present a far darker assessment of Murdoch's legacy, arguing he systematically debased journalism and corrupted democratic discourse for profit and political influence. Steven Barnett, communications professor at the University of Westminster, stated that Murdoch "has done more to poison the well of decent, ethical journalism than any other individual in the English-speaking world."[^101] Academic research describes his empire as "a rogue publishing empire, dedicated to a culture of bullying, deceit, misogyny, homophobia and racism" that "cares little for the basic principles of accurate, honest, ethical journalism."[^102]

Scholars argue that while Murdoch did not cause right-wing populism, "it enabled it, promoted it, and profited from it," helping to "elevate marginal demagogues and mainstream ethno-nationalism" while politicizing "the very notion of truth."[^103] The phone hacking scandal provided concrete evidence of systematic lawbreaking and ethical violations, with over 100 arrests and $1.5 billion in settlements.[^104] Critics emphasize that Murdoch was accused in 2024 of personally knowing about illegal activities far earlier than admitted and giving "knowingly false" evidence under oath.[^105]

Academic analyses highlight Murdoch's "asymmetrical influence over the Republican Party" and his role in political polarization that has proven "quite corrosive" to democratic norms.[^106] Research documents his outlets' negative campaigns that amount to "mobilisation of 'flak' against critical perspectives and perceived enemies," creating a "chilling effect upon academic freedom and media scholarship."[^107] Two academic studies found clear bias against scientific consensus on climate change across his media empire.[^108]

Critics argue his journalism philosophy—that "newspapers were meant to entertain, not educate"—represented a fundamental betrayal of journalism's democratic function.[^109] His legacy includes erosion of trust in media institutions, fragmentation into tribal echo chambers, and prioritization of profit and political power over truth and public service.[^110] As one analysis concluded, Murdoch's legacy "serves as a reminder that media can either be a powerful tool for enlightenment or a weapon for division."[^111]
