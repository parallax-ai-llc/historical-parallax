## Summary

Andreas Vesalius was a Flemish anatomist and physician who is considered the founder of modern human anatomy. His magnum opus 'De Humani Corporis Fabrica' (On the Fabric of the Human Body) revolutionized the study of anatomy through detailed dissection and accurate illustrations. He challenged many of Galen's long-accepted anatomical errors through direct observation. Vesalius established anatomy as a science based on empirical evidence rather than ancient authority.
