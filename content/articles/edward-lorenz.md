## Summary

Edward Lorenz founded chaos theory when he discovered that tiny differences in initial conditions could produce vastly different weather outcomes — the 'butterfly effect.' His 1963 paper on deterministic nonperiodic flow demonstrated that weather is inherently unpredictable beyond about two weeks. His work revolutionized mathematics, physics, and meteorology.
