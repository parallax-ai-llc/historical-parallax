## Overview

The 2008 Mumbai attacks (often referred to in India as **26/11**) were a series of coordinated shooting and bombing attacks across Mumbai lasting four days. 10 members of **Lashkar-e-Taiba**, an Islamic terrorist organization from Pakistan, infiltrated the city by boat. They attacked 12 locations, including the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (train station), the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, and the Oberoi Trident. The attackers were trained in commando tactics and armed with AK-47s, grenades, and GPS devices. It was the first time the world watched a "fedayeen" (suicide commando) attack unfold live on 24-hour news in a major global city.

## The Siege

**The Train Station (CST):**
Two attackers (Kasab and Khan) opened fire on commuters, killing 58 people in 90 minutes.
**The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel:**
Attackers went room to room, executing guests and setting fires. They held hostages for 60 hours.
The iconic image of the burning Taj dome became the symbol of the attack.
**Nariman House (Chabad House):**
A Jewish community center was targeted, and the Rabbi and his wife were tortured and killed.

## The Response

The Mumbai Police were hopelessly outgunned (armed with vintage rifles vs. AK-47s).
It took days for the NSG (National Security Guard) commandos to arrive from Delhi.
**Ajmal Kasab:** The only attacker captured alive. He confessed that they were trained in Pakistan and coordinated by handlers via VoIP phones during the attack. He was hanged in 2012.
