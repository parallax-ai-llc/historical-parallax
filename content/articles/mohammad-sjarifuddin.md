## Summary

Amir Sjarifuddin Harahap (27 April 1907 – 19 December 1948) was an Indonesian politician and journalist who served as the second Prime Minister of Indonesia from 1947 to 1948.[^1] A Christian convert from a Muslim Batak family and a committed Marxist, he was a major leader of the left wing during the Indonesian National Revolution.[^2] His political career was marked by fierce anti-fascist activism, underground resistance against Japanese occupation, and contentious negotiations with the Dutch, culminating in his execution following the failed Madiun Affair of 1948.[^3] Sjarifuddin remains one of Indonesia's most controversial political figures, revered by leftist historians as a nationalist martyr while condemned by others as a communist insurgent.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Amir Sjarifuddin Harahap was born on 27 April 1907 in Medan, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), into the Sumatran Batak aristocracy.[^5] He was the eldest of seven children in a family with deep legal traditions—both his grandfather and father were prosecutors.[^6] His father, Djamin Harahap, bore the noble title Sultan Soripada Harahap and worked as a prosecutor in Medan, while his mother, Basunu Siregar, came from a respected Malay-Islamic community.[^7]

Amir's family background was religiously complex. His grandfather, Mangaraja Monang, was a Batak nobleman who had been baptized into Christianity and given the name Ephraim.[^8] However, Amir's father later converted to Islam after marrying his devout Muslim mother.[^9] This religious diversity within his family would foreshadow Amir's own spiritual journey and the unique position he would occupy in Indonesian society as a Christian socialist leader.

In August 1921, fourteen-year-old Amir and his older cousin, Todung Sutan Gunung Mulia, departed for the Netherlands to pursue their education.[^10] Amir was given the traditional title of Sutan Gunung Sualoon, befitting his aristocratic lineage.[^11] In the Netherlands, he studied at Haarlem and later enrolled at Leiden University, one of Europe's most prestigious institutions.[^12] During his time at Leiden, Amir became intellectually engaged with both Eastern and Western philosophy under the tutelage of the Theosophical Society.[^13]

At Leiden, Amir became a member of the board of the Gymnasium student association in Haarlem and was actively involved in the Batak student organization Jong Batak.[^14] It was during this formative period in the Netherlands that Amir underwent his dramatic religious conversion. In 1931, he converted from Islam to Christianity, a decision that was influenced by his increasing interest in Christianity and the Bible during his studies.[^15] This conversion would make him a rare figure in Indonesian politics—a Christian from a Muslim Batak family who would later lead socialist and communist movements.

However, Amir's European education was cut short in September 1927 when he was forced to return to Indonesia due to family troubles.[^16] His father had lost his position as Chief Prosecutor after assaulting a prisoner, creating a family crisis that required Amir's return despite his friends urging him to complete his studies at Leiden.[^17] Back in Indonesia, he continued his legal education at the Rechts Hogeschool (Law School) in Batavia (now Jakarta), where he eventually obtained his law degree.[^18]

## Rise to Power

Amir Sjarifuddin's political ascent began in the 1930s during the waning years of Dutch colonial rule. His return to Indonesia coincided with a period of growing nationalist sentiment and increasing opposition to both Dutch colonialism and the rising threat of international fascism. Amir quickly established himself as one of the most articulate and committed young intellectuals in the independence movement.

In 1935, Amir secretly joined the underground Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), though this membership would remain hidden for over a decade.[^19] Publicly, he positioned himself as a progressive nationalist and anti-fascist activist. In 1937, he led a group of younger Marxists in founding Gerindo (Gerakan Rakyat Indonesia, or Indonesian People's Movement) on April 17, establishing it as a radical cooperative party that advocated for democratic reforms, labor rights, and opposition to Dutch colonial rule.[^20] Gerindo identified international fascism as its primary enemy, distinguishing it from earlier nationalist movements.[^21]

Before the German invasion of the Netherlands, Amir personally led and promoted boycotts against trade with Japan, recognizing the imperial threat that Japan posed to Southeast Asia.[^22] As the Dutch East Indies was a major exporter of raw materials to East Asia, these boycotts represented a significant political statement. Amir was a vocal opponent of both European fascism and Japanese imperialism, establishing himself as one of the most principled anti-fascist voices in the colony.

When Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Amir's prominent role in anti-Japanese campaigns led the head of Dutch intelligence to provide him with 25,000 guilders to organize an underground resistance movement.[^23] This funding enabled Amir to establish resistance networks through his Marxist and nationalist connections. Amir Sjarifuddin and Sutan Sjahrir were among the very few prominent Indonesian politicians who actively resisted Japanese occupation, in stark contrast to figures like Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta who chose cooperation.[^24]

The Japanese arrested Sjarifuddin in 1943 for his underground activities.[^25] He faced execution, but his life was spared only through the intervention of Sukarno, whose immense popularity among Indonesians made him invaluable to the Japanese war effort.[^26] Sukarno's intercession saved Amir's life, though it would create a complex debt and relationship between the two men that would influence Indonesian politics for years to come.

Following Japan's surrender in August 1945, Indonesia's independence was proclaimed on August 17. Amir was appointed to the Republic's first cabinet on September 4, 1945, as Minister of Information, despite his fate being unknown at the time as he was still imprisoned.[^27] Upon his release on October 1, 1945, he promptly assumed his ministerial duties.[^28] On November 14, 1945, he was appointed Minister of People's Security (later renamed Minister of Defense) in the First Sjahrir Cabinet, a position he would hold until 1948.[^29]

Amir and his colleagues from the illegal underground PKI and the pre-war Gerindo movement formed the Socialist Party of Indonesia (Parsi) on November 1, 1945.[^30] The primary objective of Parsi was Indonesian independence from colonial rule, to be followed by the construction of a socialist society.[^31] At a two-party conference on December 16-17, 1945, Amir's Parsi merged with Sjahrir's Socialist People's Party (Paras) to form the Socialist Party (PS), with Sjahrir as chairman and Amir as vice chairman.[^32]

## Major Achievements

### Underground Resistance and Anti-Fascist Leadership

Amir Sjarifuddin's most significant early achievement was his organization of underground resistance against Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. Unlike many Indonesian nationalist leaders who collaborated with the Japanese, Amir maintained his principles and actively worked to undermine the occupation.[^33] Using the 25,000 guilders provided by Dutch intelligence, he established resistance networks that operated throughout the occupation period.[^34] His willingness to face execution for these activities demonstrated extraordinary courage and commitment to anti-fascist principles.

The founding of Gerindo in 1937 represented another major achievement, as it created one of the most significant cooperative parties in the years leading to World War II.[^35] Gerindo's objectives included establishing a fully Indonesian legislature and advancing democratic reforms while maintaining a clear anti-fascist stance.[^36] This positioned Amir as a leader who could bridge nationalist aspirations with progressive social ideology.

### Cabinet Leadership During Revolution

As Minister of Information (1945-1946) and Minister of Defense (1945-1948), Amir played crucial roles in establishing the institutional foundations of the new Republic of Indonesia.[^37] As Defense Minister, he oversaw the organization and coordination of Indonesia's armed resistance against Dutch attempts to reassert colonial control. During the First Sjahrir Cabinet, the state defense function fell under his authority as Minister of Public Security, a position later formalized as Minister of Defense.[^38]

Amir aligned himself with the diplomatic faction of Indonesian leaders, emphasizing the need for international recognition and the formation of sound political structures rather than relying solely on armed struggle.[^39] This diplomatic approach, shared with Sjahrir, sought to gain international support—particularly from the newly formed United Nations—for Indonesian independence. Both Sjarifuddin and Sjahrir were instrumental in organizing and mobilizing radical youth groups that pressured senior leaders to hasten the declaration of independence while simultaneously pursuing diplomatic recognition.[^40]

### Prime Ministerial Service

The Third Sjahrir Cabinet fell in June 1947 due to disagreements over the implementation of the Linggadjati Agreement and subsequent negotiations with the Dutch.[^41] Following its resignation on June 27, 1947, President Sukarno convened leaders from the Masyumi Party, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), the Socialist Party, and the Labour Party to form a new government.[^42] On July 3, 1947, an agreement was reached between the PNI, the Socialist Party, the Labour Party, and the Masjumi breakaway Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII) to support Amir Sjarifuddin as Prime Minister.[^43]

The First Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet, which served from July 3 to November 11, 1947, faced the enormous challenge of negotiating with the Netherlands during the first Dutch "police action" (military aggression).[^44] Ironically, before becoming Prime Minister, Amir and his colleague Wikana had condemned the concessions that Sjahrir had made to the Dutch, contributing to the fall of the Third Sjahrir Cabinet.[^45] Now in power himself, Amir faced the same impossible choices between principle and pragmatism.

### Formation of Socialist Infrastructure

Amir's formation of the Socialist Party and his work in building leftist political infrastructure represented a lasting contribution to Indonesian political development. His ability to unite various leftist factions under common banners demonstrated significant political skill. The merger of Parsi and Paras into the Socialist Party created one of Indonesia's most important early political organizations.[^46] His leadership helped establish socialist thought as a major current in Indonesian political discourse, even though his own career would end in tragedy.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Renville Agreement

The most damaging controversy of Amir Sjarifuddin's political career was his role in negotiating and signing the Renville Agreement in January 1948. The agreement was a United Nations Security Council-brokered political accord between the Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic, ratified on January 17, 1948, in an unsuccessful attempt to resolve disputes arising from the 1946 Linggadjati Agreement.[^47] The republican delegation was led by Prime Minister Amir Sjarifuddin, and the negotiations took place aboard the USS Renville anchored in Jakarta Bay.[^48]

The Renville Agreement became highly controversial because it meant the Netherlands only recognized Central Java, Yogyakarta, and Sumatra as part of the Republic of Indonesia.[^49] Indonesian forces (TNI) had to withdraw from their strongholds in Dutch-occupied West Java and East Java, representing massive territorial concessions.[^50] The Indonesian delegation accepted these agreements under very strong pressure from Dr. Frank Graham, the UN mediator, who himself acted under pressure from the U.S. State Department.[^51]

Following intense backlash over the Renville Agreement, for which Amir received the majority of the blame, PNI and Masyumi cabinet members resigned in early January 1948.[^52] On January 23, 1948, with his support base disappearing, Amir resigned from the prime ministership.[^53] The agreement is remembered as a significant territorial and political setback for the Republic that contributed to increased political instability and internal conflict in 1948.[^54]

### Dutch Intelligence Funding

In a later auto-criticism delivered in 1948, Amir Sjarifuddin publicly admitted to having received 25,000 guilders from Dutch intelligence officer Van der Plas to establish an underground movement against the Japanese.[^55] While this funding had enabled his resistance activities during the occupation, the admission became politically explosive during the revolutionary period. Critics accused him of being a Dutch agent, though the funding had occurred in the context of anti-Japanese resistance when Dutch and Indonesian interests temporarily aligned. This revelation damaged his credibility among nationalist hardliners who viewed any cooperation with the Dutch as betrayal.

### Secret Communist Party Membership

Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Amir's political career was his secret membership in the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) since 1935, which he publicly revealed only in 1948 when the veteran communist leader Musso returned from exile in the Soviet Union.[^56] For over a decade, Amir had operated as a covert communist while publicly presenting himself as a democratic socialist. In 1945, he was described as "the most widely known and respected Republican politician to consider himself communist."[^57]

When Musso arrived in Yogyakarta in August 1948, Amir and the leadership of the People's Democratic Front immediately accepted his authority.[^58] Adhering to Musso's Stalinist thinking of a single party of the working class, the major leftist parties in the Front dissolved themselves into the PKI.[^59] This subordination to a Moscow-aligned communist and the revelation of his long-hidden party membership confirmed the suspicions of anti-communist nationalists and undermined his standing among moderates who had supported him as a democratic socialist.

### Formation of Opposition Front

After his resignation as Prime Minister, Amir formed the Front Demokrasi Rakyat (FDR, People's Democratic Front) on February 26, 1948, at a mass meeting in Surakarta.[^60] The FDR consisted of the Socialist Party, PKI, Indonesian Labour Party (PBI), Pesindo (Socialist Youth), and the labor union federation SOBSI.[^61] As the sole organized opposition to the Hatta government, FDR engaged in aggressive street campaigns to gain support among workers, youth, and farmers.[^62]

The FDR's program included opposition to the Renville Agreement, discontinuation of negotiations with the Dutch, and nationalization of all foreign enterprises.[^63] The organization conducted extensive agitation against the Hatta Cabinet's policies, including anti-Hatta campaigns and politicizing labor strikes in Delanggu in June-July 1948.[^64] This confrontational opposition politics contributed to the political polarization that would culminate in the Madiun Affair.

### The Madiun Affair

The Madiun Affair was the final and most catastrophic controversy of Amir's life. On September 18, 1948, a group of PKI supporters took over strategic points in the Madiun area of East Java in what became known as the Madiun Affair.[^65] They killed pro-government officers and announced over the radio the formation of a new "National Front" government.[^66] Caught by surprise by the premature coup attempt, communist leaders including Amir rushed to Madiun to take charge of the government.[^67]

At 10 PM on September 19, 1948, President Sukarno declared that the Madiun revolt was an attempt to overthrow the government of the Republic of Indonesia and that Musso had formed a Soviet government.[^68] At 11:30 PM the same day, Musso replied to Sukarno and declared war against the Indonesian government.[^69] The conflict that ensued was an armed struggle between the Indonesian Republican government and left-wing FDR forces during the National Revolution.[^70]

The debate continues among historians about whether the Madiun Affair was a planned communist coup or a defensive response to provocations. Some scholars argue that local leftist forces were provoked into premature action, while others contend it was a deliberate attempt to seize power. Regardless of intent, the result was catastrophic for the Indonesian left. The Madiun Affair resulted in the deaths of approximately 3,000 to 36,000 communists and sympathizers.[^71] This suppression entrenched anti-communism as a core tenet of Indonesian state ideology, particularly within the armed forces, profoundly shaping Indonesia's political landscape for decades.[^72]

## Personal Life

Amir Sjarifuddin's personal life was marked by the complexities of his religious identity and family background. Born into a Muslim family descended from Batak nobility, Amir's religious conversion to Christianity in 1931 represented a profound personal transformation.[^73] During his time in the Netherlands, he became increasingly interested in Christianity and the Bible, leading to his conversion while studying at Leiden University.[^74]

After his conversion, Amir became an active Christian, delivering sermons in the largest Protestant church in Batak Batavia.[^75] He was well known as a congregant of the HKBP (Batak Christian Protestant Church), making him the only Christian Prime Minister in Indonesian history.[^76] This unique religious identity positioned him at the intersection of multiple communities—Batak, Christian, and socialist—creating a distinctive political profile in predominantly Muslim Indonesia.

Amir was the eldest of seven children and bore the responsibility that came with that position in his aristocratic family.[^77] He came from a family of prosecutors, with both his grandfather and father practicing the profession, which instilled in him a strong sense of justice and legal reasoning.[^78] Unfortunately, historical sources provide limited information about Amir's marital status or children, as the available records focus primarily on his political activities rather than his domestic life.

Those who knew Amir described him as possessing intellectual sophistication combined with revolutionary fervor.[^79] He was known for his eloquence, both in speech and writing, and his ability to articulate complex political and ideological concepts. His blend of Christian faith and Marxist ideology created an unusual philosophical framework that reflected both his spiritual convictions and his commitment to social justice.

His personality appears to have combined idealism with pragmatism, though the balance shifted at different points in his career. His willingness to face execution for his anti-Japanese resistance demonstrated principled courage, while his negotiation of the unpopular Renville Agreement showed a pragmatic recognition of Indonesia's weak negotiating position. His final acceptance of Musso's authority and participation in the Madiun Affair suggested either revolutionary commitment or political miscalculation, depending on one's perspective.

## Legacy

Amir Sjarifuddin's legacy remains deeply contested in Indonesian history, reflecting the ideological divisions that have shaped the nation's political development. His execution on December 19, 1948, transformed him from a controversial politician into a symbol whose meaning different groups continue to dispute.

### Symbol of Leftist Martyrdom

For Indonesian leftists and progressives, Amir represents a principled revolutionary who fought against fascism, colonialism, and capitalism throughout his life. His anti-Japanese resistance when other nationalist leaders cooperated with the occupation demonstrated moral courage.[^80] His efforts to build socialist political infrastructure and advocate for workers' rights established him as a champion of social justice.[^81] His execution without trial by the Republican government is viewed as a tragic injustication and a harbinger of the anti-communist violence that would intensify in subsequent decades.[^82]

The dramatic circumstances of his execution have contributed to his martyrdom narrative. Before the firing squad, Amir and his fellow prisoners sang the Indonesian national anthem "Indonesia Raya," followed by the "Internationale."[^83] Amir then requested a moment to read the Bible and pray as a Christian, asking that the Bible he always carried be placed under his head as a pillow when buried.[^84] His final words before the bullets struck were "Bersatulah kaum buruh seluruh dunia. Aku mati untukmu!" ("Unite, workers of the world. I die for you!").[^85] This scene of defiant revolutionary commitment combined with Christian faith has become iconic in leftist historical memory.

### Stain on Republican Leadership

For anti-communists and many mainstream Indonesian historians, Amir's legacy is that of a traitor who attempted to overthrow the legitimate republican government during its most vulnerable period. The Madiun Affair occurred while Indonesia faced existential threats from Dutch military aggression, making internal rebellion particularly destructive.[^86] From this perspective, Amir subordinated national unity to ideological extremism by accepting Musso's Moscow-aligned leadership and participating in an armed uprising.[^87]

The revelation of his secret PKI membership since 1935 is viewed as deception of his colleagues and the public.[^88] His acceptance of Dutch intelligence funding, while intended for anti-Japanese resistance, compromised his nationalist credentials in the eyes of critics.[^89] The Madiun Affair's failure and brutal suppression provided justification for decades of anti-communist policies and contributed to the political climate that enabled the mass killings of 1965-1966.[^90]

### Complex Historical Assessment

More nuanced historical assessments recognize Amir as a complex figure whose biography illuminates the contradictions and challenges of the Indonesian revolution. His Christian socialist identity represented an alternative to both Islamic nationalism and secular authoritarianism, showing the diversity of Indonesia's early political landscape.[^91] His emphasis on diplomacy and institution-building represented a vision of revolution that valued international legitimacy and political structures.[^92]

The circumstances surrounding the Madiun Affair remain subject to historical debate, with some scholars questioning whether it was a planned coup or a defensive response to provocations against leftist forces.[^93] The execution of Amir and approximately 50 other leftist prisoners without trial as Republican forces retreated from Dutch attacks raised questions about extrajudicial killing and political violence within the revolution.[^94]

### Lasting Influence

Amir Sjarifuddin's historical impact extended beyond his brief life. His work in building leftist political infrastructure inspired subsequent generations of activists and helped establish socialist thought as a significant current in Indonesian politics.[^95] The Madiun Affair's suppression and Amir's execution entrenched anti-communism as a core principle of the Indonesian military, shaping civil-military relations for decades.[^96]

The memory of the Madiun Affair profoundly influenced Indonesian politics, particularly the Indonesian Communist Party's strategy in the 1950s and early 1960s. The trauma of Madiun made PKI leaders extremely cautious about armed confrontation with the military, a factor that contributed to the party's vulnerability during the 1965 coup and subsequent massacres.[^97]

Today, Amir Sjarifuddin remains a figure whose assessment depends heavily on one's ideological perspective. Survivors of the 1965-1966 anti-communist massacres and their descendants often view him as a forerunner who suffered the same political violence they experienced.[^98] Meanwhile, mainstream Indonesian education and official history have largely marginalized his contributions, reflecting the enduring influence of anti-communist ideology in national narratives.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Amir Sjarifuddin favorably emphasize his consistency in opposing authoritarianism and imperialism throughout his political career. Dr. John Roosa of the University of British Columbia notes that Amir was among the very few Indonesian leaders who actively resisted Japanese occupation, demonstrating principled anti-fascism when collaboration would have been personally advantageous.[^99] His underground resistance activities from 1942-1945 represented genuine commitment to opposing imperial Japan's brutal occupation.

Historian Rudolf Mrázek has argued that Amir's Christian socialism represented an important alternative political tradition in Indonesian history, one that combined spiritual values with social justice commitments in ways that challenged both conservative Islam and secular authoritarianism.[^100] As Indonesia's only Christian Prime Minister, Amir demonstrated that religious minorities could play central roles in the nation's leadership, embodying a pluralistic vision of Indonesian identity.

Progressive Indonesian historians have reevaluated the Madiun Affair, questioning the official narrative that portrays it as a straightforward communist coup attempt. Some scholars argue that the affair resulted from complex provocations and miscommunications rather than a planned insurrection.[^101] From this perspective, Amir and other leftist leaders were caught in circumstances beyond their control, responding to attacks on their supporters rather than initiating rebellion. The government's brutal suppression and extrajudicial executions, including Amir's, represented political violence that violated the revolutionary principles both sides claimed to uphold.

Labor historians credit Amir with establishing crucial infrastructure for Indonesia's labor movement through his work with SOBSI and other labor organizations.[^102] His advocacy for workers' rights and his efforts to build class consciousness among Indonesian workers laid foundations that survived his death, influencing labor organizing for decades.

International observers at the time, including some U.S. State Department officials, privately acknowledged that the Renville Agreement's terms were extremely unfavorable to Indonesia and that Amir had been pressured into accepting them.[^103] This context complicates the narrative that his downfall resulted from incompetent leadership, suggesting instead that he faced impossible choices with limited bargaining power.

### Negative Views

Anti-communist historians and Indonesian military sources have consistently portrayed Amir Sjarifuddin as a traitor whose actions endangered the Republic during its most vulnerable period. The official Indonesian military history emphasizes that the Madiun Affair diverted resources and attention from the struggle against Dutch colonialism, potentially jeopardizing independence itself.[^104] By initiating armed conflict against the republican government in September 1948, Amir and his associates provided the Dutch with propaganda ammunition and weakened national unity at a critical moment.

Conservative Indonesian scholars highlight Amir's secret PKI membership as evidence of systematic deception.[^105] For over a decade, he presented himself as a democratic socialist while secretly adhering to communist party discipline. This duplicity undermined trust in leftist politicians and contributed to the broader suspicion of communism that characterized subsequent Indonesian politics. His ready acceptance of Musso's Moscow-aligned leadership in 1948 suggested loyalty to international communism over Indonesian nationalism.

Some historians argue that Amir's acceptance of 25,000 guilders from Dutch intelligence, regardless of the anti-Japanese context, established a compromising relationship with colonial authorities.[^106] His 1948 public admission of this funding provided ammunition to his political enemies and raised questions about his autonomy from Dutch influence, even though the funding had occurred years earlier in different circumstances.

Critics of Amir's prime ministership point to the Renville Agreement as evidence of political incompetence and poor judgment.[^107] They note the irony that Amir had condemned Sjahrir for making concessions to the Dutch, then signed an even more unfavorable agreement when he assumed power. The territorial losses codified in the Renville Agreement represented a major setback for the Republic that took years to overcome.

Military historians emphasize that the Madiun Affair resulted in thousands of deaths among both leftists and government forces, creating lasting trauma and political divisions.[^108] The rebellion's failure discredited the Indonesian left for a generation and provided justification for anti-communist policies. From this perspective, Amir's political misjudgments had catastrophic consequences that extended far beyond his own death.

Some scholars argue that Amir's subordination to Musso revealed a lack of independent political judgment, as he allowed a recently returned exile with little knowledge of Indonesia's current situation to dictate strategy.[^109] The rapid dissolution of independent leftist parties into the PKI under Musso's direction eliminated political diversity on the left and created a unified target for anti-communist forces.
