## Summary

Spartacus (c. 111-71 BCE) was a Thracian gladiator who led the largest slave rebellion in Roman history, known as the Third Servile War or the Gladiator War (73-71 BCE). Escaping from a gladiatorial training school with about 70 followers, Spartacus built an army of over 100,000 escaped slaves and defeated multiple Roman armies before being finally crushed by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Though ultimately unsuccessful, Spartacus became an enduring symbol of resistance against oppression, inspiring revolutionaries from Karl Marx to modern filmmakers. His rebellion traumatized Rome and led to 6,000 crucifixions along the Appian Way.
