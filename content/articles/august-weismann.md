## Summary

August Weismann was a German evolutionary biologist who proposed the germ plasm theory, which stated that hereditary information is transmitted only through germ cells (sperm and eggs), not somatic cells. He demonstrated that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited, refuting Lamarckism. His work laid the groundwork for modern genetics and the central dogma of molecular biology.
