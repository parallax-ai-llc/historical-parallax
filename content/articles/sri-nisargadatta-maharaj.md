## Summary

Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj was an Indian Advaita (non-dual) teacher who became famous through the book I Am That, a collection of his dialogues with visitors. A simple shopkeeper in Mumbai, he taught that the fundamental consciousness 'I Am' is the doorway to the absolute. His direct, uncompromising teaching style attracted seekers from around the world. He is considered one of the most important Advaita teachers of the modern era.
