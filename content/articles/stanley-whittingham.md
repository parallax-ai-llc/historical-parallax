## Summary

Stanley Whittingham is a British-American chemist who shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his foundational work on lithium-ion batteries. At Exxon in the 1970s, he demonstrated that lithium ions could be stored in layered materials (titanium disulfide), creating the first rechargeable lithium battery concept that others later improved.
