## Summary

Abdul Hamid II (1842-1918) was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, ruling from 1876 to 1909, and the last sultan to exert effective control over the fracturing state.[^1] He ascended to the throne during a period of profound crisis, promulgated the Ottoman Empire's first constitution in 1876, but suspended it two years later to rule autocratically for three decades.[^2] Known both as a modernizer who advanced education, infrastructure, and pan-Islamic unity, and as the "Red Sultan" for the Hamidian massacres of Armenians, his legacy remains deeply controversial.[^3] He was deposed by the Young Turk Revolution in 1909 and died in exile in 1918.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Abdul Hamid II was born on September 21, 1842, in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I and Tirimüjgan Kadın, a woman of Circassian origin.[^5] His childhood was marked by tragedy when his mother died of tuberculosis when he was just ten years old.[^6] Following her death, he was adopted by his father's legal wife, Perestu Kadın, who became an important influence in his upbringing.[^7]

As an Ottoman prince (şehzade), Abdul Hamid received an extensive education befitting his royal status. He was tutored in Arabic, Persian, and French languages, and unusually for Ottoman princes of his time, he was taught Western music by Italian instructors.[^8] He learned to play the piano and received instruction from distinguished teachers in the palace.[^9] However, his childhood was not easy—he was a weak and sickly child who fell ill frequently, which paradoxically drew special attention and care during his father's reign.[^10]

During the reigns of his father Sultan Abdülmecid I and his uncle Sultan Abdülaziz, Abdul Hamid lived what he later recalled as a comfortable and relatively free life in his mansion in Maslak, a district of Istanbul.[^11] This period of relative freedom would stand in stark contrast to the paranoid seclusion he would later impose upon himself as sultan. The young prince also had the opportunity to travel abroad, visiting London in 1867 where he was photographed by the firm W. & D. Downey, an experience that would inform his later complex relationship with photography and image control.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Abdul Hamid II's path to the throne was paved by extraordinary political turmoil and tragedy within the Ottoman dynasty. He ascended to power on August 31, 1876, at the age of 34, following the deposition of his mentally unstable brother, Murad V, who had proven unfit to rule after only three months on the throne.[^13] The circumstances were even more dramatic than a simple succession—his uncle, Sultan Abdülaziz, had been forcibly deposed and died under mysterious circumstances that many suspected to be murder.[^14]

The empire Abdul Hamid inherited was in crisis. The Ottoman state faced economic collapse, political turmoil, local wars raging in the Balkans, and the looming threat of the Russo-Turkish War that would soon threaten the empire's very existence.[^15] He came to power in the wake of Young Ottoman coups, and many expected him to support liberal constitutional movements.[^16] At his accession, some contemporary observers were impressed by the symbolic gesture he made when he rode practically unattended to the Eyüp Sultan Mosque, where he was presented with the Sword of Osman, the traditional symbol of Ottoman sovereignty.[^17]

Abdul Hamid's early actions appeared to confirm hopes for reform. On December 23, 1876, just months after taking the throne, he promulgated the Ottoman Empire's first constitution, establishing a framework for constitutional monarchy.[^18] However, historians have debated his true motivations. The constitution was introduced primarily to ward off foreign intervention following the empire's savage suppression of the Bulgarian uprising and Ottoman military actions in Serbia and Montenegro.[^19] The cabinet had passed the constitution on December 6, 1876, creating a bicameral legislature with an elected Chamber of Deputies and an appointed Senate, though the sultan's sovereignty remained inviolable and his authority over executive functions unchallenged.[^20]

The first-ever election in the Ottoman Empire was held in 1877, marking what appeared to be a historic transition toward representative government.[^21] Abdul Hamid even reopened the General Assembly with a speech from the throne in which he stated that the first parliament had been "temporarily dissolved until the education of the people had been brought to a sufficiently high level by the extension of instruction throughout the empire."[^22] This promise would prove hollow, as the constitutional experiment would be short-lived.

## Major Achievements

Despite his later reputation for autocracy, Abdul Hamid II oversaw a remarkable period of modernization and development in the Ottoman Empire that laid important foundations for the modern Middle East and Turkey. His achievements in education, infrastructure, and state organization were particularly significant and enduring.

### Educational Transformation

Abdul Hamid II implemented far-reaching educational reforms that transformed the Ottoman Empire's intellectual landscape. During his reign, 18 professional schools were established, including specialized higher education institutions in fields such as engineering, law, education, and fine arts.[^23] In 1900, he founded the Darülfünun, which later became the University of Istanbul, creating the Ottoman Empire's first comprehensive university.[^24] He extended a network of secondary, primary, and military schools throughout the empire, bringing education to previously underserved rural areas.[^25] In a groundbreaking move for the conservative empire, he also oversaw the inauguration of the first schools for girls, substantially expanding educational opportunities for women.[^26] These institutions educated the generation that would later form the leadership of the Turkish Republic, making Abdul Hamid II, ironically, an architect of the state that would later dismantle the Ottoman system.[^27]

He also spearheaded initiatives to enrich the cultural and intellectual landscape, founding institutions like the Museum of Antiquities, the Military Museum, Bayezid Library, and the Yıldız Archive and Library.[^28] These cultural institutions preserved Ottoman heritage and promoted scholarship during a critical period.

### Infrastructure Development

The sultan's modernization drive included massive infrastructure projects that connected the far-flung provinces of the empire. The Ottoman Empire's centralization continued during his reign with the extension of the Rumelia Railway and the Anatolia Railway, and most ambitiously, the construction of the Baghdad Railway.[^29] Railway and telegraph systems were developed extensively, with telegraph lines reaching regions as distant as the Hejaz.[^30]

The Hejaz Railway project, ordered by Abdul Hamid II in March 1900, stands as perhaps his most symbolically important achievement. The railway ran from Damascus to Medina through the Hejaz region, with a branch line to Haifa on the Mediterranean Sea.[^31] Though the original goal was to extend the line from Istanbul beyond Damascus all the way to Mecca, construction reached only to Medina, 400 kilometers short of Mecca.[^32] What made this project unique was its financing—Abdul Hamid II was determined to implement it without borrowing from foreign creditors, as the state was already burdened with debts from other railway projects.[^33] He called on Muslims worldwide to make donations, and he personally contributed 350,000 Ottoman liras from his own funds.[^34] The Hejaz Railway became a concrete expression of his pan-Islamic policy, financed by Muslim contributions from across the globe.[^35]

Beyond railways, Abdul Hamid II oversaw the implementation of horse-drawn and electric tram systems in Ottoman cities, the establishment of docks in various ports, and a comprehensive restructuring of the police force along Western lines.[^36] He also established a retirement fund for civil servants, creating an early social security system.[^37]

### Administrative Reforms

The Ministry of Justice was reorganized during his reign, bringing greater systematization to Ottoman legal administration.[^38] In a broader sense, scholars have argued that Abdul Hamid may be seen as the fulfiller rather than destroyer of the Tanzimat reforms that had begun earlier in the 19th century, as the essence of those reforms was centralization rather than liberalization, and centralization was precisely what Abdul Hamid achieved.[^39]

### Pan-Islamic Policy

Abdul Hamid II used pan-Islamism strategically both to solidify his internal absolutist rule and to rally Muslim opinion outside the empire, thereby creating difficulties for European imperial powers in their Muslim colonies.[^40] This policy threatened Austria through Bosnian Muslims, Russia through Tatars and Kurds, France and Spain through Moroccan Muslims, and Britain through Indian Muslims.[^41] The myth of the caliphate became a useful weapon in the Ottoman diplomatic armory, exploited by Abdul Hamid as a means of deterring European powers from pressing him too hard, lest he create dissension within their own territories.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Abdul Hamid II's reign was marked by controversies that earned him the epithet "Red Sultan" and created a legacy of criticism that persists to this day. His autocratic methods, the Armenian massacres, and his repressive governance have made him one of history's most debated Ottoman rulers.

### The Hamidian Massacres

The most damning chapter of Abdul Hamid's reign was the Hamidian massacres of 1894-1896, systematic killings of Armenians throughout the Ottoman Empire. These massacres resulted in estimated casualties ranging from 100,000 to 300,000 deaths and left 50,000 orphaned children, though figures remain disputed.[^43] French historian Pierre Renouvin stated that 250,000 Armenians were killed based on authenticated documents, while Armenian and other estimates run from 250,000 to as high as 350,000 dead; Turkish estimates, conversely, range from 20,000 to 30,000 killed.[^44]

The massacres were named after the sultan himself, reflecting the widespread belief in his personal responsibility. Abdul Hamid's private first secretary wrote in his memoirs that the sultan "decided to pursue a policy of severity and terror against the Armenians."[^45] Although the massacres primarily targeted Armenians, in some cases they turned into indiscriminate anti-Christian pogroms, including the Diyarbekir massacres where, according to at least one contemporary source, up to 25,000 Assyrians were also killed.[^46]

For over a century, it has been widely believed that the mass violence was state-sponsored, receiving official order, instigation, or sanction from the Hamidian administration.[^47] However, some recent scholars have questioned the narrative that the Hamidian administration orchestrated the massacres "from top to bottom," suggesting this may be an oversimplification, though the debate continues.[^48] His brutal repression of the Armenians earned him the European title "Red Sultan," and the bloodshed remains central to his historical reputation.[^49]

### Autocratic Governance and Suppression of Liberties

In 1878, facing the catastrophic Russo-Turkish War, Abdul Hamid suspended the constitution he had promulgated just two years earlier and dissolved the parliament after only one meeting in March 1877.[^50] He then consolidated his rule by purging the Young Ottomans and curtailing the power of the Sublime Porte, the traditional center of Ottoman administration.[^51] For the next three decades, he ruled as an absolute autocrat.[^52]

His paranoia about being overthrown—like his uncle and half-brother before him—led to the creation of extensive secret police organizations, including the Yıldız Intelligence Agency (founded in 1880) and the Umur-u Hafiye.[^53] The Yıldız Intelligence Agency was the first organized intelligence agency in Turkish history, named after Yıldız Palace where Abdul Hamid resided.[^54] The agency was remarkably extensive: more than 3,000 intelligence reports and journals arrived at Yıldız Palace every month.[^55] Abdul Hamid closely followed people and institutions in cities across Europe and Asia, including Paris, New Delhi, Vienna, Rome, Dubrovnik, Geneva, Cairo, Brussels, and London.[^56]

Eugene Rogan describes the empire under Abdul Hamid II as a police state: "Political activists were imprisoned and exiled, newspapers and magazines were heavily censored, and citizens looked over their shoulders before speaking, fearful of the ubiquitous spies working for the government."[^57] The intelligence agency burned books and shut down gazettes and newspapers critical of the sultan, and dissent was illegal with severe repercussions.[^58] Journalists contended with strict censorship, while the intelligentsia chafed under surveillance.[^59]

For 30 years, Abdul Hamid ruled from seclusion at Yıldız Palace in Constantinople, assisted by his system of secret police, an expanded telegraph network that extended the reach of his autocracy, and severe censorship.[^60] Large sections of the Ottoman intelligentsia were discontent with his repressive policies, which eventually coalesced into the Young Turks movement that would overthrow him.[^61]

### Territorial Losses and Military Defeats

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 brought Abdul Hamid's worst fears to reality—near dissolution of the empire. Russia declared war on April 24, 1877, and the Ottoman Empire fought without help from European allies.[^62] Russia's victory was swift, with the conflict ending in February 1878.[^63] The Treaty of San Stefano imposed harsh terms: the Ottoman Empire granted independence to Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro; gave autonomy to Bulgaria; instituted reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and ceded parts of Dobruja to Romania and parts of Armenia to Russia, while also paying an enormous indemnity.[^64]

Although the Great Powers revised the treaty at the Congress of Berlin to reduce Russia's gains, the Treaty of Berlin (1878) still resulted in the Ottoman Empire experiencing significant territorial losses—a staggering two-fifths of its land and one-fifth of its population, primarily in the Balkans and eastern Anatolia.[^65] In exchange for revision of the treaty, Cyprus was ceded to Britain.[^66] It was initial consensus among many historians that Abdul Hamid's personal rule created an era of stagnation that held the Ottoman Empire back from the otherwise dynamic Belle Époque of late 19th-century Europe.[^67]

## Personal Life

Abdul Hamid II's personal life reflected the traditional polygamous practices of Ottoman sultans, though he maintained stricter control over his household than his predecessors. He had many wives and consorts, but he deliberately did not allow any of them to exercise political power, believing that excessive involvement from women in the imperial family had damaged the reigns of his uncle and father.[^68]

Among his notable consorts were Nazikeda Kadın, his First Consort who bore him one daughter; Safinaz, whom he secretly married in October 1868 and renamed Nurefsun, though she could not adapt to harem life and requested a divorce, which was granted in 1879 (she had no children); and Müşfika Kadın, known for her kindness and modesty, who was Abdul Hamid's favorite among the consorts and remained with him until his death, bearing him a son and a daughter.[^69]

Abdul Hamid II had numerous children from his various consorts. Notable among his sons were Şehzade Mehmed Selim (1870-1937), who did not get along with his father and had eight consorts, two sons, and a daughter; Şehzade Mehmed Abdülkadir (1878-1944), who had seven consorts, five sons, and two daughters; and Şehzade Ahmed Nuri (1878-1944), who had a consort but no children.[^70] One of his daughters, Hamîde Ayşe Sultan, later titled her memoir "My Father, Sultan Abdul Hamid," crafting a personal vindication to counteract what she saw as the distorted public image of the controversial ruler.[^71]

The sultan's personality combined contradictory elements. He was deeply paranoid, fearing assassination and overthrow to the point of creating a massive surveillance state. Yet he was also intellectually curious and skilled with his hands—he practiced carpentry as a hobby and was an accomplished woodworker.[^72] His relationship with modernity was similarly complex. While he restricted circulation of his own photographs within the empire (even demanding that copies be collected after the Abdullah Frères photographers "dared" to print his image without permission in 1880), he simultaneously commissioned thousands of photographs documenting his realm and presented them as diplomatic gifts.[^73]

He spent his final years in captivity, first at Salonica after his deposition in 1909, then at Beylerbeyi Palace in Constantinople after Salonica fell to Greece in 1912.[^74] He spent these last days studying, practicing carpentry, and writing his memoirs in the company of his wives and children.[^75] He died at Beylerbeyi Palace on February 10, 1918, at age 75, and was buried in the Mausoleum of Mahmud II, where his uncle Sultan Abdülaziz and his grandfather Sultan Mahmud II were also interred.[^76] In 1930, his nine widows and thirteen children were granted $50 million from his estate after a lawsuit that lasted five years; his total estate was valued at $1.5 billion.[^77]

## Legacy

Abdul Hamid II's legacy is profoundly contradictory, making him one of the most debated figures in Ottoman and Turkish history. His impact on the region and his historical reputation continue to evolve and provoke passionate disagreement more than a century after his death.

### Foundation for Modern Turkey

Ironically for a sultan deposed by modernizing reformers, Abdul Hamid II's modernizing efforts ultimately laid crucial foundations for modern Turkey. The founders of the Turkish Republic, including Mustafa Kemal Atatürk himself, were educated at schools founded by Abdul Hamid II.[^78] The educational, infrastructural, and administrative systems he established provided the framework upon which the Turkish Republic would be built. In 1878, the sultan inaugurated a new course in domestic and foreign policies that had a lasting impact on the history of modern Turkey and the Middle East.[^79]

### Symbol of Resistance to Western Imperialism

Abdul Hamid II has become a symbol of resistance to Western imperialism, particularly for his famous refusal of Theodor Herzl's offer. In 1896, Herzl, the leader of the Zionist movement, came to Istanbul with an offer to pay the Ottoman Empire's accumulated debt (which stood at a present-day value of $11.6 billion) and provide propaganda support in Europe in exchange for opening Palestinian lands to Jewish settlement.[^80] Herzl offered to pay down 150 million pounds sterling in gold for a charter allowing Zionists to settle in Palestine.[^81]

Abdul Hamid II refused outright, stating: "I cannot sell even a foot of land, for it does not belong to me but to my people. My people have won this Empire by fighting for it with their blood and have fertilised it with their blood. We will again cover it with our blood before we allow it to be wrested away from us."[^82] When Herzl repeated his offer the following year, the answer remained the same.[^83] This refusal has made Abdul Hamid a hero to those who oppose Zionism and view him as a defender of Palestinian land against colonization.

### Political Symbol in Modern Turkey

Abdul Hamid II occupies a unique place in late Ottoman and Turkish history, with the "Hamidian" period (1876-1908) standing out as the only late Ottoman reign known by its sultan's name.[^84] Even in modern Turkey, his legacy is deeply divisive. While secularists see him as a ruthless dictator, others admire his foresight, resilience, and refusal to bow to Western pressure.[^85]

The sultan has long been a subject of controversy between secular republicans and conservatives/Islamists, with the former viewing him as a reactionary, pan-Islamist sultan who suppressed Young Turk opposition, while the latter group adores him as the champion of the Muslim world and the last defender of the Ottoman Empire.[^86] Since the AKP's rise to power in Turkey, scholars have attributed a resurgence in his personality cult to an attempt to check Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's established image as the founder of modern Turkey.[^87]

Debate over Abdul Hamid's place in history continues today, especially in Turkey where it has been the focus of a fascinating and ongoing re-evaluation.[^88] His legacy remains a battleground for competing visions of Turkish identity, Muslim political power, and the proper relationship between Turkey and the West.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Recent scholarship has increasingly challenged the simplistic portrayal of Abdul Hamid II as merely a reactionary despot, highlighting his modernizing achievements and pragmatic statecraft. Bernard Lewis, the renowned Princeton scholar and dean of Middle Eastern history, wrote that "Abdul Hamid was far from being the blind, uncompromising, complete reactionary of the historical legend; on the contrary, he was a willing and active modernizer."[^89]

Contemporary historians have emphasized that recent assessments highlight his promotion of education and public works projects, viewing his reign as a culmination and advancement of the Tanzimat reforms rather than their betrayal.[^90] The reign of Abdul Hamid II (1876-1909) is often regarded as having been a reaction against the Tanzimat, but insofar as the essence of the Tanzimat reforms was centralization rather than liberalization, Abdul Hamid may actually be seen as its fulfiller rather than its destroyer.[^91]

Defenders of Abdul Hamid point to his strategic acumen in navigating the treacherous waters of late 19th-century great power politics. His pan-Islamic policy, while controversial, was a sophisticated tool for maintaining Ottoman influence and deterring European intervention. His refusal to sell Palestinian lands to Zionist interests, despite the empire's desperate financial situation, demonstrated principle and foresight that resonates particularly strongly in the contemporary Middle East.

Some scholars argue that Abdul Hamid's autocracy, while repressive, may have been necessary to hold together a fragmenting empire facing existential threats from both internal nationalist movements and external imperial powers. Whether Abdul Hamid is vilified as a reactionary despot or lauded as a key modernizer of the Ottoman Empire and the last defender of Islam from the encroachments of the West, his reign was crucial to many critical developments affecting Turkey and the modern Middle East.[^92]

### Negative Views

Critics of Abdul Hamid II paint a damning portrait of a paranoid autocrat whose repressive rule and toleration of mass violence overshadow any administrative achievements. He has been long vilified as a reactionary "Red Sultan" for his tyrannical leadership and condoning of atrocities.[^93] His detractors called him the "kızıl sultan" (the red sultan) after the blood they hold him responsible for shedding.[^94]

The initial scholarly consensus was that his personal rule created an era of stagnation which held the Ottoman Empire back from the otherwise dynamic Belle Époque.[^95] Many secularists believe he was an autocrat who held Turkey back from modernizing alongside its European neighbors.[^96] Sultan Abdul Hamid was described as despotic, oppressive, and censorious.[^97]

His surveillance state, with its thousands of spies and pervasive censorship, created a climate of fear that stifled intellectual and political development. Large sections of the Ottoman intelligentsia were discontent with his repressive policies, which coalesced into the Young Turks movement.[^98] The suspension of the constitution and parliament for three decades represented a betrayal of the promise of reform and condemned the empire to autocratic stagnation at precisely the moment when political modernization was most urgently needed.

Most damningly, the Hamidian massacres of Armenians remain an indelible stain on his legacy. Armenians especially suffered from massacres and pogroms at the hands of the Hamidiye regiments.[^99] The scale of the violence, the evidence of state involvement, and the sultan's own statements about pursuing a "policy of severity and terror" against Armenians make him directly responsible for one of the worst atrocities of the late 19th century.[^100]

The contradictory assessments reveal a ruler whose legacy defies simple categorization—a modernizer who ruled through fear, an Islamic champion who created a police state, and a defender of his empire who presided over its accelerating decline.
