## Summary

William Henry Bragg, together with his son Lawrence Bragg, pioneered X-ray crystallography. They shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics — the only father-son team to share a Nobel Prize. He designed the X-ray spectrometer that made crystallographic analysis possible. He later became president of the Royal Society and director of the Royal Institution.
