## Summary

Matteo Ricci was an Italian Jesuit missionary and one of the first Europeans to enter the Forbidden City in Beijing. He pioneered the inculturation approach to mission, adopting Chinese dress and customs while sharing European science and mathematics. He created the first European-style world map in Chinese. His efforts to reconcile Confucianism with Christianity influenced the Chinese Rites controversy.
