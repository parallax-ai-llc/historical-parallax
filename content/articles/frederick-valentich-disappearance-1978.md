## Summary

In one of the most chilling aviation mysteries of all time, 20-year-old Australian pilot **Frederick Valentich** vanished mid-flight while reporting a UFO to air traffic control. On the evening of October 21, 1978, while flying a Cessna 182L over the Bass Strait, Valentich radioed Melbourne Flight Service to report a large aircraft following him.

His final transmissions describe a metallic object with green lights that was "orbiting" above him and playing a "game." His last words before his radio cut out into a strange metallic scraping noise were: **"It is hovering and it's not an aircraft."** No trace of Valentich or his plane was ever found.[^1]

## The Incident

### The Flight

Valentich was on a training flight to King Island. The weather was clear.

- **7:06 PM:** Valentich asks ATC if there is any known traffic below 5,000 feet. ATC confirms there is **no known traffic**.
- **The Object:** Valentich reports a large unknown aircraft with four bright landing lights passing over him at high speed.
- **The Pursuit:** The object begins to circle him. He describes it as "long," "metallic," and having a "green light."
- **The "Game":** He reports the object is "orbiting" on top of him and "playing some sort of game."
- **Engine Failure:** His engine begins to rough idle and cough.

### The Final Transmission

> **Valentich:** "My intentions are - ah - to go to King Island - ah - Melbourne. That strange aircraft is hovering on top of me again... it is hovering and it's not an aircraft."
> **[17 seconds of open microphone with metallic scraping/grating sounds]**
> **[End of transmission]**[^2]

## Theories

### UFO Abduction

The "metallic scraping sound" and sudden disappearance have made this a cornerstone case for abduction theories. Witnesses on the ground reported seeing erratic green lights in the sky around the same time.

### Disorientation / Suicide

Skeptics suggest Valentich became disoriented (flying upside down, mistaking own reflection for lights) or staged his own disappearance. However, the "metallic noise" recorded by ATC remains unexplained, and Valentich was an enthusiastic but capable pilot.

### The Manifold Photo

Years later, a photo taken by a plumber (Roy Manifold) at the same location/time showed a fast-moving object bursting out of the water, fueling theories the object came from the ocean.[^3]
