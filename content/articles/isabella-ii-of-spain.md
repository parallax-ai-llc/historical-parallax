## Summary

Isabella II was Queen of Spain from 1833 until her deposition in 1868, making her the only queen regnant in the history of unified Spain.[^1] Born on October 10, 1830, in Madrid, she ascended to the throne at the age of two following her father Ferdinand VII's death, triggering the bloody Carlist Wars over her disputed succession.[^2] Her tumultuous 35-year reign was marked by constitutional development, modernization efforts, and persistent political instability, ultimately ending with her overthrow in the Glorious Revolution of 1868.[^3] She died in exile in Paris on April 9, 1904, having formally abdicated in favor of her son Alfonso XII in 1870.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Isabella II was born on October 10, 1830, in the Royal Palace of Madrid as the eldest daughter of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies.[^5] Her birth occurred at a critical moment in Spanish dynastic politics. Shortly before Isabella's birth, her father issued the Pragmatic Sanction to revert the Salic Law and ensure the succession of his firstborn daughter, having failed to produce a male heir after three previous marriages.[^6] This decision would prove momentous, setting the stage for decades of civil conflict.

When Ferdinand VII died on September 29, 1833, the infant Isabella was proclaimed sovereign at just two years old, with her mother Queen Maria Christina assuming the regency.[^7] The succession was immediately challenged by her uncle, Ferdinand's brother Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, who rejected the legitimacy of the Pragmatic Sanction.[^8] Carlos's supporters, known as Carlists, represented traditionalist and ultra-Catholic factions who viewed the succession law change as illegitimate and favored absolute monarchy over the liberal constitutional reforms associated with Isabella's regency.[^9]

Isabella was entrusted to the royal governess María del Carmen Machín y Ortiz de Zárate during her childhood.[^10] Her education was notably deficient; contemporary accounts describe her as having received meager instruction, with some sources noting she could scarcely read and was relatively ignorant in basic fields of study.[^11] This lack of preparation would prove significant, as she would assume the reins of government at the extraordinarily young age of thirteen in 1843.[^12] According to historical assessments, she was "essentially illiterate and ignorant in basic fields of study, and like her father, was not very intelligent, making her by native intelligence and training ill-equipped to be a queen."[^13]

Her childhood was overshadowed by the First Carlist War (1833-1840), a brutal conflict that divided Spain between urban liberalism supporting Isabella and rural traditionalism backing Carlos.[^14] The war pitted the poorly paid and poorly equipped regular army of the liberal governments against the semi-guerrilla forces of the Carlists, whose strength lay primarily in the Basque provinces and Navarre.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Isabella's rise to power was intrinsically tied to the complex political dynamics of Spain's transition from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. Her mother María Cristina's regency (1833-1840) recognized that only the liberals could save her daughter's throne from the Carlists, and the minimum demand of all liberals was a constitution.[^16] This necessity led to Spain's adoption of the Royal Statute of 1834 and subsequently the Constitution of 1837, transitioning the nation from absolute to constitutional monarchy.[^17]

The First Carlist War ended with the Convention of Vergara in August 1839, when Don Carlos fled to France.[^18] However, the war had established a pattern of military intervention in politics that would characterize Isabella's entire reign. Following the Carlist defeat, General Baldomero Espartero, associated with the Progressive Party and one of the so-called "espadones" (big swords) who dominated Isabella's reign, used his military faction to oust María Cristina and establish himself as regent from 1841 to 1843.[^19]

Espartero's authoritarian regency proved unpopular, and in 1843 he was deposed by a military pronunciamiento led by Generals Leopoldo O'Donnell and Ramón María Narváez.[^20] The Cortes then declared Isabella of age at only thirteen years old, despite her youth and lack of preparation for governance.[^21] Contemporary observers noted that "she had little preparation for governing, a task which would have bedeviled the most expert politician" and that "Isabel's political instruction was to remain underdeveloped."[^22]

The declaration of Isabella's majority in 1843 inaugurated what historians call the "Isabelline Era," a period that would see the consolidation of the constitutional regime with the promulgation of the Constitutions of 1837 and 1845.[^23] However, from the outset, Isabella's personal rule was characterized by political unrest and a series of uprisings, with palace intrigues, back-stairs influences, barracks conspiracies, and military pronunciamientos becoming regular features of her reign.[^24]

## Major Achievements

Despite the political turbulence that marked her reign, Isabella II's era witnessed significant constitutional development and modernization that transformed Spain. Her government implemented numerous reforms that laid foundations for Spain's transition to a modern liberal state, even as political instability undermined the consolidation of these changes.

### Constitutional and Administrative Reforms

The consolidation of the constitutional regime continued during Isabella's reign with the promulgation of the Constitutions of 1837 and 1845, alongside measures that promoted the introduction of a liberal political, social, and economic model.[^25] Major administrative and legal reforms included the creation of the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) in 1844, an institution that would become fundamental to Spanish law enforcement; the tax and administrative reforms of 1845; the construction of the Palacio de las Cortes (House of Parliament) from 1843-1850; the draft Civil Code of 1851; and comprehensive Education Acts in 1847, 1855, and 1857.[^26]

The Constitution of 1845, though conservative, tailored to reflect Moderate principles and strengthened the power of the monarchy and the Church, nonetheless represented an important step in Spain's constitutional development.[^27] Under this framework, Spain became a confessional state with re-established subsidies for worship and clergy, and the Church gained favored presence in education, serving as the first step toward reconciliation between Church and State, formalized in the Concordat of 1851.[^28]

### Economic and Infrastructure Development

Isabella's reign marked a period of significant modernization and economic progress for Spain. The expansion of railways and the telegraph transformed communications and commerce.[^29] The General Railway Act and the General Disentailment Act, both passed in 1855, were landmark pieces of legislation aimed at consolidating the middle class and promoting economic development.[^30] The main legislative work of the Progressive Biennium (1854-1856) focused on economic reforms, including Madoz's disentailment, which transferred ecclesiastical and municipal properties to private ownership.[^31]

Infrastructure development accelerated under Isabella's reign. Madrid and Barcelona began their growth into major modern cities, with the first electric lighting tests conducted, photography spreading throughout society, and the creation of the public water supply company Canal Isabel II in 1851.[^32] The founding of the Bank of Spain in 1856 provided a modern financial institution crucial for economic development, while the country's industries and mines received significant boosts.[^33]

### Cultural and Educational Achievements

The period witnessed remarkable cultural advancement. The Royal Theatre in Madrid was inaugurated in 1850, becoming a center of Spanish cultural life.[^34] The Prado Museum collections expanded in 1865, enhancing Spain's cultural patrimony.[^35] Educational centers of different levels were founded throughout the country, and on April 21, 1866, Queen Isabella laid the foundation stone for the current headquarters of the National Library of Spain.[^36]

### Military and Foreign Policy Successes

The later part of Isabella's reign saw Spain achieve a significant military victory in the War against Morocco (1859-1860).[^37] General Leopoldo O'Donnell encouraged this "prestigious" foreign policy, with Queen Isabella personally present in Tetouan on January 1, 1860, encouraging her troops.[^38] The conflict ended in the Treaty of Wad-Ras, which was advantageous for Spain, securing the extension in perpetuity of Spanish presence in Ceuta and Melilla, the end of tribal raids on those cities, recognition of Spanish sovereignty over the Chafarinas Islands, and Spanish administration over Tétouan until substantial reparations were paid.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Isabella II's reign was plagued by scandals, corruption, and political failures that ultimately led to her downfall. Her personal conduct and political decisions severely damaged the monarchy's prestige and contributed to growing opposition across the political spectrum.

### Personal Scandals and Marital Discord

Isabella's marriage to her cousin Francisco de Asís de Borbón, Duke of Cádiz, arranged on October 10, 1846 when she was just sixteen, proved catastrophic for her reputation.[^40] The marriage was arranged against her will after France and England vetoed German and French princes who had sought the Queen's hand.[^41] Isabella reportedly found her marriage disgusting and was utterly repulsed by her husband, allegedly saying about her wedding night: "What shall I tell you about a man whom I saw wearing more lace than I was wearing on our wedding night?"[^42]

In 1847, a major scandal erupted when Isabella, age seventeen, publicly showed her love for General Francisco Serrano and her willingness to divorce her husband, causing severe deterioration of the queen's public image.[^43] Serrano was merely the first of numerous men who became romantically entangled with Isabella, whose sexual appetites became legendary.[^44] Her personal conduct and recurrent rumors of extramarital affairs severely damaged her reputation.[^45]

Persistent rumors suggested that few if any of Isabella's children were fathered by her King Consort, who was rumored to be homosexual and suffered from hypospadias, a malformation of the urethra.[^46] The Carlist party asserted that the heir-apparent, who later became Alfonso XII, had been fathered by a captain of the guard, Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans.[^47] Other lovers reportedly fathered her other children, with Miguel Tenorio de Castilla, a politician and the Queen's longtime secretary, seeming to have been the father of three of her daughters.[^48] Francisco de Asís recognized all the children but proceeded to blackmail the queen, receiving money in exchange for keeping silent about the paternity questions.[^49]

### Political Failures and Corruption

Isabella became increasingly unpopular because of her tendency to involve herself in politics in unprincipled ways, showing favoritism toward her conservative generals and the religious orders that held sway in her court.[^50] Never a good judge of character, she became the unwitting pawn of many corrupt and dissolute courtiers.[^51] Her government was plagued by corruption, economic crises, and political repression, and she had alienated liberals and progressives while becoming increasingly dependent on conservative and clerical factions.[^52]

Historian Raymond Carr identified Isabella's "greatest political mistake" as "her refusal to admit the Progressives to power," which "tested their dynastic loyalty too hard and drove them to revolution."[^53] Her continual vacillation between liberal and conservative quarters had, by 1868, outraged the moderates, the progressives, and the members of the Unión Liberal, with opposition developing across party lines.[^54] Isabella's failure to respond to growing demands for a more progressive regime, combined with her questionable private life and political irresponsibility, contributed to the decline in monarchical strength and prestige.[^55]

### Economic Crisis and Final Collapse

The erosion of Isabella's authoritarian monarchical regime was aggravated by a deep economic crisis and bad harvests in 1867-1868.[^56] Scandalous reports on her private conduct, as she lived apart from her husband, along with her arbitrary political interference, further damaged the monarchical cause.[^57] Liberals and republican exiles made agreements at Ostend in 1866 and Brussels in 1867, laying the framework for a major uprising to overthrow Isabella, whom they increasingly saw as the source of Spain's difficulties.[^58]

## Personal Life

Isabella II's personal life was marked by tragedy, scandal, and eventual reconciliation with her estranged family. Her arranged marriage, numerous pregnancies, and complex romantic relationships shaped both her personal experience and public reputation.

### Marriage and Children

Isabella married her cousin Francisco de Asís de Borbón on October 10, 1846, in an arranged union that proved deeply unhappy from the outset.[^59] Despite the marital discord, Isabella endured twelve pregnancies throughout her life, though only five of her children survived into adulthood.[^60] Seven of her children died in infancy or were stillborn, including Luis Fernando (stillborn May 1849), Fernando Francisco (died five minutes after birth in July 1850), María Cristina (lived only two days in January 1854), Margarita (lived one day in September 1855, born prematurely), Francisco de Asís Fernando (stillborn December 1856), and María de la Concepción (died at nearly two years old in October 1861).[^61]

Her five surviving children were: María Isabel (1851-1931), who married Prince Gaetan, Count of Girgenti; Alfonso XII (1857-1885), who became King of Spain; María del Pilar (1861-1879); María de la Paz (1862-1946), who married Prince Louis Ferdinand of Bavaria; and María Eulalia (1864-1958), who married her cousin Infante Antonio d'Orléans, Duke of Galliera.[^62]

### Romantic Relationships

Beyond her unhappy marriage, Isabella maintained several romantic relationships throughout her reign. General Francisco Serrano was the first of her lovers, though he was described as ambitious and cold, allegedly revealing to the public the true nature of Isabella's marriage.[^63] A young officer, José Ruíz de Arana, was probably the father of her first surviving child; their liaison lasted until late 1856, and he was reportedly the first who truly loved her rather than using the relationship to enhance his career.[^64] After 1875, during her exile, she lived in a relationship with Ramiro de la Puente y González Nandín, her secretary and chief of staff.[^65]

### Later Life and Reconciliation

Isabella separated from her husband in March 1870 and continued to live in France after the restoration of the monarchy in 1874.[^66] Ironically, during her exile she grew closer to her estranged husband, with whom she maintained an ambiguous friendship until his death in 1902.[^67] She mostly lived in Paris at the Palacio Castilla, returning to Spain briefly in July 1876, staying in Santander and El Escorial before leaving for France again in 1877.[^68] Her later life was described as "monotonous and uneventful," occasionally visiting Spain but generally remaining in France.[^69]

Isabella died on April 9, 1904, at 8:45 AM, succumbing to influenza at age 73.[^70] Her corpse was moved from the Palacio Castilla to the Gare d'Orsay, arrived at El Escorial on April 15, and her funeral took place the next day at San Francisco el Grande, with final burial at El Escorial, the traditional resting place for Spanish monarchs.[^71]

## Legacy

Isabella II's legacy remains deeply contested, embodying the contradictions of Spain's turbulent transition from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. Her reign left an indelible mark on Spanish history, though historians and the Spanish public continue to debate whether her impact was ultimately positive or destructive.

### Modernization Despite Instability

The reign of Isabella II has been recognized as essential to the modern history of Spain, witnessing significant modernization despite persistent political turmoil.[^72] The expansion of railways and telegraphs, the growth of Madrid and Barcelona, the first electric lighting tests, the spread of photography, the creation of Canal Isabel II in 1851, the founding of the Bank of Spain in 1856, and boosts to industry and mining were all achievements of this period.[^73] During the "Isabelline Era," the consolidation of the constitutional regime continued with the promulgation of the Constitutions of 1837 and 1845, alongside measures promoting a liberal political, social, and economic model.[^74]

However, this modernization occurred within a context of severe political instability. As one historian noted, Isabella's reign "was greatly influenced by the personality of Queen Isabella, who had no gifts for government and was under constant pressure from the Court, especially from her own mother, and also from Generals Ramón María Narváez, Baldomero Espartero and Leopoldo O'Donnell, which prevented the transition from the Old Regime to the Liberal State from being consolidated."[^75] Spain consequently reached the last third of the 19th century in unfavorable conditions compared to other European powers.[^76]

### Constitutional Development and Failure

Isabella's reign saw important constitutional developments, establishing parliamentary institutions and liberal principles that would shape Spain's future political development.[^77] The Constitution of 1837 restored progressive features of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and entrenched the concepts of constitutionalism, parliamentarism, and separation of powers in Spain.[^78] Yet the alternation between constitutions reflecting different political factions' interests—the progressive Constitution of 1837 and the conservative Constitution of 1845—revealed the instability and lack of consensus that characterized her reign.[^79]

### Paving the Way for Restoration

Despite being overthrown in the Revolution of 1868, Isabella's formal abdication in 1870 paved the way for the restoration of the throne in 1874 under her son Alfonso XII.[^80] The restoration ended the political instability of the First Spanish Republic and reinstated the Bourbon monarchy, with Alfonso XII's short reign giving rise to hopes for a stable constitutional monarchy.[^81] In this sense, Isabella's ultimate legacy was facilitating the transition to a more stable monarchical system under her son, even though she herself proved unable to provide such stability.

### Cultural and Institutional Contributions

The cultural achievements of Isabella's reign left lasting institutions that continued to serve Spain long after her deposition. The Royal Theatre, the expanded Prado Museum, the National Library headquarters, educational institutions, and infrastructure like Canal Isabel II remained important elements of Spanish society.[^82] These contributions to Spain's cultural and institutional development represent perhaps the most enduring positive aspects of her legacy.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some historians and defenders of Isabella II have emphasized the extraordinarily difficult circumstances she faced, ascending to the throne as an infant and assuming personal rule as a poorly educated thirteen-year-old.[^83] Her supporters view her as a queen who inherited an impossible situation and struggled to navigate the treacherous waters of Spanish politics during a period of fundamental transformation from absolutism to constitutional government.[^84]

Scholars have noted Isabella's personal qualities that contrasted with her public scandals. Despite causing scandal, she was reportedly generous and pious, with one author observing that "innumerable libels, songs, engravings, and every type of defamatory literature were produced; of her positive and real acts of virtue, abnegation, and generosity, little has been written."[^85] This suggests that the historical record may be unbalanced, focusing disproportionately on her failures and scandals while overlooking charitable and virtuous actions.

The modernization achievements of her reign—railways, telegraphs, banking institutions, educational reforms, and cultural developments—represent genuine progress that occurred under her monarchy, even if she cannot claim sole or even primary credit for these advances.[^86] Some defenders argue that the liberal politicians and military leaders who actually governed deserve blame for the corruption and instability, while Isabella was often a pawn manipulated by more powerful forces around her.[^87]

### Negative Views

Critics of Isabella II present a damning assessment of her reign and personal character. Historian Raymond Carr's judgment that her "refusal to admit the Progressives to power... tested their dynastic loyalty too hard and drove them to revolution" represents a scholarly consensus that her political partisanship was fundamentally destructive.[^88] As one scholar noted, "she was essentially illiterate and ignorant in basic fields of study, and like her father, was not very intelligent, making her by native intelligence and training ill-equipped to be a queen."[^89]

Her personal conduct severely damaged the monarchy's prestige and legitimacy. The scandals surrounding her marriage, her numerous extramarital affairs, and the questions about her children's paternity created a crisis of legitimacy that extended beyond her person to the institution of monarchy itself.[^90] Never a good judge of character, she became the unwitting pawn of corrupt and dissolute courtiers, with her government plagued by corruption, economic crises, and political repression.[^91]

Isabella's legacy, according to critics, is primarily one of missed opportunities and political failure. She "eventually prevailed and held the throne for a total of thirty-five years but contributed little but discord to her realm."[^92] Her inability to transcend partisan politics, combined with her personal scandals and lack of political acumen, meant that Spain's transition to constitutional monarchy occurred despite rather than because of her leadership.[^93] The ultimate verdict is captured in the assessment that "Isabella's failure to respond to growing demands for a more progressive regime, her questionable private life, and her political irresponsibility contributed to the decline in monarchical strength and prestige that led to her deposition in the Revolution of 1868."[^94]

For scholarly presentations of her reign, historians recommend Raymond Carr's "Spain, 1808-1939" (1966) for its comprehensive treatment of the economics and politics of the Isabelline period.[^95]
