## Summary

The "Battle of Los Angeles" (or "The Great Los Angeles Air Raid") is one of the most dramatic events in UFO history because it involved a full-scale military assault on an unknown object. In the early hours of February 25, 1942—just three months after Pearl Harbor—air raid sirens sounded across Los Angeles. 

For over an hour, the U.S. Army's 37th Coast Artillery Brigade fired more than **1,400 anti-aircraft shells** into the sky at a slow-moving, unidentifiable object. Searchlights converged on the craft, yet despite the intense barrage, no aircraft was shot down, and no wreckage was ever found. Five civilians died due to the chaos (car accidents and heart attacks). The event remains unexplained, with theories ranging from a Japanese air raid to a lost weather balloon or an extraterrestrial visitation.[^1]

## The Incident (Feb 24-25, 1942)

### The Alert
Tensions were high. A Japanese submarine (|*-17*) had shelled an oil refinery near Santa Barbara just two days prior.
*   **02:25 AM:** Air raid sirens sounded. A total blackout was ordered.
*   **03:16 AM:** The firing began. Coastal artillery batteries opened fire with .50 caliber machine guns and 12.8-pound anti-aircraft shells.

### The Barrage
Witnesses watched as searchlights scanned the sky and locked onto a target.
*   **The Object:** Reports described a large, round or lozenge-shaped object moving slowly from Santa Monica to Long Beach. It appeared glowing orange or red.
*   **The Fire:** 1,430 shells were fired. Shrapnel rained down on homes and streets, damaging buildings and vehicles.
*   **Invincibility:** Despite direct hits (witnesses claimed to see shells bursting taking hits on the object), the craft did not crash, did not drop bombs, and simply moved on.[^2]

### The "All Clear"
The firing ceased at 4:14 AM. The sun rose to reveal no enemy aircraft wreckage, only damaged American property.

## The Famous Photo

The *Los Angeles Times* published a photo on February 26, 1942, that became legendary.
*   **The Image:** It shows multiple searchlight beams converging on a single bright spot in the night sky, surrounded by explosions (flak bursts).
*   **UFO Proof?** To believers, the object in the center looks like a classic saucer.
*   **Retouching:** Skeptics point out that the published photo was heavily retouched (a common practice in newspapers of the 1940s) to boost contrast, which may have artificially created the "saucer" shape out of the glare of the converging lights.[^3]

## Explanations

### Official Confusion
Immediately after the raid:
*   **Secretary of the Navy (Frank Knox):** Called it a "false alarm" caused by "jittery nerves."
*   **Secretary of War (Henry Stimson):** Contradicted Knox, stating that at least 15 planes were involved.

### The Weather Balloon Theory (1983)
Decades later, the Office of Air Force History concluded the incident was triggered by a lost meteorological balloon.
*   **Scenario:** A balloon was launched at 1:00 AM. It was spotted, flares were fired, and the smoke from the flares/shells was mistaken for attacking aircraft in the adrenaline-fueled confusion ("war nerves").[^4]

### The Extraterrestrial Theory
Ufologists argue a weather balloon would have been destroyed instantly by 1,400 shells.
*   **Durability:** The fact that the object absorbed heavy fire for an hour without visibly sustaining damage suggests advanced shielding or non-material properties.
*   **Majestic 12:** Some conspiracy theories link this event to the retrieval of an alien craft, pre-dating Roswell, though no physical evidence supports this.[^5]
