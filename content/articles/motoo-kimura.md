## Summary

Motoo Kimura was a Japanese biologist who developed the neutral theory of molecular evolution, proposing that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random genetic drift rather than natural selection. His theory was initially controversial but is now widely accepted as explaining a significant portion of molecular evolution. He made fundamental contributions to population genetics mathematics.
