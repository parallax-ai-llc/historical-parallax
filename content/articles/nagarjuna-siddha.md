## Summary

Nagarjuna was the founder of the Madhyamaka school and one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in history. His Mulamadhyamakakarika deconstructed all metaphysical positions through his method of reductio ad absurdum, demonstrating the emptiness (sunyata) of all phenomena. He showed that emptiness itself is empty, avoiding both nihilism and eternalism. His philosophy became the foundation of Mahayana Buddhism.
