## Summary

Sir Edmund Percival Hillary was a New Zealand mountaineer, explorer, and philanthropist who, along with Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953. This achievement brought him international fame and made him a hero in New Zealand and beyond. Following his mountaineering career, Hillary dedicated much of his life to humanitarian work in Nepal, building schools, hospitals, and infrastructure for the Sherpa people. He also participated in expeditions to Antarctica and served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India. His legacy encompasses both his pioneering spirit in exploration and his lifelong commitment to improving the lives of mountain communities in the Himalayas.

## Early Life and Background

Edmund Percival Hillary was born on July 20, 1919, in Auckland, New Zealand, to Percival Augustus Hillary and Gertrude Hillary (née Clark). His father was a beekeeper, and the family moved to Tuakau, a small rural community south of Auckland, when Edmund was two years old. Growing up in the countryside, Hillary attended the small local school before transferring to Auckland Grammar School when he was 11, a daily commute that took several hours by train. This long journey left him feeling somewhat isolated from his peers, and he described himself as a shy and awkward teenager who found solace in reading adventure stories and dreaming of exploration.

Hillary's introduction to climbing came relatively late, at age 16, during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu in 1935. The experience of being in the mountains captivated him, and he discovered that he had both the physical stamina and mental determination for mountaineering. Despite his growing passion for climbing, Hillary's early adult life followed a more conventional path. He joined his father's beekeeping business, which would remain his primary occupation for many years, allowing him the seasonal flexibility to pursue climbing expeditions during the New Zealand winter when beekeeping was less demanding.

During World War II, Hillary served as a navigator in the Royal New Zealand Air Force in the Pacific theater. He was injured in a boat fire in 1945, which left him hospitalized for several months. After the war, he returned to beekeeping while intensifying his mountaineering activities, making numerous ascents in the New Zealand Alps. By the late 1940s, Hillary had become one of New Zealand's most accomplished climbers, known for his strength, determination, and systematic approach to mountaineering. His reputation grew within the climbing community, setting the stage for his selection for Himalayan expeditions that would change his life.

## Rise to Prominence

Hillary's path to international fame began with his first Himalayan expedition in 1951, when he was invited to join a New Zealand party exploring the Garhwal region. The following year, he participated in a British reconnaissance expedition to Cho Oyu, during which the team also explored approaches to Mount Everest. His performance on these expeditions impressed British expedition organizers, and he was invited to join the 1953 British Everest Expedition led by John Hunt. This invitation was partly due to the close relationship between Britain and New Zealand, but also reflected Hillary's proven abilities at high altitude and his reputation as a strong, reliable climber.

The 1953 Everest expedition was a large, well-funded military-style operation involving over 400 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and tons of supplies. The British had made several previous attempts on Everest, and there was enormous pressure to succeed before other nations, particularly the Swiss who had come very close in 1952. Hillary was paired with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who had already been on six Everest expeditions and was considered one of the most experienced high-altitude climbers in the world. The partnership proved to be ideal, combining Hillary's physical strength and technical climbing skills with Tenzing's experience and intimate knowledge of the mountain.

On May 29, 1953, after a grueling final climb from their high camp at 27,900 feet, Hillary and Tenzing reached the summit of Mount Everest at 11:30 AM. They spent about 15 minutes on top, during which Hillary took photographs and Tenzing left offerings of food as a Buddhist ceremony. The achievement was announced on June 2, 1953, coinciding with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and the timing created a perfect storm of publicity. Britain, still recovering from World War II and the loss of empire, celebrated the conquest of Everest as a symbol of British achievement, even though the successful climber was a New Zealand beekeeper.

The news made Hillary an instant international celebrity. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming Sir Edmund Hillary, and received numerous awards and honors from around the world. Initially overwhelmed by the attention, Hillary struggled with his newfound fame and the question of what to do next with his life. He had achieved at age 33 what many considered the ultimate mountaineering goal, and the world expected him to capitalize on his celebrity. However, Hillary's character and values would lead him down a different path than many expected, one focused on service rather than self-promotion.

## Major Achievements

While the conquest of Everest remains Hillary's most famous achievement, it was only the beginning of a remarkable career in exploration and humanitarian work. Between 1955 and 1958, Hillary participated in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, a British expedition led by Vivian Fuchs that aimed to cross Antarctica via the South Pole. Hillary led the New Zealand section of the expedition, which was responsible for laying supply depots from the Ross Sea side of Antarctica. In a controversial but celebrated move, Hillary drove his tractors to the South Pole itself, becoming the first person to reach the Pole overland since Robert Falcon Scott in 1912, though this was not part of his original assignment and created some tension with expedition leader Fuchs.

In the 1960s, Hillary turned increasingly toward humanitarian work in Nepal, the country that had been the setting for his greatest triumph. Beginning in 1961, he established the Himalayan Trust, which became the vehicle for his philanthropic efforts over the next four decades. The trust built schools, hospitals, clinics, bridges, and water pipelines in the remote Khumbu region of Nepal, home to the Sherpa people who had made Everest expeditions possible. Hillary personally fundraised for these projects through lectures, books, and by leveraging his celebrity status. He viewed this work as repaying a debt to the Sherpa people, and it became his life's most important mission.

By the time of his death, the Himalayan Trust had built 30 schools, 2 hospitals, and 12 medical clinics in Nepal. Hillary's commitment was personal and hands-on; he visited Nepal nearly every year for decades, overseeing projects and maintaining relationships with the communities he served. The schools educated thousands of Sherpa children who would otherwise have had no access to education, and the medical facilities provided healthcare in one of the most remote and challenging environments on Earth. This work transformed Hillary from a one-time hero into a sustained force for good, earning him deep respect and affection among the Nepalese people.

In addition to his humanitarian work, Hillary continued exploring well into his later years. He led expeditions to climb peaks in Antarctica, participated in a motorized expedition from the Antarctic coast to the South Pole (1967), and joined a jet boat expedition traveling up the Ganges River from the ocean to its source in the Himalayas (1977). He also served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India, Nepal, and Bangladesh from 1985 to 1989, representing his country diplomatically in the region where he had done so much of his life's work. Throughout his life, Hillary authored numerous books about his adventures and his work in Nepal, further spreading his message and raising funds for the Himalayan Trust.

## Controversies and Criticisms

One of the most enduring controversies surrounding Hillary's Everest achievement concerns who actually reached the summit first, Hillary or Tenzing Norgay. Initially, the expedition organizers announced that they had reached the summit "almost together," avoiding the question of precedence. However, intense media pressure, particularly from Indian and Nepalese journalists who saw Tenzing as a hero of Asian achievement, demanded clarification. Hillary maintained that he had reached the summit first, and Tenzing later confirmed this in his autobiography. Some critics accused Hillary of taking credit that should have been shared equally, though most historians accept that the question of "who was first" by a few feet is essentially meaningless and that both men should be equally credited.

Hillary's decision to drive his tractors to the South Pole during the Trans-Antarctic Expedition, while celebrated in New Zealand, created significant controversy within the expedition. Expedition leader Vivian Fuchs felt that Hillary had exceeded his role and potentially endangered the main crossing party by racing ahead to the Pole. Some British commentators accused Hillary of grandstanding and seeking personal glory rather than adhering to the expedition's plan. The incident revealed tensions between British expedition leadership and the more independent-minded New Zealand contingent, and it damaged Hillary's relationship with some members of the polar exploration community.

In his later years, Hillary became involved in a bitter controversy over the commercialization of Mount Everest. He was sharply critical of the modern guided expedition industry, arguing that it had turned Everest into a commodity where wealthy but inadequately experienced climbers could buy their way to the summit. After the 1996 Everest disaster, in which eight climbers died during a single storm, Hillary stated that the mountain had become "a disgusting mess" and that some of the climbers who died had no business being on Everest. While many agreed with his assessment, others felt that his criticism was elitist and failed to acknowledge that he himself had benefited from substantial logistical support and Sherpa assistance during his own climb.

Some critics of Hillary's humanitarian work argued that his school-building efforts, while well-intentioned, contributed to cultural erosion in Sherpa communities by introducing Western education and values. Anthropologists noted that Sherpa children educated in Hillary's schools often left their villages for urban areas, contributing to brain drain in remote communities. Others questioned whether Hillary's paternalistic approach to aid, driven by a Western do-gooder mentality, truly empowered local communities or simply created dependency. Hillary himself acknowledged some of these concerns in later years but maintained that education and healthcare were fundamental rights that should be available to all children, regardless of tradition or culture.

## Personal Life

Edmund Hillary married Louise Mary Rose in 1953, shortly after his Everest triumph. Louise, the daughter of the president of the New Zealand Alpine Club, shared Hillary's love of the mountains and understood the demands of his lifestyle. Together they had three children: Peter, Sarah, and Belinda. The family lived in Auckland, where Hillary maintained his beekeeping business for many years, though he was frequently away on expeditions and lecture tours. Louise often accompanied Hillary to Nepal and was actively involved in the Himalayan Trust's work, particularly in establishing schools and healthcare facilities.

Tragedy struck the Hillary family in 1975 when Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu while on their way to join Hillary in the Phaphlu region of Nepal. The loss devastated Hillary, who was waiting at the hospital when he received news of the crash. He fell into a deep depression and considered abandoning his work in Nepal entirely. However, friends and the Sherpa community convinced him to continue, arguing that Louise would have wanted the humanitarian work to go on. Many observers noted that Hillary's commitment to Nepal intensified after the tragedy, as if he were completing work that he and Louise had undertaken together.

In 1989, Hillary married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who had died on an Antarctic expedition in 1979. June had been a friend of the Hillary family for many years and understood the unique demands of Hillary's public life and continued commitments to Nepal. The marriage provided Hillary with companionship and support during his later years. Hillary was known for his modesty despite his fame, often expressing discomfort with excessive praise and maintaining that Tenzing Norgay deserved equal credit for the Everest climb. Friends described him as self-deprecating, with a dry sense of humor and a preference for action over words.

Hillary's personality was characterized by determination, practicality, and a strong sense of social justice. He was uncomfortable with the class distinctions that characterized British expeditions of his era and formed strong bonds with the Sherpa people based on mutual respect rather than the colonial-era hierarchies that some expeditions maintained. Despite his international fame, Hillary remained connected to his New Zealand roots and was regarded as embodying the country's egalitarian values. He was known for answering his own mail, often personally responding to letters from schoolchildren around the world. In his later years, he became increasingly outspoken on environmental issues and the need to preserve mountain wilderness areas.

## Legacy

Edmund Hillary's legacy extends far beyond his 15 minutes on the summit of Mount Everest. In New Zealand, he became a national icon, appearing on the country's five-dollar note and serving as a symbol of the Kiwi values of determination, humility, and service to others. His image adorned stamps, coins, and public buildings, and he received the country's highest honor, the Order of New Zealand, in 1987. When he died in 2008, New Zealand accorded him a state funeral, a rare honor that reflected his status as perhaps the most beloved figure in the nation's history.

In Nepal, Hillary is remembered not primarily as the first person to climb Everest but as a great friend and benefactor of the Nepalese people. The schools, hospitals, and infrastructure he built through the Himalayan Trust transformed life in the Khumbu region, providing opportunities for education and healthcare that had been entirely absent before his efforts. Several places in Nepal bear his name, and Sherpas speak of him with deep affection and gratitude. The Himalayan Trust continues to operate, carrying on Hillary's work under the leadership of his son Peter Hillary and other trustees, ensuring that his humanitarian legacy endures.

Hillary's approach to exploration and achievement has influenced generations of climbers and adventurers. His emphasis on using fame and accomplishment as a platform for service rather than self-aggrandizement set a model that many have sought to follow. Unlike some explorers who treated indigenous peoples merely as expedition support, Hillary recognized the Sherpas as equals and partners, building lasting relationships based on respect. This approach helped shift attitudes in the mountaineering community toward more ethical and equitable relationships with local communities in expedition areas.

The philosophical question Hillary raised—"What do you do after climbing the highest mountain?"—and his answer through decades of humanitarian work, has resonated widely beyond the mountaineering world. His life demonstrated that achievement is not an end in itself but potentially a beginning, a platform from which to contribute to others. Educational institutions, leadership programs, and humanitarian organizations have drawn inspiration from Hillary's example, using his life story to illustrate the importance of service and the responsible use of fame and resources.

However, Hillary's legacy is also complicated by the changing context of Himalayan mountaineering. The commercial expedition industry that he criticized has grown enormously since his death, with Everest now climbed by hundreds of people each year, many of questionable skill. Environmental degradation on the mountain, including the accumulation of tons of trash and human waste, represents a challenge that Hillary warned about but that has worsened since his death. Debates continue about whether Everest should be closed to commercial expeditions or more strictly regulated, with Hillary's criticisms of commercialization frequently cited by both sides.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and biographers have consistently praised Hillary's remarkable combination of physical achievement and humanitarian dedication. Michael Gill, who climbed with Hillary and later wrote about him, described Hillary as "the embodiment of the best of human nature—brave, humble, and committed to helping others." Academic assessments have highlighted how Hillary used his celebrity for constructive purposes at a time when many famous figures simply cashed in on their fame through endorsements and appearances. His decision to dedicate much of his life to building schools and hospitals in Nepal is often cited as a model of how public figures can leverage their prominence for social good.

Edmund Hillary's biographer Alexa Johnston noted that Hillary's achievement represented a particular moment when human determination and technological capability converged to accomplish something previously thought impossible. The meticulous planning, teamwork, and perseverance required for the 1953 Everest expedition represented the best of human organizational capability, and Hillary's role in that success demonstrated both individual excellence and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. Johnston and other scholars have emphasized that Hillary never sought to diminish Tenzing's role and consistently advocated for recognition of the entire expedition team's contributions.

Environmental historians have praised Hillary's later-life advocacy for mountain conservation and his warnings about the environmental impact of excessive tourism and expeditions. His statements about Everest becoming degraded by commercialization proved prescient, and conservation organizations have invoked his authority in campaigns to protect mountain environments. The Himalayan Trust's approach to development, which emphasized working with local communities and respecting local culture while providing education and healthcare, has been studied as a model of culturally sensitive development work.

Scholars of New Zealand history view Hillary as a figure who helped shape modern New Zealand identity. His egalitarianism, practical approach to problem-solving, and lack of pretension embodied what New Zealanders saw as their national character. Yet he achieved this while also gaining genuine international stature, proving that a small nation could produce individuals of world-historical importance. His later public advocacy on issues like environmental protection and social justice further cemented his role as a moral voice in New Zealand public life, transcending his original fame as a mountaineer.

## Historical Assessment (continued)

### Negative Views

Some critics have argued that Hillary's fame was disproportionate to his actual achievement, particularly given Tenzing Norgay's equal contribution to reaching the summit. Postcolonial scholars have examined how the narrative of Everest was shaped by British imperial interests and Western media dominance, which naturally elevated the white Commonwealth climber over the Asian Sherpa. Critics note that while Hillary acknowledged Tenzing's role, the structures of fame and recognition ensured that Hillary became far more internationally celebrated, received a knighthood, and became wealthy from lectures and book sales, while Tenzing received less recognition and far less financial benefit.

The controversy over who stepped on the summit first, which persisted for years despite both men's attempts to defuse it, has been criticized as revealing the ego and competitive spirit that Hillary claimed to transcend. Some accounts suggest that Hillary was more concerned with securing credit than he publicly admitted, and that the "humble beekeeper" persona was partly a construction that obscured a more complex and ambitious personality. His decision to race to the South Pole during the Trans-Antarctic Expedition, exceeding his assigned role, has been cited as evidence of a desire for personal glory that contradicted his modest public image.

Anthropological critics have questioned whether Hillary's humanitarian work in Nepal, despite its good intentions, represented a form of cultural imperialism. By building Western-style schools and introducing modern medicine, Hillary may have contributed to the erosion of traditional Sherpa culture and created dependencies that undermined local autonomy. Some scholars argue that the narrative of the "great white savior" bringing civilization to remote peoples is inherently problematic, regardless of the material benefits provided. The fact that Hillary, not the Sherpas themselves, controlled the Himalayan Trust and made decisions about priorities and projects has been cited as evidence of paternalism.

Critics of Hillary's later pronouncements on Everest commercialization argue that his position was hypocritical, given that his own expedition was a heavily funded, large-scale operation that employed numerous Sherpas in dangerous work for relatively low pay. The difference between the 1953 expedition and modern commercial expeditions is one of degree rather than kind, these critics argue, and Hillary's objections reflected nostalgia for an era when only elite climbers could afford Himalayan expeditions. His criticism that some climbers "have no business being on Everest" struck some as elitist and dismissive of the democratization of mountaineering that has allowed a wider range of people to pursue their dreams.
