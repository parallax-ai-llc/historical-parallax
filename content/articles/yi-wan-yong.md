## Summary

Yi Wan-yong (1858-1926) was a Korean politician and diplomat who served as Prime Minister of Korea during the final years of the Korean Empire and is one of the most controversial figures in Korean history. He is primarily remembered as the chief collaborator who signed the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, which resulted in the annexation of Korea by Japan and the end of Korean sovereignty for 35 years[^1]. Born into an aristocratic yangban family, Yi rose through the ranks of the Korean government during a tumultuous period of foreign intervention and internal reform movements[^2]. In contemporary Korea, he is widely regarded as the ultimate symbol of treason and collaboration, with his name synonymous with betrayal of the nation[^3]. His legacy remains deeply contentious, representing broader questions about collaboration, resistance, and national identity during periods of imperial conquest[^4].

---

## Early Life and Background

Yi Wan-yong was born on July 7, 1858, in Seoul (then Hanseong), during the late Joseon Dynasty, into a prominent yangban (aristocratic) family[^5]. His family belonged to the Jeonju Yi clan, which, while not directly related to the royal family, held considerable social status and connections within the Confucian bureaucratic system[^6]. Yi received a traditional Confucian education in his youth, studying the Chinese classics and preparing for the civil service examinations that were the pathway to government positions in Joseon Korea[^7].

During his formative years, Korea was experiencing increasing pressure from foreign powers, particularly Japan, China, and Western nations seeking to open the traditionally isolationist "Hermit Kingdom" to trade and diplomatic relations[^8]. The 1876 Treaty of Ganghwa, which forced Korea to open its ports to Japanese trade, occurred when Yi was a young man of eighteen, and this event would foreshadow the international pressures that would define his political career[^9].

Yi demonstrated exceptional academic ability and successfully passed the civil service examination in 1882, entering government service at the age of 24[^10]. His early career coincided with the brief period of progressive reform known as the Gapo Reform, during which Korea attempted to modernize its institutions along Western and Japanese lines[^11]. Yi quickly distinguished himself as an advocate for modernization and showed particular aptitude for diplomatic affairs[^12].

In 1887, Yi was appointed to serve in the Korean legation to the United States, marking the beginning of his diplomatic career[^13]. This experience abroad exposed him to Western political systems and reinforced his conviction that Korea needed to modernize rapidly to survive in an era of imperial competition[^14]. Upon returning to Korea, Yi continued to rise through the bureaucratic ranks, advocating for reforms while navigating the complex factional politics of the Korean court[^15].

---

## Rise to Power

Yi Wan-yong's political ascent accelerated during the tumultuous 1890s, a period marked by the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), which was fought partially on Korean soil and resulted in China's defeat and the weakening of Chinese influence over Korea[^16]. Following Japan's victory, Yi aligned himself with the pro-Japanese reform faction, believing that Japan represented the most viable model for Korean modernization and the best protection against Russian expansionism[^17].

During the Gabo Reform period (1894-1896), Yi served in various ministerial positions and was instrumental in implementing reforms to the legal system, administrative structure, and military organization[^18]. However, these reforms were deeply unpopular with conservative elements at court and were closely associated with Japanese influence, creating political liabilities for those involved[^19].

The assassination of Queen Min (later titled Empress Myeongseong) by Japanese agents in 1895 temporarily disrupted Yi's career, as King Gojong sought to distance himself from Japanese influence[^20]. However, Yi proved politically resilient, managing to maintain his position by carefully navigating between different factions and foreign powers[^21].

Following the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), in which Japan decisively defeated Russia, Yi recognized that Japan had become the dominant power in Korea and that Korean independence was increasingly untenable[^22]. He served as Minister of Education and later Minister of Foreign Affairs during this critical period[^23]. In 1906, Yi was appointed as Prime Minister under the Protectorate Government established by the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905, which had already stripped Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty[^24].

As Prime Minister, Yi became the most powerful Korean official under the Japanese protectorate, working closely with the Japanese Resident-General Itō Hirobumi[^25]. Yi argued that cooperation with Japan was the only realistic path available to Korea and that resistance would result only in bloodshed without achieving independence[^26]. This position made him increasingly unpopular with Korean nationalists, who viewed any collaboration with Japan as treason[^27].

## Major Achievements

From the perspective of administrative efficiency and modernization, Yi Wan-yong oversaw significant reforms to Korea's governmental structure during his time in power[^28]. He was instrumental in establishing modern educational institutions, including the founding of several schools that introduced Western curricula and scientific education to Korean students[^29]. These educational reforms, while occurring under Japanese oversight, did create a foundation for modern education in Korea that would continue after liberation[^30].

Yi played a key role in legal reforms that replaced traditional Joseon law codes with modern legal systems based on Japanese and Western models[^31]. These reforms included the establishment of modern courts, codification of civil and criminal law, and the introduction of concepts such as written contracts and property rights that aligned with international commercial practices[^32]. While these changes were implemented under Japanese direction, they represented a significant modernization of Korean legal infrastructure[^33].

As a diplomat, Yi successfully negotiated several agreements that, from his perspective, protected Korean interests within the constraints of Japanese dominance[^34]. He argued that without Korean officials like himself serving as intermediaries, Japan would have imposed even harsher terms on Korea[^35]. He negotiated provisions for Korean participation in the colonial administration and sought to preserve some degree of Korean cultural autonomy[^36].

Yi also supported infrastructure development, including the expansion of railway networks, modern postal services, and telegraph systems[^37]. While these projects primarily served Japanese economic and military interests, they did modernize Korea's infrastructure in ways that would prove valuable after independence[^38].

However, these "achievements" must be understood within the context of collaboration with an occupying power. Most historians view Yi's administrative accomplishments as fundamentally tainted by their service to Japanese imperialism rather than Korean independence[^39]. The modernization he facilitated came at the cost of national sovereignty and was designed to integrate Korea into the Japanese empire rather than to strengthen Korean autonomy[^40].

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Yi Wan-yong's most infamous act was signing the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910 on August 22, 1910, which formally annexed Korea to Japan and dissolved the Korean Empire[^41]. This treaty ended over 500 years of the Joseon Dynasty and more than a millennium of Korean independence[^42]. Yi signed the treaty as Prime Minister, along with seven other Korean officials who became known as the "Eulsa Ojeok" or "Five Traitors of 1905" (referring to an earlier treaty) and later expanded to include those involved in the 1910 annexation[^43].

The annexation treaty was signed despite widespread Korean opposition, including protests, petition movements, and armed resistance by righteous armies (Uibyeong) throughout the country[^44]. Many Korean officials refused to cooperate with the annexation, choosing resignation, exile, or suicide rather than participate in the dissolution of their nation[^45]. Yi's decision to sign the treaty was seen as the ultimate betrayal, and he became the primary symbol of pro-Japanese collaboration in Korean historical memory[^46].

Following the annexation, Yi received significant rewards from the Japanese government, including a title of nobility (Marquis), a substantial financial payment, and continued high-ranking positions in the colonial administration[^47]. These rewards further cemented his reputation as someone who had sold out his country for personal gain[^48]. Korean nationalists viewed Yi and other collaborators as having chosen wealth and status over national loyalty[^49].

Yi faced multiple assassination attempts by Korean independence activists. In 1909, independence fighter Lee Jae-myung attempted to assassinate Yi, stabbing him during a public event[^50]. Yi survived but was seriously wounded[^51]. This assassination attempt made Yi a target of nationalist anger and demonstrated the depth of popular opposition to his policies[^52].

During the March First Movement of 1919, a nationwide peaceful protest against Japanese rule, Yi's name was prominently featured on lists of "traitors to the nation" circulated by independence activists[^53]. The massive scale of the March First Movement, involving millions of Koreans, demonstrated that Yi's argument that annexation was accepted by the Korean people was false[^54].

Yi's collaboration extended beyond the annexation treaty itself. He actively worked to suppress Korean independence movements, supported Japanese policies of cultural assimilation, and helped implement systems that exploited Korean labor and resources for Japanese benefit[^55]. He publicly advocated for Koreans to embrace Japanese rule and argued against independence movements as futile and dangerous[^56].

---

## Personal Life

Yi Wan-yong married into another prominent yangban family, strengthening his social and political connections[^57]. He had several children who were educated in both Korean Confucian traditions and modern Japanese educational institutions[^58]. His family benefited significantly from his political position and wealth accumulated through collaboration with Japan[^59].

Contemporary accounts describe Yi as an intelligent and cultured man, well-versed in classical Chinese literature and poetry[^60]. He was known for his eloquence and persuasive speaking ability, which he used to advocate for his political positions[^61]. However, these same talents made him particularly effective as a collaborator and thus particularly reviled by Korean nationalists[^62].

Yi maintained close personal relationships with Japanese officials, including Resident-General Itō Hirobumi and later colonial governors[^63]. These relationships were characterized by Yi's apparent genuine belief in the necessity and benefits of Japanese rule, rather than mere opportunism, though the distinction was largely irrelevant to his critics[^64].

In his personal writings and statements, Yi consistently argued that he had acted in what he believed to be Korea's best interests, given the impossible international situation Korea faced[^65]. He maintained that Korea lacked the military power to resist Japan and that annexation was preferable to violent conquest and potential dismemberment of Korean territory among multiple imperial powers[^66].

During his final years, Yi lived in relative seclusion, protected by Japanese authorities from continued threats of assassination[^67]. He died on February 12, 1926, in Seoul, reportedly of natural causes related to old age and complications from his earlier stabbing injuries[^68]. Even his death was controversial, with some Korean nationalists expressing satisfaction that he had lived to see the continued resistance to Japanese rule[^69].

## Legacy

Yi Wan-yong's legacy in Korean historical memory is unambiguously negative. He is remembered as the archetypal traitor, and his name has become synonymous with betrayal in Korean culture[^70]. The term "Yi Wan-yong" is used as an epithet to describe anyone perceived as betraying their country or people for personal gain[^71].

In 2005, the South Korean government officially designated Yi as one of the "親日反民族行為者" (chinilbanminjok haengwija, or "Pro-Japanese Anti-National Actors"), a legal classification for individuals who collaborated with Japanese colonial rule[^72]. His descendants were required to return properties and wealth that had been granted to Yi by the Japanese government, though legal complications and the passage of time made full restitution difficult[^73].

Yi's grave became a site of controversy, with some Korean citizens vandalizing it or demanding its removal[^74]. The location and maintenance of his burial site remain contentious issues in contemporary South Korea[^75].

In Korean education, Yi is presented as a primary example of collaboration and national betrayal, featuring prominently in history textbooks as a negative historical figure[^76]. Students learn about Yi in the context of Japanese imperialism and the importance of national sovereignty and resistance to foreign domination[^77].

The historical treatment of Yi has influenced South Korean attitudes toward collaboration and national loyalty more broadly. His legacy has shaped how South Korea has dealt with other periods of foreign influence and collaboration, including debates about collaboration with North Korea, the United States, and other powers[^78].

Internationally, Yi is less well-known, but scholars of Korean history and colonialism recognize him as a significant case study in collaboration with imperial powers[^79]. His case raises complex questions about agency, choice, and moral responsibility under conditions of extreme power imbalance[^80].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Very few historians or commentators offer positive assessments of Yi Wan-yong, and those who attempt more nuanced views still acknowledge the fundamental problem of his collaboration with Japanese imperialism[^81]. Some scholars have argued that Yi's actions should be understood within the context of limited options available to Korean leaders facing overwhelming Japanese military and economic power[^82].

A minority of historians have suggested that Yi genuinely believed that annexation was the least harmful option for Korea, given the international situation of the early 20th century, and that his motivations were more complex than simple greed or ambition[^83]. These scholars point to Yi's earlier reform efforts and his consistent advocacy for modernization as evidence that he saw Japanese rule as a vehicle for transforming Korea into a modern state[^84].

Some accounts note that Yi attempted to negotiate provisions within the annexation treaty that would preserve some degree of Korean cultural autonomy and protect Korean interests within the colonial framework[^85]. These attempts, while ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the harsh realities of colonial rule, might indicate some degree of concern for Korean welfare within his fundamentally collaborationist position[^86].

A few scholars have argued that the historical focus on Yi Wan-yong as an individual traitor obscures the structural and systemic nature of Japanese imperialism, which would have proceeded with or without his cooperation[^87]. This perspective suggests that condemning individuals like Yi, while emotionally satisfying, may prevent deeper analysis of the mechanisms of imperial control[^88].

However, it is important to note that these more sympathetic or nuanced interpretations remain highly controversial and are rejected by the vast majority of Korean historians and the Korean public[^89]. Even scholars who offer such interpretations typically do not defend Yi's actions but rather seek to understand them within a broader historical context[^90].

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among Korean historians, independence activists, and the general Korean public is that Yi Wan-yong was a traitor who prioritized personal gain over national sovereignty[^91]. This view emphasizes that Yi had choices and that many other Korean officials chose resignation, exile, or resistance rather than collaboration[^92].

Critics point out that Yi's signing of the annexation treaty directly contradicted the wishes of the Korean people, who demonstrated through protests, petitions, and armed resistance that they opposed Japanese rule[^93]. The March First Movement of 1919, involving an estimated two million participants, clearly demonstrated that Koreans rejected the annexation that Yi had facilitated[^94].

Nationalist historians emphasize that Yi received substantial personal benefits from collaboration, including noble titles, financial rewards, and continued political power under colonial rule[^95]. These benefits undermine any claim that Yi acted purely from ideological conviction or concern for Korean welfare[^96].

Many scholars argue that Yi's collaboration actively harmed the Korean independence movement by providing legitimacy to Japanese rule and facilitating the implementation of colonial policies[^97]. His position as Prime Minister made him the most visible Korean face of collaboration, demoralizing resistance efforts and creating divisions within Korean society[^98].

Contemporary assessments emphasize that Yi's legacy continues to harm Korean society by serving as an example of collaboration that damages national unity and historical memory[^99]. The controversy surrounding his descendants and property restitution demonstrates that the wounds of collaboration remain unhealed even a century after the events[^100].

International scholars of colonialism generally view Yi as a case study in collaboration with imperial powers, comparing him to collaborators in other colonial contexts such as Vidkun Quisling in Norway or Wang Jingwei in China[^101]. These comparisons universally place Yi in the category of individuals who betrayed their nations for personal or ideological reasons[^102].
