## Summary

Karl von Frisch was an Austrian ethologist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries about honey bee communication. He decoded the waggle dance of bees, showing that they communicate the direction and distance of food sources through structured dances. This was one of the first demonstrations of symbolic communication in animals.
