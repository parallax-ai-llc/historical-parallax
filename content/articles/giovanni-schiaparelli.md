## Summary

Giovanni Schiaparelli was an Italian astronomer who is best known for his observations of Mars that included linear features he called 'canali' (channels). His term was mistranslated into English as 'canals,' sparking widespread speculation about intelligent life on Mars. He also established that meteor showers originate from comets and studied the rotation of Mercury and Venus. His Mars observations profoundly influenced science fiction and space exploration.
