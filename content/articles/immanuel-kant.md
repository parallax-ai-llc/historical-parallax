## Summary

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a German philosopher who is central to modern philosophy. His *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781) aimed to reconcile rationalism and empiricism, arguing that while knowledge begins with experience, the mind actively structures experience through innate categories. His moral philosophy, based on the "categorical imperative," holds that actions are moral only if their principles can be universalized. Kant's influence extends across epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. Never traveling more than 100 miles from Königsberg and renowned for his rigid daily routine, Kant nonetheless revolutionized philosophy and remains essential to understanding modernity.

## Major Works

### Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787)

**Central Question:** What can we know?

**Key Ideas:**
- **Synthetic a priori knowledge**: Some knowledge is both informative and independent of experience (mathematics, basic physics principles)
- **Categories of understanding**: Mind has innate structures (causality, space, time) that organize experience
- **Phenomena vs. noumena**: We know things as they appear (phenomena), not as they are in themselves (noumena)
- **Limits of reason**: Metaphysical questions (God, free will, immortality) cannot be answered by pure reason

**Impact:**
Revolutionary "Copernican turn"—knowledge shaped by mind, not just received passively.

### Critique of Practical Reason (1788)

**Central Question:** What should I do?

**Key Ideas:**
- **Categorical imperative**: Act only according to maxims you could will as universal laws
- **Moral autonomy**: Morality comes from reason, not external commands
- **Duty, not consequences**: Right action from duty, not desire for rewards

### Critique of Judgment (1790)

**Themes:**
- Aesthetics: Beauty, sublime
- Teleology: Purpose in nature
- Bridge between theoretical and practical reason

### Other Works

- *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785)
- *Metaphysics of Morals* (1797)
- *Perpetual Peace* (1795)—essay on international relations, federation of nations

## Key Concepts

### Categorical Imperative

Universal moral law:

1. **Formula of Universal Law:** "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
2. **Humanity Formula:** "Treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means."

### Phenomena/Noumena

- **Phenomena**: The world as we experience it (shaped by our minds)
- **Noumena**: "Things in themselves"—reality beyond experience, unknowable

### Transcendental Idealism

Time and space are forms of our perception, not features of independent reality. We can only know the phenomenal world.

### Autonomy

Moral agents give themselves laws through reason. Freedom = obeying self-given rational laws.

## Influence

**Philosophy:**
- German Idealism (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) responded to Kant
- Neo-Kantianism (late 19th century)
- Analytic and continental philosophy both engage Kant

**Ethics:**
- Deontological ethics (duty-based)
- Human rights theory
- Influenced Rawls's justice theory

**Politics:**
- *Perpetual Peace* influenced international law, League of Nations, UN
- Republican government, cosmopolitanism

**Science:**
- Philosophy of science, epistemology
- Relation of mind to experience

## Controversies

**Race:**
Kant wrote racist passages accepting racial hierarchy. Criticized by modern scholars.

**Women:**
Held conventional views of women's intellectual capacities.

**Difficulty:**
Notoriously difficult to read. "Critiques" are dense, technical.

## Death and Legacy

**Death:** February 12, 1804, Königsberg, age 79

**Last Words:** "Es ist gut" ("It is good")

**Legacy:**
- One of most influential philosophers ever
- Modern philosophy divided into pre-Kant and post-Kant
- Ethics, epistemology, aesthetics, political philosophy all transformed
- "You can be for or against him, but not without him"
