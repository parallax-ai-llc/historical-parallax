## Summary

Swami Abhishiktananda (Henri Le Saux) was a French Benedictine monk who went to India and became a pioneer of Hindu-Christian dialogue and practice. He combined Benedictine contemplative life with Hindu advaitic (non-dual) experience, spending years in caves at Arunachala. His diaries reveal a profound inner struggle to integrate two spiritual traditions. His works, including Saccidananda and The Secret of Arunachala, explore the meeting of Christianity and Advaita Vedanta.
