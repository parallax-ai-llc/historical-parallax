## Summary

Nachman of Breslov was a Hasidic rabbi and great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov who founded the Breslov Hasidic movement. He was unique among Hasidic leaders for his use of storytelling as a spiritual teaching method. His thirteen mystical fairy tales are literary masterpieces that operate on multiple levels of meaning. His famous teaching 'It is a great mitzvah to always be happy' encapsulates his spiritual approach. His followers never appointed a successor, considering him their eternal rebbe.
