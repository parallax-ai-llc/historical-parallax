## Summary

Peter Shor developed Shor's algorithm in 1994, which showed that a quantum computer could factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers, threatening all widely-used public-key cryptography. This result was one of the most important motivations for quantum computing research. He also developed quantum error correction codes.
