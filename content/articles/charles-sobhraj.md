## Summary
Charles Sobhraj, 'The Serpent,' preyed on Western tourists along Southeast Asia's hippie trail in the 1970s. He is believed to have murdered at least 12 people across Thailand, Nepal, India, and Malaysia. Convicted in Nepal in 2004, he was released in 2022 on health grounds and deported to France.

## Early Life
Born April 6, 1944, in Saigon, French Indochina, to a Vietnamese mother and Indian father. Adopted by a French army officer stepfather. He felt like an outsider in France and began petty crime as a teenager, serving multiple prison terms. [^1]

## Criminal Career
During the 1970s, Sobhraj traveled Southeast Asia befriending, drugging, robbing, and sometimes murdering Western tourists. His victims came from the US, Canada, Australia, France, and elsewhere. He stole passports to assume identities and operated with accomplices. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Caught drugging French tourists in New Delhi in 1976, he served 21 years in India's Tihar Jail. He returned to Nepal in 2003, was recognized, arrested, and convicted of two murders in 2004. Nepal's Supreme Court released him on health grounds in 2022. [^3]
