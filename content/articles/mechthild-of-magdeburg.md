## Summary

Mechthild of Magdeburg was a German mystic and writer whose The Flowing Light of the Godhead is one of the earliest and most important mystical texts in the German language. She lived as a Beguine (a lay religious woman) in Magdeburg before entering the Cistercian convent at Helfta. Her vivid, passionate descriptions of her mystical encounters with God combine erotic imagery with profound theological insight.
