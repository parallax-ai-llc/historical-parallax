## Overview

The Siege of Leningrad (September 8, 1941 – January 27, 1944) was the deadliest blockade in human history. Forces of Nazi Germany (Army Group North) and Finland severed all land connections to the city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). Hitler's order was precise: not to capture the city, but to "wipe it from the face of the earth" through starvation and shelling. For **872 days**, the city's 3 million inhabitants were trapped. Without heat, electricity, or food, civilians died by the thousands daily. Despite eating wallpaper paste, leather, and resorting to cannibalism, the city did not surrender.

## The Strategy

### Hitler's Directive No. 1601
"The Führer has decided to have the city of Leningrad wiped from the face of the earth... Requests for surrender negotiations shall be denied, since the problem of relocating and feeding the population cannot and should not be solved by us."
**Goal:** Genocide by starvation.

### The Blockade
- **North:** Finnish Army halted at the 1939 border (refused to attack city directly but held the line).
- **South/East:** German Army cut rail lines.
- **Water:** Only route left was Lake Ladoga.

## The Winter of Death (1941-1942)

### Rations
By November 1941, rations collapsed:
- **Manual Workers:** 250 grams bread/day.
- **Children/Elderly:** 125 grams bread/day (a single thin slice).
**The Bread:** 50% rye flour, 50% cellulose, sawdust, and cottonseed cake.

### Conditions
Temperatures fell to **-40°C**. No fuel for heating.
Water pipes froze. People drank from the contaminated Neva River.
**Death Rate:** In Jan 1942, ~100,000 people died *per month*.
Bodies were piled in streets, preserved by the cold.
**Cannibalism:**
NKVD records show 2,000+ arrests for cannibalism.
Gangs murdered people for ration cards.
Parents fed dead children to living children.

## The Road of Life (Doroga Zhizni)

When Lake Ladoga froze in November, Soviet engineers built an ice road.
**The Function:**
- Trucks brought flour *in*.
- Trucks took civilians (children/women) *out*.
**Danger:**
German Stuka bombers attacked the ice. Trucks often fell through weak ice. Drivers drove with doors open to jump out if sinking.
Despite this, it kept the city barely alive.

## Military Operations

### Operation Iskra (Spark) - Jan 1943
Soviet offensive finally pierced a narrow land corridor (10km wide) to the city.
Allowed a train line ("Victory Railway") to be built.
Siege technically broken, but bombardment continued.

### Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive - Jan 1944
Full lifting of the siege. Germans driven back 100km.

## Casualties (Estimates)

| Group | Deaths | Cause |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Civilians** | 632,000 - 1,000,000+ | Starvation/Cold |
| **Civilians** | ~17,000 | Shelling/Bombing |
| **Red Army** | ~1,000,000 | Defense/Relief attempts |
| **Evacuation** | ~1,400,000 | Evacuated (many died in transit) |

*More civilians died in Leningrad alone than the combined military deaths of the US and UK in the entire war.*

## Cultural Resistance

### Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 ("Leningrad")
