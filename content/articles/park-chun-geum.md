## Summary

Park Chun-geum (박춘금, 朴春琴, 1891-1973) was a controversial Korean politician and gangster who became the first and only Korean to serve as a member of the Japanese Imperial Diet's House of Representatives during the colonial period. Born into poverty in Gyeongsangnam-do, he rose from manual labor to organize the Sangaehoe (Mutual Love Association), a violent pro-Japanese organization that terrorized Korean labor activists in Japan. Elected to the Japanese Diet in 1932, 1940, and 1942, Park actively suppressed Korean independence movements and promoted Japanese colonial policies, including advocating for Korean military conscription and complete assimilation into the Japanese empire. After Korea's liberation, he fled to Japan where he lived until his death, officially designated as a pro-Japanese collaborator by the South Korean government.

## Early Life and Background

Park Chun-geum was born on April 17, 1891, in Samun-dong, Milyang, Gyeongsangnam Province, into an impoverished family.[^1][^2] His childhood was marked by severe poverty and limited educational opportunities. Park attended a traditional Korean seodang (서당) where he learned basic Chinese characters, but his formal education was minimal, and he was essentially self-taught.[^3] Despite having read the Thousand Character Classic (천자문), historical records describe him as largely uneducated.[^4]

In 1905, at the age of fourteen, Park left his hometown and found work as a servant (급사) at a military camp in Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do.[^5] This early experience exposed him to hierarchical organizational structures that would later influence his approach to gang organization. The extreme poverty of his youth and the limited opportunities available to Koreans during the early colonial period drove him to seek better prospects abroad.

In August 1908, at the age of seventeen, Park Chun-geum left Korea for Japan with virtually no money.[^6] He arrived in Japan during a period of increasing Korean migration, as many Koreans sought economic opportunities in the rapidly industrializing Japanese empire. Park worked a series of grueling manual labor jobs in Tokyo, Kobe, and other cities, including positions as a hired laborer, bicycle technician, coal mine worker, and construction worker.[^7] These experiences in Japan's underbelly exposed him to organized crime networks and taught him survival skills that would later define his career.

By 1917, Park had established himself in Nagoya, where he operated a Korean ginseng sales business.[^8] His entrepreneurial success and growing influence within the Korean community led to his appointment as chairman of the Nagoya Korean Association in May 1917.[^9] This position marked his transition from manual laborer to community leader, though his methods would soon reveal a willingness to use violence and collaboration with Japanese authorities to advance his interests.

## Rise to Power

Park Chun-geum's ascent to political prominence began with his creation of organized crime networks that served Japanese colonial interests. In 1920, he collaborated with politicians Lee Ki-dong and others to establish the Sanguhoe (相救會, Mutual Rescue Association) in Tokyo, an organization ostensibly created to help Korean workers based on principles of "mutual love" (相愛) and "coexistence and co-prosperity" (共存共榮), while promoting Japan-Korea unity (日鮮融和).[^10][^11] Park initially served as vice-chairman under Lee Ki-dong, but the organization was restructured in December 1921 as the Sangaehoe (相愛會, Mutual Love Association), with Park assuming greater control.[^12]

The Sangaehoe's stated mission was to provide job placement, personal counseling, and communal lodging for Korean laborers in Japan.[^13] However, in reality, it functioned as a violent extortion and control organization funded and supported by Japanese police authorities and the Government-General of Korea, who wanted to suppress Korean labor activism and advertise the "success" of colonization.[^14] Park used the organization to terrorize Korean labor activists working in Japan, mobilizing gangsters to break up labor disputes, tenant farmer disputes, and anti-Japanese movements.[^15] The Sangaehoe extorted 20-30% of the wages from teenage Korean female workers, earning Park the title "originator of knife terrorism and union destruction."[^16]

With help from Japanese politicians, Park expanded the Sangaehoe throughout Japan, and by the mid-1920s, the organization's membership reportedly reached over 100,000.[^17] In 1924, he organized the "Labor Sangaehoe" in Korea as a branch organization.[^18] His willingness to use violence against fellow Koreans on behalf of Japanese interests was demonstrated dramatically in April 1924, when the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper criticized Park and other pro-Japanese organizations. In retaliation, Park lured Dong-A Ilbo president Song Jin-woo and owner Kim Seong-su to a restaurant called Sikdowon, where he threatened them with a pistol, physically assaulted them, and poured filth on them.[^19][^20] This incident forced the collective resignation of the Dong-A Ilbo executive staff, though Kim Seong-su later returned as president in October 1924.[^21]

Park's collaboration with Japanese authorities intensified during the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1923, when false rumors led to the massacre of thousands of Koreans by Japanese vigilantes and police. Rather than protecting his fellow Koreans, Park organized a "labor service unit" of 300 Korean workers and, under the direction of Police Commissioner Akaike, engaged in corpse disposal and the tracking and detention of Korean workers.[^22][^23] This collaboration during one of the darkest moments for Koreans in Japan solidified his reputation as a devoted servant of Japanese colonial interests.

## Major Achievements

Park Chun-geum's most significant "achievement" in the eyes of Japanese colonial authorities was becoming the first Korean elected to the Japanese Imperial Diet. In February 1932, he ran as an independent candidate in the 18th House of Representatives election in Tokyo's 4th district, which encompassed Honjo-ku and Fukagawa-ku.[^24][^25] His campaign received substantial financial support from the Government-General of Korea, which wanted to showcase the "success" of colonial assimilation policies.[^26] Park also benefited from strong support from interest groups that exploited loopholes in the general election system.[^27]

Despite there being only 1,236 Korean voters in his district, Park received an impressive 6,966 votes, indicating significant support from Japanese voters.[^28] This electoral success demonstrated that Park's message of colonial assimilation resonated with certain Japanese constituencies. He was elected and served as an Imperial Diet member from 1932 to 1936.[^29] His election was unprecedented—Park became the first and only Korean-born person to serve as a member of the Japanese Imperial Diet's House of Representatives.[^30]

During his time in the Diet, Park made numerous speeches and proposals that attracted attention from his fellow representatives. He repeatedly questioned whether the government intended to grant suffrage to Koreans in Korea and whether Japan planned to increase military divisions stationed in Korea.[^31] Between 1932 and 1936, he made several demands for the implementation of parliamentary elections and the volunteer soldier system in Korea.[^32] However, his arguments were not based on Korean interests or democratic principles; rather, he framed these proposals as necessary for the complete "Japanization" of Korea and the strengthening of the empire.[^33]

Park lost his seat in the 1936 election but successfully ran again in 1940, winning election to the Diet for a second time.[^34] He was re-elected once more in 1942, though some sources indicate he lost this final election.[^35][^36] During the final stages of the Pacific War, Park organized the Yamato Alliance (大和同盟, Daeua Dongmaeng) with the goal of establishing a "decisive victory system" and promoting naisen-ittai (內鮮一體, Japan-Korea unity).[^37][^38] He served as a director of this organization and hosted "Time of Crisis Overcoming Grand Lecture" meetings to promote the spirit of certain victory and mobilize support for Japan's war effort.[^39]

On July 24, 1945, just twenty days before Korea's liberation, Park hosted the Asia People's Rally at the Bumin Hall in Gyeongseong (Seoul), proclaiming the Five Races Under One Union of Japan-China-Manchuria-Korea(-Mongolia).[^40] This event, organized by the Daeui Party led by Park, represented one of the final manifestations of his pro-Japanese Pan-Asianism ideology.[^41]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Park Chun-geum's entire career was defined by actions that directly harmed the Korean independence movement and exploited his fellow Koreans for personal gain. His organization, the Sangaehoe, systematically terrorized Korean labor activists, breaking strikes and union organizing efforts on behalf of Japanese business owners.[^42] The extortion of 20-30% of wages from teenage Korean female workers—some as young as their early teens—represents one of the most exploitative aspects of his activities.[^43]

In July 1924, during the Haeui Island tenant dispute, Park had Sangaehoe members attack the farmers' youth association, demonstrating his willingness to use violence against Korean farmers fighting for their rights.[^44] His assault on prominent Korean nationalist leaders Song Jin-woo and Kim Seong-su in April 1924 was a direct attack on one of Korea's most important nationalist newspapers and represented an attempt to silence criticism of pro-Japanese collaborators.[^45]

Park's role during the Great Kanto Earthquake is particularly controversial. While thousands of Koreans were being massacred based on false rumors, Park organized Korean workers not to protect their community but to assist Japanese authorities in "tracking and detaining" Korean workers.[^46] Academic research by Kim In-deok notes that Park and the Sangaehoe maintained pro-Japanese positions even during this tragic period of mass Korean casualties.[^47]

His activities in the Japanese Imperial Diet further demonstrated his anti-Korean stance. While he advocated for Korean voting rights and military service, scholars note that these arguments served the interests of Japanese settlers who had become wealthy in colonial Korea and Korean elites, not the interests of Koreans in general.[^48] His advocacy for Korean military conscription effectively promoted the forced mobilization of Koreans to fight for Japan during World War II.[^49]

After Korea's liberation in August 1945, the Committee for the Disposition of Anti-National Activities (반민특위) investigated Park's collaboration. In January 1949, the committee issued an arrest warrant for Park, and in July 1949, he was designated as a "Class 1 suspect of anti-national activities."[^50] However, Park had already fled to Japan, where the new South Korean government could not reach him, particularly after President Syngman Rhee dissolved the anti-collaborator committee.[^51]

## Personal Life

Despite his violent public career, Park Chun-geum maintained a relatively private personal life. He married and had at least one daughter, Park Seong-rye (박성례), who was born on October 2, 1925.[^52] Park's family remained connected to both Korea and Japan throughout his life, reflecting the transnational nature of his activities during the colonial period.

Park never underwent sōshi-kaimei (創氏改名), the Japanese name-change policy implemented in 1940.[^53] He maintained his Korean name throughout the colonial period, though it was read in Japanese pronunciation as "Boku Shunkin" (ボク・シュンキン) during his activities in Japan.[^54] Ironically, the 2005 manga "Kenkanryu" (혐한류, "Hating the Korean Wave") later cited Park, along with Army Lieutenant General Hong Sa-ik, as examples to deny the forced nature of name-change policies, claiming many people served in public positions with Korean names.[^55]

Historians have characterized Park as a "악랄한 동시에 순진한 친일파" (vicious yet naive pro-Japanese collaborator) who genuinely believed in Pan-Asianism and the Five Races Under One Union (오족협화) ideology.[^56][^57] This suggests that Park's collaboration stemmed not merely from opportunism but from a sincere, if deeply misguided, belief in Japanese imperial ideology. His commitment to these ideals persisted even as Japan's empire collapsed around him in 1945.

After Korea's liberation and his flight to Japan, Park lived out the remainder of his life in Tokyo. He served as president of Asia Corporation, a business based in Tokyo.[^58] Park Chun-geum died on March 31, 1973, at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo at the age of 81.[^59] His body was returned to Korea and buried in his family cemetery in Milyang.

## Legacy

Park Chun-geum's legacy in Korea is unambiguously negative. He is remembered as one of the most notorious pro-Japanese collaborators, someone who not only failed to support Korean independence but actively worked to suppress it through violence and political collaboration. The South Korean government has officially condemned his actions through multiple mechanisms.

In 2002, Park was included in a list of 708 pro-Japanese collaborators.[^60] In 2007, the Truth Commission on Forced Mobilization announced a list of 195 pro-Japanese anti-national acts, which included Park.[^61] Most significantly, in 2009, the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities (민족문제연구소) included Park in the Dictionary of Pro-Japanese Collaborators (친일인명사전), a comprehensive three-volume work documenting 4,389 individuals who collaborated with Japanese colonial rule.[^62][^63] Park was specifically categorized among the 11 Japanese Imperial Diet members in the dictionary.[^64]

Following liberation, his daughter Park Seong-rye erected a memorial monument (송덕비) at his grave site in Milyang's Gyodong area in 1992.[^65] However, once citizens of Milyang learned about the monument honoring a pro-Japanese collaborator, they protested, and the monument was subsequently removed and demolished.[^66] This incident reflects broader South Korean society's condemnation of Park's actions.

The issue of Park's property and wealth has remained contentious. Under the "Special Act on Property Belonging to Pro-Japanese Anti-National Collaborators" (친일반민족행위자 재산의 국가귀속에 관한 특별법), enacted to confiscate assets accumulated through colonial collaboration, Park's properties should have been seized by the state.[^67] However, much of his wealth was transferred to his descendants before confiscation could occur.

In January 2018, two plots of land (1,269㎡) in Milyang's Gyodong area that Park had purchased in 1926 were sold to a third party by his descendants.[^68] The land, which had passed to his daughter Park Seong-rye in 1989 and then to a great-grandchild in 2002, contained Park's tomb and memorial monument.[^69] Additionally, Park's daughter owned land worth over 10 billion won in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, which was gifted to three descendants and then sold to a third party in 2018.[^70] Among the four descendants who received and sold these properties, two were Japanese nationals residing in Tokyo at the time of sale.[^71] This pattern of descendants selling off inherited property before state confiscation could occur has been a source of ongoing controversy.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Very few scholars or commentators have offered positive assessments of Park Chun-geum. The limited defenses of Park typically come from Japanese nationalists rather than serious historians. Some Japanese sources have characterized Park as a "nationalist" who demanded the abolition of discrimination against Koreans, such as removing restrictions on imports of Korean rice and allowing voting rights in Korea.[^72] From this perspective, Park is presented as evidence of a working institutional democracy under the Japanese colonial empire and a successful case of "colonial assimilation."[^73]

A 2013 academic article by Lee Hyoung-sik examined Park as a case study in Japanese colonial assimilation policy, noting that Japanese authorities initially viewed Park as proof that colonial assimilation could succeed.[^74] However, Lee's analysis ultimately concluded that Park's case actually demonstrated the failure of colonial assimilation ideology, as his demands served only a narrow class of Japanese settlers and wealthy Koreans, not the broader Korean population.[^75]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among Korean historians and the broader public is that Park Chun-geum was one of the most malicious pro-Japanese collaborators. Academic research describes him as someone who "terrorized Korean labor activists working in Japan and extorted 20-30% of wages from teenage female workers," earning the designation "originator of knife terrorism and union destruction."[^76][^77]

The Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, which compiled the comprehensive Dictionary of Pro-Japanese Collaborators, categorized Park among the most serious cases of collaboration.[^78] Contemporary Korean historical scholarship emphasizes that Park's election to the Japanese Diet resulted not from genuine democratic participation but from "strong support of interest groups who exploited loopholes in general elections" and funding from the Government-General of Korea seeking to advertise colonization's "success."[^79]

Scholars note that the failure to properly punish collaborators like Park after liberation represents "one of the most painful moments in modern Korean history," as corruption, political-business collusion, and authoritarian culture originating from collaborators continued to harm South Korea's development.[^80] The fact that Park escaped justice by fleeing to Japan and lived comfortably until 1973 while independence activists suffered is seen as a profound injustice.[^81]
