## Summary

Halil Turgut Özal was a Turkish politician, economist, and engineer who served as the eighth President of Turkey from 1989 to 1993 and Prime Minister from 1983 to 1989. He is credited with transforming Turkey's economy through radical neo-liberal reforms, liberalizing trade, and opening the country to global markets. Özal's impact on modern Turkey has been compared to that of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, making him one of the most influential and controversial figures in the Turkish Republic's history.[^1][^2] His sudden death in 1993 remains shrouded in mystery, with later investigations suggesting possible poisoning.[^3]

---

## Early Life and Background

Halil Turgut Özal was born on October 13, 1927, in Malatya, a city in eastern Turkey, into a modest provincial family.[^4] He was the eldest of three sons born to Mehmet Sıddık Özal, who had trained as an imam before becoming a branch manager at the state-owned Agricultural Bank, and Hafize Özal, an elementary school teacher of Kurdish descent from Çemişgezek, Tunceli.[^5][^6] His parents were described as devout Muslims, with his mother being particularly influential in the family and associated with the İskenderpaşa community, affiliated with the Naqshbandi Sufi order.[^7]

Hafize Özal constantly emphasized the importance of education as the way to overcome the family's poverty, instilling in her sons a drive for academic excellence.[^8] Young Turgut completed his elementary education in Silifke, middle school in Mardin, and high school in Kayseri, demonstrating exceptional academic ability throughout his schooling.[^9] After completing his secondary education with honors, Özal enrolled at Istanbul Technical University in 1946 to study electrical engineering, graduating in 1950.[^10]

Between 1950 and 1952, Özal worked at the State Electrical Power Planning Administration before continuing his studies in the United States, where he focused on electrical energy and engineering management between 1952 and 1953.[^11] This early exposure to American economic thinking and technical expertise would profoundly shape his later political and economic philosophy. During the 1970s, Özal worked as an economist for the World Bank in the United States between 1971 and 1973, gaining invaluable experience with international financial institutions that would later inform his economic reforms.[^12] He also worked for various private companies during the mid-1970s, including Sabanci Holding, one of Turkey's largest conglomerates.[^13]

---

## Rise to Power

Özal's political ascent began in earnest in 1979 when he became undersecretary to Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel's minority government.[^14] In this role, he played a major part in developing economic reforms known as the January 24, 1980 decisions, which paved the way for greater neo-liberalism in the Turkish economy.[^15] These decisions, drafted "in consultation" with the International Monetary Fund, represented a fundamental shift from Turkey's previous import-substitution industrialization strategy toward an export-oriented, market-adjusted economic approach.[^16]

The January 24 decisions announced by the Demirel government included comprehensive measures: devaluation of the Turkish lira and institution of flexible exchange rates, maintenance of positive real interest rates, tight control of money supply and credit, elimination of most subsidies, freeing of prices charged by state enterprises, reform of the tax system, and encouragement of foreign investment.[^17] The IMF's enthusiastic support for these reforms was demonstrated when it released funds equivalent to 625 percent of Turkey's IMF quota in June 1980, the highest multiple ever granted to a country up to that time.[^18]

When the military staged a coup d'état on September 12, 1980, led by Chief of the General Staff General Kenan Evren, Özal's expertise was deemed indispensable.[^19] He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and minister responsible for economy and finance in the military-formed government headed by retired Admiral Bülend Ulusu.[^20] During this period from 1980 to 1983, Özal continued implementing his economic reforms under military protection, successfully reducing inflation from over 100 percent to under 40 percent within a year.[^21][^22]

As Turkey prepared to return to civilian rule, Özal founded the Motherland Party (Anavatan Partisi, ANAP) on May 20, 1983.[^23] The party was positioned as a centrist coalition that synthesized elements of Turkish nationalism, social conservatism, and economic liberalism, attempting to transcend the ideological divisions that had plagued Turkish politics before the coup.[^24] In the November 6, 1983 general elections, ANAP won an absolute majority with 45.1% of valid votes and 212 of 400 parliamentary seats, making Özal Prime Minister.[^25]

## Major Achievements

### Economic Transformation

Turgut Özal's most significant legacy lies in his radical transformation of Turkey's economy. He successfully transitioned Turkey from an import-substitution model to an export-promotion model with declining state intervention and more liberal policies.[^26] His free-market instincts defined his greatest achievements, particularly the opening up of the Turkish economy through the abolition of capital controls, liberalization of the foreign exchange regime, and one of the most aggressive export-driven policies anywhere in post-war history.[^27]

The results were dramatic: merchandise exports grew from $2.3 billion in 1979 to $8.3 billion in 1985, while import growth in the same period—from $4.8 billion to $11.2 billion—proportionately narrowed the trade deficit.[^28] Market-oriented reforms included trade liberalization, privatization of state enterprises, and incentives for foreign investment, contributing to annual GDP growth averaging around 5 percent during the late 1980s.[^29]

Özal's economic philosophy, which became known as "Özalism," combined neo-liberal and neo-conservative elements and represented Turkey's first expression of policies similar to Reaganism and Thatcherism.[^30] He argued that the state should be a guide rather than a regulatory actor in the economy, and that individuals should be entrepreneurs instead of relying on the state.[^31] His famous motto declared to President George H.W. Bush captured this philosophy: "Turkey wants more trade than aid."[^32]

### Foreign Policy Innovation

In foreign policy, Özal broke with decades of Turkish tradition by pursuing an activist agenda. He famously declared at a 1991 post-Gulf War press conference that Turkey "should leave its former passive and hesitant policies and engage in an active foreign policy."[^33] During the 1991 Gulf War, Özal maintained close relations with President George H.W. Bush and positioned Turkey as a bridge linking cultures and continents, telling Bush "I understand both" Eastern and Western thinking.[^34]

In joining the Gulf War coalition against Iraq, Turkey broke several long-standing taboos: it took sides in a Middle Eastern dispute and assumed a war-like posture on a Middle Eastern border for the first time since 1957.[^35] Özal was convinced that the Gulf War offered an opportunity to expand Turkey's political role and influence in regional affairs, gain political leverage with Washington regarding bilateral defense and trade issues, and increase trade opportunities in the Middle East.[^36] Bush acknowledged Turkey's unique position, telling Özal "Only you, with your relationships, could have talked to Rafsanjani [the Iranian president]."[^37]

### European Integration Efforts

On April 14, 1987, Prime Minister Özal formally submitted Turkey's application for full membership in the European Economic Community, creating a "shock effect" at the EU side.[^38] For Özal, the EC was important both politically and economically; he saw Turkey's integration into the EC as a continuation of Turkey's westernization and wanted EC membership to complement Turkey's newly liberalized market.[^39] He realized that relations with the EC were "dying" and needed "shock therapy," and that Greek membership with its accompanying veto powers had put Turkey in a disadvantaged position.[^40]

### Kurdish Language Reform

In a historic move in 1991, President Özal, who was himself of partial Kurdish origin, lifted Law No. 2932 to permit publishing in Kurdish, marking a major shift in Turkish policy toward its Kurdish minority.[^41] He told a meeting of Turkish editors that he was the first leader in Turkey to "break the taboo and call the Kurds, Kurds," and that the time had come to change attitudes toward the Kurds and "carry out reforms" respecting their human rights.[^42] While broadcasting in Kurdish remained illegal until 2002, this reform allowed Kurds to speak and publish in their native language for the first time in decades.[^43]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Human Rights Violations

Critics claimed that Özal behaved like an autocrat and tolerated human-rights violations during his time in office, particularly toward the end of the 1980s when his popularity began to decline.[^44] Despite his reforms on Kurdish language rights, significant restrictions remained: Kurdish could not be used in banners and leaflets at public demonstrations, in public offices and courts, or in schools.[^45] Özal categorically ruled out granting Kurds any kind of autonomy, and the Kurdish insurgency continued throughout his tenure.[^46]

### Economic Problems and Scandals

While Özal's economic reforms produced growth, they also generated persistent problems. He was never able to control galloping inflation throughout his tenure, with chronic inflation remaining a serious source of disequilibrium.[^47] His engineering mindset led him to conceive of inflation "as a cost of economic growth," which critics argued failed to see price stability as necessary for sustained growth.[^48] Unemployment rose significantly, with the official unemployment figure reaching 18.2 percent of an 18 million strong labor force in 1982, up from 15.4 percent in 1980.[^49]

In 1982, Özal and his colleague Kaya Erdem were forced to resign following the "Bankers' scandal," in which thousands of middle-class savers lost money based on promises of incredibly high interest rates.[^50] This incident temporarily derailed his political career and damaged his reputation for economic competence.

### Association with Military Regime

Özal's close collaboration with the military regime following the 1980 coup remains controversial. Some see him as a great reformer who liberalized Turkey's economy and political system, while others view him as having handed Turkey to neo-liberal forces with the help of a military regime.[^51] The World Bank and IMF's enthusiastic support for policies developed by the military leaders and Özal raised questions about external influence on Turkish sovereignty.[^52]

### Gulf War Controversy

Despite being President, Özal could not convince the opposition parties, public opinion, or military elites to go to war with the United States against Iraq, although he longed to be involved.[^53] He broke with state tradition by excluding bureaucracy, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from key decisions.[^54] His unilateral approach to foreign policy created tensions with Turkey's established institutions and democratic norms.

---

## Personal Life

Turgut Özal married Semra Yeğinmen in 1954, his second marriage to his secretary.[^55] Semra Özal (born January 12, 1934) was described as the driving force behind her husband's rise to power, playing a significant role in his political career.[^56] The couple had three children: Ahmet Özal (born 1955), Zeynep Özal (born 1956), and Efe Özal (born 1967).[^57]

Ahmet Özal followed his father into politics and was elected to parliament after the elections of 1999, though he did not continue after the 2002 elections.[^58] Efe Özal stayed out of politics and became a businessman, while Zeynep Özal maintained a lower public profile.[^59] The Özal family remained influential in Turkish political and business circles even after Turgut's death.

Özal's personality was marked by his pragmatic, entrepreneurial approach to governance and his ability to bridge different worlds. His background combined traditional religious values from his family with modern technical education and international experience. He was known for his informal style and willingness to challenge established bureaucratic norms. His mother's Kurdish heritage gave him personal insight into Turkey's ethnic complexities, though this connection was downplayed during much of his political career.

---

## Legacy

By the time of his death in 1993, Turkey's economy and society had been transformed almost beyond recognition.[^60] Özal is remembered as the most influential politician in the republic founded from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, second only to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[^61] According to former U.S. ambassador Morton I. Abramowitz, Özal "helped change his country like no one since Ataturk."[^62]

His vision and political philosophy have inspired a new generation of Turkish leaders, including President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has explicitly cited Özal as an influence.[^63] Özal's famous declaration—"The state should serve the people. People are not meant to serve the state"—summarized his main political philosophy and represented a fundamental break with Turkey's statist traditions.[^64]

Turkey's integration into the world financial system and opening to financial flows from Western countries during the Turgut Özal era fundamentally altered the country's economic structure.[^65] Under his tenure, Turkey saw a liberal transformation and economic boom as Özal championed free enterprise and increases in exports and imports, turning around a stalled economy.[^66] The World Bank and IMF frequently singled out Turkey in the mid-1980s as a case of successful adjustment.[^67]

However, his legacy remains contested. An adequate account encompasses multiple dimensions of his influence not only on the economic realm but also the transformations that Turkey went through in politics, culture, and foreign policy initiatives in the post-1980 era.[^68] His decisive influence in areas ranging from economic policy to the Kurdish question has generated a large literature examining his complex legacy.[^69]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic scholars have characterized Özal as "arguably the most influential political leader in Turkey since the time of Kemal Atatürk," recognizing his critical role in Turkey's transition to a neo-liberal development model in the 1980s.[^70] Scholar Feride Acar characterizes him as a "Pious Agent of Liberal Transformation," acknowledging his unique synthesis of liberal politics and economics with conservative values.[^71]

Supporters credit Özal with successfully implementing a liberal-conservative understanding in Turkey that balanced modernization with respect for traditional values.[^72] The World Bank steadily supported his regime through loans of close to one billion dollars per year, and international institutions such as the OECD, IMF, and World Bank viewed his stabilization-cum-structural adjustment program as highly credible and successful.[^73]

Özal's proponents argue that he demonstrated visionary leadership in breaking Turkey's diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation. His willingness to challenge long-standing taboos—whether in economic policy, foreign relations, or the Kurdish question—showed political courage that transformed Turkish society. His pragmatic approach to governance and his famous motto about crisis management reflects this optimistic view: "The only thing not to do in a crisis situation is to remain in the status quo. Up to the present every crisis has ultimately served as a springboard for progress."[^74]

### Negative Views

Critics view Özal's economic legacy through a much darker lens, arguing that Turkish neo-liberalism in critical perspective reveals serious flaws in his approach.[^75] His inability to control inflation and his conception of it as merely "a cost of economic growth" demonstrated fundamental economic mismanagement.[^76] The high unemployment rates and the Bankers' scandal of 1982 showed the human costs of his economic experimentation.[^77]

Conservative populists' attempts to portray Özal as a conscious defender of the "return of the authentic nation" have been challenged by scholars who see such claims as implausible misrepresentations.[^78] Critics argue that Özal's close collaboration with the military regime following the 1980 coup compromised his democratic credentials and that he essentially handed Turkey to neo-liberal forces under military protection.[^79]

His foreign policy activism, particularly regarding the Gulf War, is criticized as reckless adventurism that broke with Turkey's successful tradition of non-interference in Middle Eastern disputes without achieving concrete benefits.[^80] His autocratic tendencies and tolerance of human rights violations, particularly against Kurds despite his language reforms, revealed the limitations of his commitment to democratic values.[^81]
