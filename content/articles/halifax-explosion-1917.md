## Overview

On the morning of December 6, 1917, during the height of WWI, two ships collided in the harbor of Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was the **SS Mont-Blanc**, a French cargo ship packed to the brim with high explosives (TNT, picric acid, benzol) headed for the war in Europe. The resulting blast was approx. **2.9 kilotons**, making it the largest man-made explosion in human history prior to the atomic bomb. It flattened 2.5 square kilometers of the city, shattered windows 50 miles away, and created a tsunami that wiped out a Mi'kmaq community.

## The Collision

**The Narrows:** A tight strait connecting the harbor.
**SS Imo:** A Norwegian relief ship (empty) leaving the harbor.
**SS Mont-Blanc:** Entering the harbor, carrying 2,600 tons of explosives.
**The Signals:**
Due to miscommunication and stubbornness, the ships refused to yield right-of-way until it was too late.
They collided at slow speed (8:45 AM).
Sparks from the metal scraping ignited the barrels of benzol (airplane fuel) on the Mont-Blanc's deck.
The crew of the Mont-Blanc realized what was about to happen. They abandoned ship instantly, rowing for their lives to the Dartmouth shore, screaming warnings that no one understood (they were French).

## The Spectacle, Then The Flash

**The Fire (8:45 - 9:04 AM):**
A spectacle. The burning ship drifted toward the Halifax pier (Richmond district). Thick black smoke.
Crowds gathered at windows, on roofs, and on the street to watch the fire. Schoolchildren stopped on their way to class.
This curiosity is why the casualty rate was so high.

**The Explosion (9:04:35 AM):**
The ship vaporized.
*   **The Shockwave:** Traveled at 23 times the speed of sound. It leveled every building within an 800-meter radius.
*   **The Heat:** 5,000°C. Water around the ship instantly evaporated, exposing the harbor floor.
*   **The Shrapnel:** The Mont-Blanc's anchor shaft (1,140 lbs) was thrown **2.5 miles** away. A gun barrel landed 3.5 miles away.

## The Aftermath

**Blindness:**
Thousands of people were watching through glass windows. The shockwave shattered the glass inward.
Over **5,900 eye injuries** were treated. This event directly led to the founding of the **CNIB** (Canadian National Institute for the Blind).

**The Blizzard:**
To add misery to catastrophe, a massive blizzard struck the next day. Rescuers tried to dig survivors out of the rubble in -15°C snow. Many trapped survivors froze to death before they could be reached.

**Vincent Coleman:**
A railway dispatcher who realized the train from Saint John was due to arrive.
Instead of fleeing, he stayed at his post to tap a telegraph warning:
*"Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys."*
He died, but the train stopped safely. He saved ~300 lives.

## Legacy

**Boston's Christmas Tree:**
Boston sent a relief train immediately, arriving through the blizzard with doctors and supplies.
To this day, Nova Scotia sends a giant Christmas tree to Boston Common every year as a thank you.
