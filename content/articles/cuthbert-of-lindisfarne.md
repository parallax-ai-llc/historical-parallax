## Summary

Cuthbert of Lindisfarne was one of the most venerated saints in medieval England. He served as a monk, prior, and bishop of Lindisfarne, but spent years as a hermit on the Inner Farne Islands. He was known for his miracles, his austerity, and his deep communion with nature. His incorrupt body was discovered 11 years after his death and became one of the most important relics in England. His cult rivaled that of Thomas Becket.
