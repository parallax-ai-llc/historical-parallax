## Summary

John II of Portugal (1455-1495), posthumously known as "The Perfect Prince" (o Príncipe Perfeito), reigned as King of Portugal from 1481 until his death in 1495. He is regarded as one of the greatest Portuguese rulers for ruthlessly consolidating royal power, reinvigorating Portugal's economy, and advancing the Age of Exploration through groundbreaking maritime expeditions.[^1][^2] His reign witnessed the discovery of the Congo River and the historic rounding of the Cape of Good Hope, while he successfully negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas that divided the New World between Portugal and Spain.[^3][^4] Though celebrated for his political acumen and patronage of Renaissance learning, his treatment of the nobility and Jewish refugees earned him the contemporary reputation of a ruthless tyrant.[^5][^6]

## Early Life and Background

John was born in Lisbon on March 3, 1455, as the second son of King Afonso V of Portugal and Isabella of Coimbra.[^7] At just one month old, on June 25, 1455, he was declared legitimate heir to the crown and received an oath of allegiance from the three estates, securing his position in the line of succession despite being the second-born son.[^8] His mother, Queen Isabella, noted for her erudition in the humanities and deep piety, exerted a formative influence on his early development, promoting values of moral rectitude and cultural refinement amid the court's chivalric ethos.[^9]

John received a comprehensive humanist education befitting a future monarch, instructed by the leading scholars of the Portuguese court.[^10] His curriculum emphasized classical languages, and he achieved fluency in Latin alongside studies in sciences and arts, which cultivated a pragmatic intellect attuned to both scholarly pursuits and practical statecraft.[^11] This Renaissance education would later manifest in his patronage of learning and his keen interest in the scientific aspects of navigation and exploration.[^12]

At age sixteen, John accompanied his father on the conquest of Asilah in Morocco in 1471, where he fought in battle and was knighted by Afonso V immediately following the victory.[^13] This early military experience shaped the young prince's character, and contemporaries began dubbing him "the Perfect Prince" for his disciplined character emerging in youth.[^14] On January 22, 1471, shortly after the Moroccan campaign, the fifteen-year-old John married his twelve-year-old first cousin, Eleanor of Viseu, the eldest daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu, in an obvious marriage arranged for political advantage.[^15][^16]

In 1474, recognizing his son's growing capabilities, King Afonso V entrusted John with the "trade of Guinea" and supervision of Portugal's African explorations, giving the nineteen-year-old prince substantial responsibility over Portugal's overseas ventures.[^17] This early delegation of authority would prove crucial in shaping John's later policies as king and his unwavering commitment to exploration and maritime expansion.

## Rise to Power

John's path to the throne involved both military service and diplomatic maneuvering during a tumultuous period in Iberian politics. When the Castilian succession crisis erupted in 1474, John urged his father to marry Joanna la Beltraneja and invade Castile to secure her claim to the throne.[^18] On May 12, 1475, Afonso V appointed John as regent and the young prince mobilized an army of 5,600 cavalry and 14,000 foot soldiers to support his father's invasion of Castile.[^19]

The critical Battle of Toro occurred in March 1476, pitting approximately 8,000 Portuguese forces under Afonso V and Prince John against similar Castilian numbers led by Isabella's husband Ferdinand of Aragon, Cardinal Mendoza, and the Duke of Alba.[^20] King Afonso V was beaten by the left and center of Ferdinand's army and fled the battlefield, but John demonstrated remarkable military prowess by defeating the Castilian right wing, recovering the lost Portuguese Royal standard, and holding the field.[^21] Despite John's tactical success, the battle represented a great political victory for Isabella and Ferdinand, and Afonso's prospects for obtaining the Castilian crown were severely damaged.[^22]

While Afonso V departed for France in a fruitless search for an alliance, John defended the Portuguese frontier and parried Spanish counterattacks, demonstrating his capacity for leadership under pressure.[^23] In January 1476, John appointed his wife Eleanor regent of the kingdom, showing the trust he placed in her political abilities during his military campaigns.[^24] John played a major role in negotiating the Treaty of Alcáçovas (1479) with Spain, which concluded the War of the Castilian Succession and ensured Portuguese hegemony in the Atlantic south of the Canary Islands.[^25] The treaty also arranged for the marriage of John's future son, Afonso, to the eldest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella.[^26]

Alfonso V briefly abdicated his throne to John in September 1477, and from 1477 to 1481, father and son were "practically corulers."[^27] Following Afonso V's death on August 28, 1481, John was proclaimed King of Portugal and crowned at Sintra on August 31, 1481, at the age of twenty-six.[^28]

## Major Achievements

### Consolidation of Royal Authority

John II's most significant domestic achievement was the dramatic reassertion of royal power over the Portuguese nobility. After his official accession to the throne, John strived to diminish the power and influence of the feudal lords that had greatly accumulated during his father's reign.[^29] In November 1481, John summoned the Cortes (assembly) at Évora and imposed a drastic oath of obedience on his vassals, compelling magnates and subjects to swear allegiance to him as their unequivocal superior.[^30][^31]

The ceremony was perceived as humiliating by members of the upper nobility who were accustomed to the feudal tradition of acknowledging the king as simply first among equals.[^32] Each oath was recorded, signed, and witnessed, and at the conclusion, the royal orator spoke asserting that a subject's duty was "total obedience," describing the king as comparable to a Roman emperor or ancient Persian monarch.[^33] John further enraged nobles by declaring that property title deeds would undergo examination to ensure their validity, rather than being confirmed en masse.[^34]

John's ability to subdue the nobility later earned him recognition as "the perfect prince," a ruler who embodied the political qualities Niccolò Machiavelli described in _The Prince_.[^35] By successfully enriching the Crown through executing or exiling most of Portugal's feudal lords and confiscating their estates, John established a strong centralized monarchy that would serve Portugal well during the Age of Exploration.[^36]

### Advancement of Maritime Exploration

Like his great-uncle Prince Henry the Navigator, John II became deeply interested in the science of navigation and maritime exploration.[^37] Shortly after coming to power, he convened a group of expert mathematicians to establish a scientific method for determining latitude by observing the sun.[^38] In 1484, John appointed the Junta dos Mathematicos (Maritime Advisory Committee) to supervise navigational efforts and provide explorers with charts and instruments.[^39] This council included both local and foreign scholars such as João Afonso de Aveiro and German cosmographer Martin Behaim, creating a meritocratic system for governance and intellectual advancement.[^40][^41]

In 1483, Martin Behaim received an invitation to join John's council on navigation, led by the renowned astronomer Abraham Zacuto.[^42] The committee was tasked with finding improved methods for determining latitude, and in 1484, King John II dubbed Behaim with the honor of knighthood in the Portuguese Order of Christ, recognizing his contributions to Portuguese navigation.[^43]

John's reign witnessed extraordinary achievements in exploration. In 1482, the foundation of the coastal fortress and trade post of São Jorge da Mina (Elmina) in West Africa secured Portugal's gold trade.[^44] In 1484, navigator Diogo Cão discovered the Congo River and sailed down the coast of Angola to Cape Santa Maria, planting one of John's stone markers (padrões) to stake Portuguese claims.[^45][^46] On his second voyage, Cão sailed up the Congo River to the first rapids before continuing south as far as Cape Cross on the coast of what is now Namibia.[^47]

The crowning achievement came in 1488 when Bartolomeu Dias, following John's orders to find the southern limit of Africa, became the first European navigator to round the southern tip of Africa and demonstrate that the most effective southward route for ships lay in the open ocean, well west of the African coast.[^48][^49] Dias returned to Portugal in December 1488 with news that transformed European understanding of world geography.[^50] These discoveries laid the groundwork for Vasco da Gama's 1497 expedition to India, which Dias helped prepare by supervising construction of the voyage's vessels.[^51]

### Diplomatic Triumphs and the Treaty of Tordesillas

When Christopher Columbus arrived in Lisbon in 1493 with news of his discoveries, Pope Alexander VI awarded these new lands to the Spanish crown.[^52] John II immediately protested and began negotiations that led to the celebrated Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 7, 1494.[^53] John II was dissatisfied with the Pope's initial arrangement because Portugal's rights in the New World were insufficiently affirmed, and the Portuguese would not have sufficient room at sea for their African voyages.[^54]

Meeting at Tordesillas in northwestern Spain, Portuguese and Spanish ambassadors engaged in complex diplomatic negotiations.[^55] The treaty moved the demarcation line from the Pope's original proposal to 370 leagues (approximately 2,100 kilometers or 1,300 miles) west of the Cape Verde Islands, representing a significant shift that better served Portuguese interests.[^56][^57] This new boundary enabled Portugal to claim the coast of Brazil after its discovery by Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500.[^58] João II's skillful negotiation of this treaty demonstrated his diplomatic acumen and secured Portugal's claim to vast territories in the New World.[^59]

### Economic and Cultural Achievements

John II's economic policies, combined with profits derived from overseas explorations and expansion, resulted in Portugal having the soundest currency in Europe during his reign.[^60] He fixed Portugal's financial problems by creating a special council where members were chosen based on their skills and talents rather than their family names, establishing a meritocratic approach to governance.[^61]

In 1492, John II founded the Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos (All Saints Royal Hospital) in Lisbon, the most modern medical facility in the world at the time.[^62][^63] The first stone was laid by the king himself, creating the first central hospital established by the Portuguese Crown through the merger of around fifty small urban medieval hospitals.[^64] The hospital operated around the clock and housed seven hundred patients in twenty wards—twelve for men (five for medicine and seven for surgery) and eight for women (four for medicine and four for surgery).[^65] This Renaissance-inspired construction became a symbol of royal power and urbanity.[^66]

John was an astute politician and statesman as well as a patron of Renaissance art and learning.[^67] The Italian scholar Poliziano wrote a letter to John II paying him profound homage, considering his achievements more meritorious than those of Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar, and offered to write an epic work about John's accomplishments in navigation and conquests, to which the king replied positively in a letter dated October 23, 1491.[^68]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Brutal Suppression of Noble Conspiracies

John II's consolidation of power came at a terrible human cost that earned him the contemporary reputation of a ruthless tyrant. The Duke of Viseu and the Duke of Braganza, resentful of the humiliating oath ceremony and the king's assertion of absolute authority, began conspiring against John.[^69] The Duke of Braganza sent letters to Queen Isabella I of Castile asking her to intervene, but these letters and other correspondence by the conspiring families were intercepted by the king's extensive spy network.[^70]

In 1483, John responded with shocking brutality, having Fernando, Duke of Braganza, arrested, tried, and convicted of twenty-two counts of treason, then publicly beheaded in June of that year.[^71] Afterwards, the assets of the House of Braganza were confiscated and the family fled to Castile.[^72] When Diogo, Duke of Viseu—John's own cousin—was accused of being the center of another conspiracy in 1484, the king personally stabbed him to death.[^73] These actions, while consolidating John's authority, earned him considerable infamy and demonstrated the ruthless pragmatism that subordinated aristocratic factions to royal will.[^74]

Today John is known as "The Perfect Prince," however during his time as king, he was known as "The Tyrant" by many of his contemporaries.[^75]

### The Rejection of Christopher Columbus

Around 1484, Christopher Columbus first brought his "enterprise of the Indies" to the attention of King John II, who was initially excited by the idea.[^76] However, John submitted Columbus's proposal to his committee of experts, who rejected it on sound scientific reasoning.[^77] The committee believed that Eratosthenes's ancient estimate of an Earth nearly twenty-five thousand miles in circumference was correct, and they argued that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of 2,400 nautical miles was about four times too low—which was accurate.[^78][^79]

The Portuguese scholars rejected Pierre d'Ailly's underestimation of the Atlantic Ocean's size and Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli's exaggerated estimation of Asia's size as misguided.[^80] Additionally, the committee noted that Portugal was already developing a route to the Orient around the southern tip of Africa and did not want to waste resources on a questionable westward route.[^81] In 1488, Columbus again appealed to John II, but that meeting proved unsuccessful partly because Bartolomeu Dias had just returned with news of successfully rounding the southern tip of Africa.[^82]

Ironically, the committee members held the more accurate view of East Asia's location and its distance from Europe, but by being scientifically correct, their decision prevented Portugal from becoming the first European state to access the as-yet-unforeseen riches of the Americas.[^83]

### Treatment of Jewish Refugees

John II's treatment of Jewish refugees fleeing the Spanish Expulsion of 1492 reveals the most troubling aspect of his character. When approximately 120,000 Spanish Jews fled to Portugal in 1492, John saw an opportunity for profit as Portugal was waging a military campaign against Muslims in Africa.[^84] He convinced his advisory council to charge Jews eight cruzados per person for a temporary entrance permit good for eight months, arguing this could cover military expenses without overburdening local taxpayers.[^85][^86] Those unable to pay were immediately sold into slavery.[^87]

At the end of the eight-month asylum period, only 600 families of affluent Jews would be permitted to remain at a cost of 100 cruzados per household, along with certain skilled craftsmen and artisans.[^88] After eight months, the Portuguese government decreed the enslavement of all Jews who had not yet left the country.[^89] In 1493, in one of the most horrific acts of his reign, King John deported several hundred Jewish children to the newly discovered colony of São Tomé, where many perished.[^90]

While the king's personal attitude towards Portuguese Jews has been described as pragmatic—he valued their economic contributions and defended them against unjust harassment—his ruthless exploitation of the desperate Spanish refugees stands in stark contrast.[^91] In Jewish historiography, the ruthlessness of King João II has earned him considerable infamy, giving him the reputation of a callous tyrant who pitilessly persecuted the Jews, resorting to cruel methods to extort funds from Castilian Jews and coercing many to convert to Christianity.[^92]

## Personal Life

John married Eleanor of Viseu on January 22, 1471, when he was only fifteen and she was only twelve, in a political marriage to his first cousin.[^93] Despite the arranged nature of their union, John demonstrated trust in Eleanor's abilities by appointing her regent of the kingdom in January 1476 during his military campaigns.[^94] Eleanor gave birth to the couple's only child to survive infancy, Prince Afonso, in May 1475.[^95] The prince was named in honor of his grandfather and was central to John's dynastic plans.[^96]

The Treaty of Alcáçovas (1479) arranged for Prince Afonso's marriage to the eldest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella, securing an alliance between Portugal and Spain.[^97] However, tragedy struck in July 1491 when Prince Afonso died in a horse-riding accident, confronting Portugal with a succession crisis and devastating John personally.[^98][^99]

John had an illegitimate son by Ana de Mendonça, Jorge de Lencastre (1481-1550), Duke of Coimbra, who would become founder of the Lencastre family.[^100] Left with only his bastard son after Prince Afonso's death, John petitioned Pope Alexander VI for recognition of Jorge as the legitimate heir to the throne.[^101] However, this maneuver was strongly resisted by Queen Eleanor, who defended the rights of her brother Manuel, the new Duke of Beja and Viseu and legal heir presumptive.[^102] With the Spanish Alexander VI occupying the papal throne, John's chances of legitimizing Jorge were slight.[^103]

Following bitter disputes with Eleanor and under intense pressure from his Franciscan confessor, Queen Eleanor, and Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, John accepted the inevitability of Manuel's succession.[^104] Finally, while on his deathbed in September 1495, John recognized Manuel as his heir in his will.[^105] The succession dispute reveals the depth of John's personal loss and his desperate attempt to secure the throne for his own bloodline, even if through an illegitimate son.

John never enjoyed robust health and suffered from considerable stress throughout his reign.[^106] His personality combined remarkable intelligence and strategic thinking with ruthless pragmatism.[^107] He convened expert councils based on merit rather than birth, demonstrating his commitment to effective governance over traditional privilege.[^108]

## Legacy

John II died of dropsy (edema, likely caused by heart or kidney disease) at Alvor in the province of Algarve on October 25, 1495, at the age of forty.[^109][^110] After the ratification of the Tordesillas treaty, he felt unwell and, suspecting poisoning by aristocratic opponents, traveled south to Monchique to take the waters before moving to Alvor, where he died within a week of falling ill.[^111][^112] He was initially interred at Silves Cathedral, but his remains were transferred to the Monastery of Batalha in 1499.[^113] Tragically, his tomb at Batalha is now empty, as Napoleonic soldiers under Marshal Masséna threw away the bones during the French invasion.[^114]

John II is remembered primarily for consolidating royal power in Portugal and is regarded as one of the greatest Portuguese rulers.[^115] Some historians consider him the "greatest" monarch in Portuguese history.[^116] The posthumous nickname "the Perfect Prince" was intended to refer to Niccolò Machiavelli's work _The Prince_, as John II is considered to have lived his life exactly according to the writer's idea of a perfect prince.[^117]

His impact on Portuguese exploration was transformative. John restored the policies of Atlantic exploration, reviving and broadening the work of his great-uncle Henry the Navigator.[^118] The discoveries during his reign—the Congo River, the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope, and the foundation of strategic trading posts—laid the essential groundwork for Portugal's maritime empire.[^119] Vasco da Gama's successful voyage to India in 1498, just three years after John's death, was the direct result of John's systematic investment in navigation science and exploration.[^120]

Economically, John left Portugal with the soundest currency in Europe and established meritocratic governance institutions that would serve the nation well in subsequent decades.[^121] His foundation of All Saints Hospital demonstrated his commitment to public welfare and Renaissance ideals of civic improvement.[^122] To the Portuguese, he was a much-loved regent who curbed the power of the nobles, maintained peace with Spain through skillful diplomacy, and became a great patron of Renaissance art.[^123]

However, John's legacy is deeply complicated by his ruthlessness. His willingness to personally murder his own cousin, to execute nobles without hesitation, and to exploit desperate Jewish refugees reveals a ruler who subordinated all moral considerations to raison d'état.[^124] The contemporary epithet "The Tyrant" was not unearned, even if later Portuguese historiography has emphasized his achievements over his cruelties.[^125]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Portuguese historiography has given John II a consistently positive posthumous reputation, celebrating him as the monarch who transformed Portugal into a centralized state capable of building a global empire.[^126] Modern historians recognize that his era's peace resulted from his ruthless pragmatism, which successfully subordinated aristocratic factions to royal will and prevented the kind of noble conflicts that plagued other European kingdoms.[^127]

Scholars credit John with reinvigorating the economy of Portugal and renewing Portuguese exploration of Africa and Asia at a critical juncture when momentum might have been lost after Prince Henry's death.[^128] His establishment of the Junta dos Mathematicos and his patronage of scientific navigation represents an early modern approach to state-sponsored research and development that was decades ahead of most European monarchs.[^129]

The Italian humanist Poliziano's assessment—that John's achievements were more meritorious than those of Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar—reflects how contemporary Renaissance scholars viewed him as an exemplar of the new type of ruler who combined classical learning with practical statecraft.[^130] John's meritocratic councils, which selected members based on skills and talents rather than family names, demonstrated a progressive approach to governance that anticipated later Enlightenment ideals.[^131]

Military historians note that at the Battle of Toro, despite being only twenty-one years old, John demonstrated remarkable tactical abilities by defeating the Castilian right wing and recovering the Portuguese Royal standard after his father had fled the field.[^132] His diplomatic negotiation of both the Treaty of Alcáçovas and the Treaty of Tordesillas shows a sophistication in international relations that secured Portuguese interests for generations.[^133]

### Negative Views

Critics of John II emphasize that his methods were extraordinarily brutal even by the violent standards of the fifteenth century. The public execution of the Duke of Braganza and the personal murder of the Duke of Viseu—his own cousin—represent acts of ruthless violence that cannot be justified merely as political necessity.[^134] The fact that he was known as "The Tyrant" by his contemporaries suggests that many Portuguese subjects lived in fear of their king's violent impulses.[^135]

Jewish historiography provides the harshest assessment of John II, portraying him as a callous tyrant who pitilessly persecuted Jewish refugees in their moment of greatest vulnerability.[^136] The enslavement of those who could not pay his extortionate fees, the forced conversions to Christianity, and especially the deportation of hundreds of Jewish children to São Tomé where many died, represent acts of cruelty that stain his historical reputation.[^137] Scholars note that while John may have valued the economic contributions of Portuguese Jews, his treatment of Spanish Jewish refugees was driven purely by greed and showed complete disregard for human suffering.[^138]

The rejection of Christopher Columbus, while scientifically sound, ultimately represents a massive strategic blunder that cost Portugal the opportunity to claim the Americas.[^139] Some historians argue that John's commitment to the eastern route around Africa, though ultimately successful, reflected an inability to hedge strategic bets or to consider that Columbus might discover something unexpected—as indeed he did.[^140]

John's attempt to disinherit the legal heir Manuel in favor of his illegitimate son Jorge reveals a willingness to destabilize the succession for personal reasons, potentially plunging Portugal into civil war had he succeeded.[^141] Only pressure from the Pope, his wife, and the Spanish monarchs prevented what could have been a catastrophic succession crisis.[^142]

Finally, critics note that John's health problems and early death at forty may have been exacerbated by the immense stress of ruling through fear and the psychological toll of his violent actions.[^143] His suspicion that he was being poisoned, whether accurate or paranoid, suggests a ruler who understood that his methods had created many enemies who wished him dead.[^144]

## Famous Quotes

Historical records from the fifteenth century have not preserved many direct quotations from John II. However, several statements and exchanges have been documented:

> "Total obedience" - The royal orator's description of a subject's duty at the 1481 Cortes at Évora, asserting the king's authority as comparable to a Roman emperor or ancient Persian monarch.[^145]

> [Response to Poliziano's offer to write an epic about his achievements] - John replied positively in a letter dated October 23, 1491, to the Italian scholar who had compared his accomplishments to those of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.[^146]

> "The Portuguese would not even have sufficient room at sea for their African voyages" - John's argument for why the Pope's initial division of the New World was unacceptable, leading to the Treaty of Tordesillas negotiations.[^147]

While specific quotations are scarce, John's actions spoke volumes about his philosophy of governance. His imposition of the drastic oath at Évora, his personal execution of the Duke of Viseu, and his ruthless treatment of both nobility and refugees reveal a ruler who believed absolutely in the primacy of royal authority and the subordination of all other considerations to the interests of the Portuguese crown.[^148]
