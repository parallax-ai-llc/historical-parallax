## Summary

Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim) built the Salim Group into Indonesia's largest conglomerate during the Suharto era. His empire spanned cement (Indocement), food (Indofood), banking (BCA), and automobiles. He was Indonesia's richest person for decades. His close relationship with President Suharto was both the foundation and the vulnerability of his business empire, which was severely damaged during the 1997-98 crisis.
