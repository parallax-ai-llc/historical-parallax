## Summary

John Davison Rockefeller (1839-1937) was an American industrialist and philanthropist who founded Standard Oil Company, dominating the American petroleum industry and becoming the first American worth more than a billion dollars. At his peak, Rockefeller controlled ~90% of U.S. oil refining. Adjusted for inflation, he is often considered the wealthiest American in history. A controversial "robber baron" who used ruthless tactics to crush competition, Rockefeller later became philanthropist, establishing the University of Chicago, Rockefeller University, and the Rockefeller Foundation. His story embodies both the dark side of unregulated capitalism and the potential of philanthropy.

## Standard Oil

### Founding (1870)

With partners, founded Standard Oil Company in Cleveland, Ohio.

**Strategy:**
- Horizontal integration: Buy competing refineries
- Vertical integration: Control pipelines, distribution
- Economies of scale
- Secret railroad rebates (illegal advantages)

### Dominance

By 1880, controlled ~90% of U.S. oil refining.

**Tactics:**
- Predatory pricing (undercut competitors until they sold out)
- Railroad deals (secret rebates, drawbacks even on competitors' shipments)
- Industrial espionage
- Forced acquisitions ("join us or we'll destroy you")

### Standard Oil Trust (1882)

Created one of first major trusts—holding company controlling multiple refineries. Model for other industries.

### Antitrust

**1890:** Sherman Antitrust Act passed (partly response to Standard Oil)

**1911:** Supreme Court ordered Standard Oil broken up into 34 companies (including future Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Amoco, etc.)

Ironically, breakup made Rockefeller even richer—his shares in successor companies soared.
