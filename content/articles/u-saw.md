## Summary

U Saw (born March 16, 1900 – died May 8, 1948), also known as Galon U Saw, was a controversial Burmese nationalist politician who served as the third Prime Minister of British Burma from September 1940 to January 1942. A Mon-Burmese lawyer from Tharrawaddy District, he rose to prominence defending the leader of the 1930-32 peasant rebellion before founding the totalitarian-influenced Myochit (Patriot) Party in 1938[^1]. His political career ended in tragedy when he orchestrated the assassination of independence hero Aung San and seven cabinet ministers on July 19, 1947, leading to his execution by hanging on May 8, 1948[^2]. U Saw remains one of the most divisive figures in Myanmar's history, remembered both for his nationalist aspirations and his role in killing the nation's founding father.

## Early Life and Background

U Saw was born on March 16, 1900, in Okpho Township, Tharrawaddy District, in Lower Burma during the height of British colonial rule[^3]. He was of Mon-Burmese ethnic background, the second of four sons born to Phoe Kyuu (also spelled U Po Kyu), a prosperous local landowner, and his wife Daw Pann[^4]. Growing up in the rural Tharrawaddy region, U Saw witnessed firsthand the agrarian grievances that plagued Burmese farmers under colonial administration, where moneylenders and colonial officials often exploited peasant communities. These early experiences in a rural environment would later inform his populist political approach and nationalist sympathies[^5].

Unlike most prominent Burmese politicians of his generation who attended Rangoon University or studied abroad, U Saw received his education at a Roman Catholic missionary school in Gyobingauk, a modest institution that provided basic education but not the elite credentials enjoyed by many of his political contemporaries[^6]. Despite lacking a university education, U Saw possessed considerable intelligence and ambition. Through self-study and practical training, he obtained a legal license that qualified him to plead certain types of cases in colonial Burma's court system. By 1927, he had established himself as a senior lawyer, demonstrating both legal acumen and entrepreneurial drive[^7].

His formative years coincided with growing nationalist sentiment throughout Burma. The 1920s saw the emergence of various nationalist movements seeking greater autonomy from British India, to which Burma had been administratively attached since 1886. The separation of Burma from India in 1937 would become a pivotal issue in Burmese politics, one that U Saw would later champion as part of his nationalist platform. The economic hardships faced by Burmese farmers, combined with competition from Indian immigrant laborers and Chinese merchants, created fertile ground for nationalist politicians who promised to protect Burmese interests against foreign competition[^8].

The defining moment of U Saw's early career came with the Saya San Rebellion of 1930-32, a massive peasant uprising led by a former monk and traditional healer named Saya San. The rebellion, which drew upon Buddhist millennial beliefs and employed the mythical Galon bird as its symbol, represented one of the most significant challenges to British colonial authority in Burma. When Saya San was captured and put on trial by British authorities, U Saw joined his defense team alongside Dr. Ba Maw, another prominent nationalist lawyer. Although the defense ultimately failed and Saya San was executed in 1931, both Ba Maw and U Saw gained national prominence and reputations as defenders of Burmese nationalism[^9]. U Saw subsequently adopted the honorific title "Galon" from Saya San's rebel army, a name that would stay with him throughout his political career and symbolize his connection to populist resistance against colonial rule[^10].

## Rise to Power

U Saw's transformation from provincial lawyer to national political figure accelerated rapidly in the mid-1930s. In 1935, following a visit to Japan that deeply impressed him with that nation's rapid modernization and militaristic nationalism, U Saw's financial situation improved substantially, allegedly with Japanese support. He used these resources to purchase the Thuriya (Sun) newspaper, one of Rangoon's most influential Burmese-language publications[^11]. U Saw transformed the Thuriya into a powerful vehicle for self-promotion and political advocacy, using its pages to advance nationalist causes while building his personal brand. The newspaper became instrumental in spreading his political message and establishing him as a prominent voice in Burmese public discourse[^12].

In the 1936 general elections, U Saw successfully won a seat in the Legislative Council as a member of the United General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA)[^13]. The GCBA had been the dominant nationalist organization in the 1920s, though by the mid-1930s it had fragmented into competing factions. U Saw's election marked his entry into formal colonial politics, where he quickly established a reputation as an ambitious and aggressive politician willing to employ populist rhetoric to build support.

The visit to Japan in 1935 proved transformative for U Saw's political ideology. Greatly impressed by Japan's authoritarian government, military strength, and successful resistance to Western colonialism, U Saw aspired to rebuild Burma along similar totalitarian lines[^14]. In 1938, he founded the Myochit Party (also known as the Patriot Party or Freedom Bloc), which became the vehicle for his political ambitions. The party initially consisted of approximately ten members of parliament from wealthy backgrounds, drawing primarily from affluent Burmese landowners, merchants, and politicians who sought economic protections against Indian and Chinese immigrant competition[^15].

Most controversially, U Saw organized a private paramilitary force called the Galon Tat (Galon Army) in April 1938, explicitly modeled on Nazi Germany's storm troopers and fascist organizations in Europe[^16]. The Galon Tat was possibly funded by Japanese sources and by 1941 had grown to become the largest volunteer organization in the country, giving U Saw a significant private army to complement his political power[^17]. The Myochit Party's platform emphasized economic nationalism, advocating for limits on Indian immigration to Burma and redistribution of foreign-owned land to ethnic Burmese. This resonated with urban and rural elites who felt threatened by economic competition from immigrant communities[^18].

U Saw's rise continued when the government led by Prime Minister Ba Maw fell in 1939. The British Governor Archibald Cochrane included the Patriot's Party in the new government, and by September 1940, U Saw had maneuvered himself into the position of Prime Minister of Burma, becoming the third person to hold that office under the 1937 constitutional arrangements[^19]. At age 40, U Saw had reached the pinnacle of power in colonial Burma, controlling both the formal apparatus of government and a substantial private militia.

## Major Achievements

U Saw's tenure as Prime Minister from September 1940 to January 1942 occurred during one of the most turbulent periods in world history, as World War II engulfed Asia and threatened Burma's borders. His primary achievement during this period was maintaining governmental stability while navigating the complex pressures of wartime colonial administration. As Prime Minister, U Saw faced the challenge of balancing British demands for wartime cooperation against rising Burmese nationalist aspirations for independence[^20].

One of his most significant initiatives was his diplomatic mission to London in October 1941, where he sought to negotiate Burma's future status within the British Empire. Departing Burma on October 10, 1941, U Saw arrived in London with the explicit goal of securing British commitment to dominion status for Burma after the war in exchange for Burmese support during the conflict[^21]. Dominion status, which countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand enjoyed, would have granted Burma substantial autonomy while maintaining formal ties to the British Crown. This represented a pragmatic middle path between continued colonial subordination and complete independence.

During his London visit, U Saw engaged primarily with Leo Amery, the Secretary of State for India and Burma, pressing for explicit promises of post-war autonomy. He also secured a meeting with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, where he reiterated his requests for guarantees of dominion status to justify increased Burmese participation in the war effort[^22]. However, Churchill, preoccupied with sustaining the Empire's wartime defenses, viewed such colonial concessions as premature and potentially destabilizing during active hostilities. The mission ultimately failed to secure firm commitments from the British government, which prioritized military imperatives over colonial reforms[^23].

As Prime Minister, U Saw also worked to promote Burmese economic interests through his party's pro-business, pro-Burmese platform. The Myochit Party sought to protect Burmese merchants and landowners from what they perceived as unfair competition from Indian and Chinese immigrants, advocating for policies that would redistribute economic opportunities to ethnic Burmese[^24]. While these policies appealed to his base among wealthy Burmese elites, they also reflected the ethnic tensions that characterized colonial Burma's complex multi-ethnic society.

U Saw's control of the influential Thuriya newspaper gave him a powerful propaganda tool that he used effectively to shape public opinion and advance his political agenda. Through the newspaper, he promoted nationalist themes, criticized British colonial policies, and built a cult of personality around his Galon identity, connecting himself symbolically to the peasant rebellion that had earlier challenged British authority[^25]. His ability to mobilize both elite political support and popular nationalist sentiment through media control represented a significant political achievement in the colonial context.

His organization of the Galon Tat, which grew to become Burma's largest volunteer organization by 1941, demonstrated his capacity for political mobilization and organizational leadership. While modeled on fascist European paramilitaries, the Galon Tat provided U Saw with an independent power base outside the formal colonial governmental structure, giving him leverage in negotiations with both British authorities and rival Burmese political factions[^26].

## Controversies and Criticisms

U Saw's political career was marked by numerous controversies that ultimately overshadowed any achievements and defined his historical legacy. The most serious controversy emerged from his secret negotiations with Japanese representatives in December 1941, which led to his arrest and imprisonment. Frustrated by his failed mission to London and receiving no firm assurances from Churchill, U Saw detoured to Lisbon, Portugal, where he initiated secret contacts with Japanese diplomats[^27]. At these meetings, U Saw sought to negotiate potential Japanese support for Burmese nationalist independence efforts in exchange for cooperation if Japan invaded Burma, which by late 1941 appeared increasingly likely given Japan's aggressive expansion throughout Asia[^28].

British intelligence services uncovered evidence of these treasonous contacts, and U Saw was arrested in January 1942 in Haifa, Palestine (then under British mandate), while traveling from Lisbon back toward Burma[^29]. Incriminating documents recovered from his possession provided clear evidence of communications with Japanese agents, leading to accusations of disloyalty and collaboration with the enemy during wartime[^30]. This was an especially serious charge given that U Saw was serving as Prime Minister of British Burma at the time and had just completed an official diplomatic mission to London. The British authorities viewed his actions as a profound betrayal of trust and a threat to imperial security.

Following his arrest, U Saw was transported to Uganda, where he was interned in a British colonial detention facility for approximately four years, remaining imprisoned throughout the duration of World War II[^31]. This internment removed him from Burmese politics during the critical war years when Burma was invaded and occupied by Japan (1942-1945), and when new nationalist leaders like Aung San emerged to dominate the independence movement.

Beyond his wartime treachery, U Saw's political ideology and methods attracted substantial criticism. His open admiration for totalitarian regimes, particularly Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, and his modeling of the Galon Tat on fascist paramilitary organizations revealed authoritarian tendencies incompatible with democratic governance[^32]. Contemporary observers noted that U Saw "was corrupted by a demon-like personal ambition uncurbed by either a clear political faith or a conscience," suggesting he lacked coherent political principles beyond nationalist rhetoric and personal power-seeking[^33]. His political philosophy appeared opportunistic rather than principled, shifting positions based on perceived advantage rather than consistent ideology.

The Myochit Party's platform, while appealing to economic nationalism, was also criticized for promoting ethnic divisions and scapegoating Indian and Chinese immigrant communities for Burma's economic problems rather than addressing the structural issues of colonial exploitation[^34]. This ethnic nationalist approach contributed to communal tensions that would plague Burma for decades.

U Saw's control of the Thuriya newspaper, while politically effective, also raised concerns about media manipulation and propaganda. He transformed what had been an independent newspaper into a personal publicity vehicle, raising ethical questions about the relationship between political power and press freedom in colonial Burma[^35].

Most damningly, U Saw's orchestration of the assassination of Aung San and seven cabinet ministers on July 19, 1947, represented not just a political controversy but a national tragedy that altered Burma's historical trajectory. Left out of the post-war political process after his release from internment in 1945, and excluded from the independence negotiations that led to the January 1947 Attlee-Aung San Agreement, U Saw apparently believed that eliminating Aung San would create a power vacuum the British governor might fill by turning to him as Burma's leader[^36]. The assassination plot was poorly planned; gunmen were quickly traced to his residence, leading to his immediate arrest along with his co-conspirators[^37]. This act of political violence destroyed any remaining legitimacy he might have claimed as a nationalist leader.

---

## Personal Life

Information about U Saw's personal life remains relatively limited in historical sources, with his public political activities overshadowing details of his private relationships and family. U Saw was married to Than Khin, who had previously been married to Maung Galay, a criminal officer, but married U Saw after her first husband was killed[^38]. This marriage connected U Saw to other prominent families in Burmese society and provided him with important social connections that supported his political ambitions.

Than Khin demonstrated considerable loyalty to her husband during his legal troubles. After U Saw was convicted and sentenced to death for orchestrating the assassination of Aung San, Than Khin made desperate efforts to save his life, even attempting to hire a barrister-at-law from London to mount an appeal[^39]. These efforts proved unsuccessful when the High Court of Burma rejected all appeals on March 8, 1948, confirming the death sentence. According to historical accounts, U Saw requested that his wife pay life compensations to the families of the nine martyrs he had killed (Aung San and eight others who died in the assassination), and she honored this final request, paying eight of the nine families[^40].

After World War II, Than Khin became politically active in her own right, serving in the All Burma Women's Independence League alongside other prominent women including Khin Kyi (Aung San's widow and mother of Aung San Suu Kyi) and Lady Paw Tun[^41]. This involvement in the women's nationalist movement suggests Than Khin shared some of her husband's nationalist commitments, though she pursued them through different channels.

Historical sources do not mention U Saw having children, and no descendants have been prominently identified in subsequent Burmese/Myanmar history. This absence of documented offspring may reflect incomplete historical records or may indicate that U Saw indeed had no children to carry on his family line.

Regarding his personality and character, contemporary and historical assessments consistently describe U Saw as exceptionally ambitious, ruthless, and lacking in principled political philosophy. One assessment noted he was "corrupted by a demon-like personal ambition uncurbed by either a clear political faith or a conscience"[^42]. This characterization suggests a man driven primarily by personal power rather than ideological commitment or ethical constraints. His willingness to model his political organization on fascist movements, secretly negotiate with enemy powers during wartime, and ultimately resort to political assassination all support this assessment of his character.

U Saw's adoption of the "Galon" title from the peasant rebellion leader Saya San revealed his understanding of symbolic politics and his ability to connect himself to populist causes, even while his actual political base lay primarily among wealthy urban and rural elites rather than the peasant masses[^43]. This disconnect between populist symbolism and elitist reality characterized much of his political career.

At his execution on May 8, 1948, at Insein Prison, U Saw's final words revealed some capacity for acceptance of his fate. He stated that he harbored no grudge against the judges or prison wardens before saying goodbye to the prison governor[^44]. He was 48 years old at the time of his death. According to custom, he was buried in an unmarked grave within the prison grounds[^45], a final indignity that symbolically erased him from the landscape of the nation whose independence he had claimed to champion.

## Legacy

U Saw's legacy in Myanmar history is overwhelmingly negative, dominated by his role in assassinating Aung San, the nation's most revered independence hero. While U Saw once held positions of significant power and influence, his decision to orchestrate political murder irreversibly tarnished any positive contributions he might have made to Burma's nationalist movement. His execution less than four months after Burma achieved independence on January 4, 1948, symbolically removed him from the story of the new nation, though the consequences of his actions continued to reverberate through Myanmar's subsequent history[^46].

The assassination of Aung San and his cabinet on July 19, 1947, fundamentally altered Burma's political trajectory. Aung San had been the architect of the Panglong Agreement, which brought ethnic minority leaders into a federal framework promising autonomy and shared governance. His vision of a multi-ethnic, federal Burma might have addressed the ethnic tensions that have plagued Myanmar throughout its independent history[^47]. By killing Aung San before independence was achieved, U Saw inadvertently contributed to decades of ethnic conflict, military dictatorship, and civil war that characterized post-independence Burma. The leadership vacuum created by Aung San's death was filled by U Nu and eventually by military strongmen like Ne Win, whose authoritarian rule departed dramatically from Aung San's more inclusive vision[^48].

July 19, the date of the assassination, is commemorated annually in Myanmar as Martyrs' Day, a national holiday honoring Aung San and the other leaders killed in the attack[^49]. This institutionalization of memory ensures that U Saw's crime remains prominent in national consciousness, defining his historical reputation for subsequent generations. On these occasions, U Saw is invariably portrayed as the villain who destroyed Burma's best hope for democratic, federal governance, a traitor whose personal ambition led him to betray the nationalist cause he had once claimed to champion.

U Saw's earlier career as a nationalist politician, his role as Prime Minister during the critical wartime period, and his attempt to negotiate dominion status in London have been largely overshadowed by his final catastrophic act. Historians have noted that his political legacy was "marred by accusations and political betrayals that would haunt his memory for decades to come"[^50]. Even his genuine nationalist credentials—his defense of Saya San, his opposition to British colonialism, his attempt to secure greater autonomy—cannot overcome the moral weight of his responsibility for the assassination.

Some historians have suggested that U Saw's actions stemmed from a desperate desire to remain relevant in post-war Burmese politics after being sidelined during his wartime internment in Uganda. The rise of Aung San and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) during the Japanese occupation and subsequent British return left U Saw politically marginalized despite his pre-war prominence[^51]. His refusal to sign the Attlee-Aung San Agreement of January 27, 1947, isolated him further, as most other nationalist leaders united behind Aung San's negotiated settlement[^52]. This political desperation may explain, though certainly not excuse, his turn to violence as a means of reasserting his relevance.

The controversy surrounding British involvement in the assassination has also shaped U Saw's legacy. Captain David Vivian, a British Army officer, was convicted of supplying U Saw with weapons and sentenced to five years imprisonment (he later escaped during a Karen uprising in 1949)[^53]. The revelation that British officers had sold guns to U Saw and other Burmese politicians fueled conspiracy theories about possible British intelligence involvement in the assassination, theories that gained renewed attention from a BBC documentary on the 50th anniversary of the killing in 1997[^54]. While no conclusive evidence of high-level British complicity has emerged, these theories have complicated U Saw's legacy by raising questions about whether he acted purely from personal ambition or was manipulated by colonial authorities seeking to eliminate the increasingly independent-minded Aung San.

Contemporary scholars continue to examine U Saw's role in Burma's history. Historian Thant Myint-U and others have explored how U Saw's assassination of Aung San affected Burma's subsequent trajectory toward military rule and ethnic conflict[^55]. Some researchers have noted, "The echoes are still felt today... We live amidst shadows cast forth from decisions made long ago," highlighting how U Saw's actions in 1947 continue to influence Myanmar's political landscape in the 21st century[^56].

U Saw's legacy stands as a cautionary tale about unchecked political ambition, the dangers of authoritarian political movements, and the catastrophic consequences of political violence. Unlike Aung San, who is memorialized with statues, streets, and institutions bearing his name throughout Myanmar, U Saw is remembered primarily as a national villain, his name invoked as a symbol of betrayal and misguided ambition. His life demonstrates how a single disastrous decision can obliterate whatever positive contributions a political leader might have made, defining their historical reputation in perpetuity.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite the overwhelmingly negative consensus regarding U Saw's ultimate legacy, some scholars and historians have attempted to provide context for his earlier nationalist contributions and to understand his motivations within the complex political environment of colonial and wartime Burma. These more nuanced assessments, while never excusing his assassination of Aung San, acknowledge that U Saw was not always the villain he became by 1947.

U Saw's defense of Saya San during the 1931 trial represented a genuine act of nationalist commitment at a time when opposing British colonial authority carried significant personal and professional risks. Both U Saw and Dr. Ba Maw gained national prominence through their willingness to defend the peasant rebel leader, and U Saw's subsequent adoption of the "Galon" title demonstrated his identification with popular resistance movements[^57]. This early phase of his career showed courage and nationalist conviction that resonated with Burmese people seeking advocates against colonial oppression.

His efforts as Prime Minister to negotiate dominion status for Burma in 1941, while ultimately unsuccessful, represented an attempt to secure greater autonomy for Burma within the framework of wartime realities. Some historians have noted that U Saw's London mission was a pragmatic approach that recognized Burma's vulnerability during World War II while seeking to extract maximum concessions from Britain in exchange for wartime cooperation[^58]. His frustration with Churchill's refusal to make concrete commitments reflects the broader challenge faced by colonial nationalist leaders trying to leverage wartime circumstances to advance independence goals.

U Saw's economic nationalism, particularly his advocacy for protecting Burmese business interests against what he and his supporters perceived as unfair competition from immigrant communities, resonated with real economic grievances among ethnic Burmese. While his approach often veered into problematic ethnic nationalism, it addressed legitimate concerns about economic marginalization that many Burmese felt under colonial arrangements that favored Indian and Chinese merchants and laborers[^59]. His Myochit Party gave political voice to these economic anxieties, even if the solutions proposed were often divisive.

His organizational skills in building the Galon Tat into Burma's largest volunteer organization by 1941 demonstrated political acumen and mobilization capacity. Regardless of one's assessment of the organization's fascist-influenced ideology, U Saw's ability to create and lead such a substantial movement showed leadership capabilities that distinguished him from many colonial-era politicians[^60].

Some analysts have suggested that U Saw's secret contacts with Japanese representatives in 1941, while certainly treasonous from the British perspective, reflected a calculated hedge-betting strategy common among colonial nationalist leaders during the uncertain early years of World War II. Many Asian nationalists saw Japanese expansion as potentially offering liberation from Western colonialism, and U Saw's Lisbon contacts might be understood within this broader pattern of nationalist leaders exploring all possible avenues toward independence, even if it meant negotiating with multiple imperial powers against each other[^61].

### Negative Views

The scholarly and popular consensus on U Saw remains decidedly negative, with his assassination of Aung San defining his historical reputation as that of a traitor who destroyed Burma's best hope for stable, democratic, federal governance. Historians have consistently condemned not only his final catastrophic act but also the trajectory of his political career, which revealed authoritarian tendencies, opportunistic principles, and ruthless ambition.

U Saw's open admiration for totalitarian regimes and his explicit modeling of the Galon Tat on Nazi storm troopers revealed fundamentally undemocratic instincts that were incompatible with the inclusive, federal vision that leaders like Aung San championed[^62]. His political ideology, influenced by fascist movements in Europe and Japan, represented a dangerous authoritarian strand within Burmese nationalism that fortunately did not come to dominate the independence movement, though military authoritarianism would later plague independent Burma through different channels.

Contemporary observers' assessment that U Saw "was corrupted by a demon-like personal ambition uncurbed by either a clear political faith or a conscience" has been echoed by subsequent historians who see in his career a pattern of opportunistic position-shifting driven by self-interest rather than principled nationalism[^63]. His willingness to negotiate secretly with Japanese enemies while serving as Prime Minister of British Burma demonstrated a fundamental lack of integrity and loyalty that transcended legitimate nationalist resistance to become simple treachery.

The assassination of Aung San represents the strongest basis for negative historical assessment. The attack on July 19, 1947, killed not only Aung San but also seven cabinet ministers and two other individuals, eliminating much of Burma's emerging post-independence leadership in a single act of violence[^64]. The poor planning of the assassination, with gunmen quickly traced back to U Saw's residence, suggested that this was not a carefully considered political calculation but rather a desperate, reckless act driven by political marginalization and personal resentment[^65].

U Saw's motivation—apparently hoping that the British governor would turn to him to lead Burma after eliminating Aung San—revealed delusional thinking disconnected from political reality. By 1947, the AFPFL led by Aung San had won overwhelming popular support in elections, and British authorities had committed to Burmese independence under Aung San's leadership. No realistic scenario existed in which U Saw, a recently released internee with a record of wartime collaboration with Japan, would be installed as Burma's leader[^66]. This disconnect from reality, combined with his willingness to resort to mass murder to achieve his delusions, marks him as fundamentally unfit for leadership.

Historians examining Burma's subsequent tragic history of military coups, ethnic conflict, and authoritarian rule have identified U Saw's assassination of Aung San as a critical turning point that derailed Burma's potential democratic development. Scholar after scholar has noted that Aung San's inclusive vision and political skills might have successfully navigated the challenges of ethnic federalism and democratic institution-building that his successors failed to manage[^67]. U Saw's decision to murder Aung San thus bears partial responsibility for decades of suffering and conflict in Myanmar.

The fact that U Saw attempted to shift blame to his subordinates during his trial, despite overwhelming evidence of his leadership role in planning the assassination, demonstrated moral cowardice that compounded his crimes. He showed no remorse for his actions and no recognition of the catastrophic consequences his decisions had inflicted on his country[^68].

U Saw's ethnic nationalist rhetoric, which scapegoated Indian and Chinese communities for Burma's economic problems, contributed to communal tensions and ethnic violence that periodically erupted in colonial and post-independence Burma. His political approach emphasized ethnic division rather than national unity, a legacy that has proven deeply destructive in Myanmar's multi-ethnic society[^69].

Ultimately, U Saw is remembered as a tragic example of how personal ambition, unchecked by ethical constraints or realistic political judgment, can transform a nationalist leader into a national villain whose single act of violence overshadows any earlier contributions and fundamentally alters his nation's historical trajectory for the worse.
