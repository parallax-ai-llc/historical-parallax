## Summary

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881-1938) was a Turkish field marshal, revolutionary statesman, and the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey. He led the Turkish War of Independence following World War I and implemented sweeping political, legal, cultural, social, and economic reforms that transformed Turkey from a multi-ethnic Islamic empire into a modern, secular, and Western-oriented nation-state.[^1] While revered as a national hero in Turkey and recognized internationally for his modernization efforts, his legacy remains controversial due to authoritarian governance, ethnic policies against minorities, and the suppression of Kurdish identity.[^2] His reforms fundamentally shaped modern Turkey and continue to influence Turkish politics and society today.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was born in 1881 in Salonika (now Thessaloníki, Greece), which was then part of the Ottoman Empire.[^4] He was initially given only the name Mustafa. His father, Ali Rıza Efendi, had been a lieutenant in a local militia unit during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 and worked as a customs official and timber merchant, while his mother, Zübeyde Hanım, came from a farming community west of Salonika.[^5] Of nine siblings (five sharing at least one parent), only Atatürk's biological sister, Makbule (1885-1956), survived him.[^6] His mother's first three children—Fatma, Ömer, and Ahmet—all died in early childhood, making Mustafa the fourth child.[^7]

Ali Rıza died in 1888 when Mustafa was only seven years old, a loss that profoundly affected the young boy.[^8] Following her husband's death, Zübeyde Hanım later married Ragıp Bey, who was also a widower with four children.[^9] Despite his mother's preference for religious education, Ali Rıza had ensured that Mustafa's earliest education was carried out in a modern secular school rather than a traditional religious institution—a decision that would foreshadow the boy's future path.[^10]

Mustafa attended a military school for his secondary education in Salonika, where his mathematics teacher gave him the additional name "Kemal"—meaning "perfection"—because he excelled in academics.[^11] This combination of names, Mustafa Kemal, would become famous throughout the world. He subsequently entered the War College in Constantinople (Istanbul), followed by the prestigious General Staff College.[^12] On January 11, 1905, he graduated from the Army War College with the rank of Captain, beginning what would become an extraordinary military career.[^13]

During his formative years, young Mustafa Kemal was exposed to the progressive ideas circulating among Ottoman military officers and intellectuals who sought to modernize the declining empire. This intellectual environment, combined with his secular education and military training, shaped his worldview and planted the seeds of the revolutionary reforms he would later implement. His early experiences witnessing the Ottoman Empire's decline and the conflicts between modernists and traditionalists deeply influenced his conviction that radical transformation was necessary for survival in the modern world.

## Rise to Power

Mustafa Kemal's rise to prominence began during World War I, when he became the outstanding front-line commander during the Gallipoli campaign (1915-1916), gaining much respect from both allies and former enemies for his military prowess and chivalry in victory.[^14] On April 25, 1915, when Allied forces landed at Ariburnu (Gallipoli), Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, stopped their progress and correctly identified where the Allies would land twice, inspiring his men to hold onto the vital Sari Bair ridge.[^15] He famously told his soldiers before one critical engagement: "I am not ordering you to attack, I am ordering you to die."[^16] His tactical brilliance at Gallipoli, where he organized a successful fightback which secured the heights of Chunuk Bair and forced the ANZACs to retreat to the beach, established his reputation as a military genius.[^17] For this success, he was promoted to Brigadier-General on April 1, 1916.[^18]

During the war, Kemal gained fame not only as a successful commander on three Ottoman fronts but also as a fierce critic of the Young Turk government and its German allies, demonstrating early signs of his independent thinking and nationalist convictions.[^19] Following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I and the subsequent occupation of Anatolia by Allied forces, the empire faced dismemberment under the Treaty of Sèvres. Greek forces occupied Smyrna (İzmir) and advanced into Anatolia, while French and Italian forces controlled southern regions, and the British maintained a presence in Constantinople.[^20]

On May 19, 1919, Mustafa Kemal departed from Constantinople to Samsun, a date accepted as the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence and the initial organization of opposition under his leadership.[^21] This moment marked the transformation from military commander to revolutionary leader. Officially sent by the Ottoman government to disband nationalist resistance groups, Kemal instead began organizing them into a cohesive movement. On December 27, 1919, he arrived in Ankara with the Executive Committee, establishing what would become the center of the nationalist movement.[^22]

When a parliament, called the Grand National Assembly (GNA), met in Ankara on April 23, 1920, the assembly elected Mustafa Kemal as its president, establishing the provisional "Ankara government" in opposition to the Ottoman government in Constantinople.[^23] Leading Turkish forces, Atatürk won incredible battles against the occupying forces—including the first and second Battles of İnönü, the pivotal Battle of Sakarya (August 23-September 13, 1921), and the decisive Great Offensive—until the Turkish victory was secured.[^24] His ultimate military triumph came in the 1922 Great Offensive (Büyük Taarruz), where he served as Commander-in-Chief, meticulously planning and executing the final offensive that began on August 26, 1922, leading to the complete expulsion of enemy forces by September 18, 1922, and securing the nation's independence.[^25]

## Major Achievements

Following military victory, Mustafa Kemal embarked on one of the most comprehensive state-building and modernization projects in modern history. On November 1, 1922, the Grand National Assembly accepted his proposal to abolish the Sultanate, ending over six centuries of Ottoman rule.[^26] After successfully negotiating the Treaty of Lausanne in July 1923, which recognized Turkey's sovereignty and borders, the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed on October 29, 1923, with Mustafa Kemal elected as its first President.[^27]

Atatürk's reforms, also referred to as the Turkish Revolution, were a series of political, legal, religious, cultural, social, and economic policy changes designed to transform the new Republic of Turkey into a secular, modern nation-state.[^28] In 1924, he abolished the caliphate, marking the first time in Islamic history that no ruler claimed the spiritual leadership of Islam—a revolutionary act that separated the new Turkish state from its Islamic imperial past.[^29] By 1935, when the last part of his reforms removed the reference to Islam in the Constitution, Turkey became a secular and democratic republic that derives its sovereignty from the people.[^30]

His educational reforms were particularly transformative. He made primary education free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools throughout the country.[^31] The literacy rate within the Republic of Turkey rose from 9% to 33% in only ten years.[^32] In November 1928, he replaced the Arabic script with the Latin alphabet for writing Turkish, personally educating the public on the new Turkish alphabet at Sarayburnu on August 9, 1928.[^33] Historian Bernard Lewis described this as "slamming a door on the past as well as opening a door to the future," setting Turkey on the path to achieving one of the highest literacy rates in the Middle East.[^34]

Atatürk's commitment to women's rights was groundbreaking for a Muslim-majority nation in the early 20th century. Turkish women received the same rights as men, could be appointed to official posts, and gained the right to vote and be elected to Parliament on December 8, 1934—making Turkey one of the first countries in the world to grant women suffrage.[^35] A secular legal code, modeled along European lines, completely altered laws affecting women, marriage, and family relations.[^36] He famously declared: "Everything we see in the world is the creative work of women."[^37]

To promote modernization and Westernization, Atatürk implemented cultural reforms including changing the weekly holiday from Friday to Sunday, adopting the Gregorian calendar instead of the Muslim lunar calendar, and encouraging Western dress.[^38] On August 24, 1924, he wore a hat at Sarayburnu in Istanbul as part of Turkey's modernization efforts, symbolically rejecting the traditional fez.[^39] He established the Turkish Historical Society on April 12, 1931, and the Turkish Linguistic Society on July 12, 1932, to promote Turkish national identity and reform the Turkish language.[^40]

His economic policies emphasized statism (etatism), with the state regulating the country's general economic activity and engaging in areas where private enterprise was unwilling or inadequate.[^41] This moderate etatism should not be confused with socialist statism, as it supported an eventual transformation into a free market economy while allowing state intervention where national interest required it.[^42] The shortage of skilled labor and entrepreneurs (caused largely by the reduction of Greek and Armenian communities), the lack of capital, and intense nationalist desire for industrial self-sufficiency stimulated a movement toward state ownership or control in the 1930s.[^43] Key institutions including Sümerbank (1933), Halkbank (1933), and Etibank (1935) were established as industrial facilities combining state capital with public deposits.[^44] The Turkish economy developed at an exceptional rate, with heavy industrial production increasing by 150% and GDP per capita rising from $800 to around $2,000 by the late 1930s, on par with Japan.[^45]

On June 16, 1934, the Grand National Assembly passed a law granting Mustafa Kemal the surname "Atatürk" (Father of Turks), recognizing his role as the founder of modern Turkey.[^46] In 1981, the centennial of Atatürk's birth, his memory was honored by the United Nations and UNESCO, which declared it "The Atatürk Year in the World," recognizing him as someone who "worked for international understanding, co-operation, and peace" and as one of the first leaders to fight against colonialism and imperialism.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Atatürk's rule and policies generated significant controversy and criticism, particularly regarding his treatment of ethnic minorities and his authoritarian governance style. His new ideology aimed to create a secular and purely Turkish state under one language, one ethnicity, and one culture, which resulted in suppressing all other cultures, religions, and ethnicities, requiring the elimination, assimilation, and repression of Kurdish identity.[^48] From 1923 onward, Atatürk's repression of Kurdish nationalism was described as savage and predatory, with his government filling the Kurdish southeast with Turkish administrators, giving land to Turkish war veterans, forbidding the use of Kurdish language in court, and banning the native tongue in schools.[^49]

Italian historian Giulio Sappeli argued that "The ideals of Kemal Atatürk meant that war against the Kurds was always seen as a historical mission aimed at affirming the superiority of being Turkish."[^50] The Sheikh Said rebellion of 1925, considered the first large-scale rebellion against the newly proclaimed Republican regime, was crushed with continual aerial bombardments and massive concentration of forces, with over 7,000 people prosecuted by Independence tribunals and more than 600 executed.[^51] By mid-1925, the government initiated a pogrom in Diyarbakır, executing civilians and burning villages to the ground, which destroyed about 206 villages and killed 15,200 people.[^52] Other large-scale Kurdish revolts occurred in Ararat in 1930 and Dersim in 1937-38, with the British consul at Trebizond explicitly comparing the brutal and indiscriminate acts of violence in Dersim to the 1915 Armenian genocide.[^53]

Atatürk's policies toward Christian minorities were equally devastating. During and after the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), the ethnic cleansing of Armenians and Greeks from Anatolia outside of Istanbul was largely completed via large-scale massacres, flight, expulsions, and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey.[^54] By the time of Mustafa Kemal's capture of Smyrna in September 1922, over a million Greek Orthodox Ottoman subjects had fled their homes in Turkey.[^55] His followers were responsible for expelling or murdering many Christians from Anatolia, with nearly 100,000 Armenians massacred in Transcaucasia by the Turkish army and another 100,000 fleeing from Cilicia.[^56] With the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, 1.5 million Orthodox Christians and 500,000 Muslims were forced to leave their homes in what amounted to internationally administered ethnic cleansing.[^57] By 1924, the Christian population of Turkey proper had been reduced from 4.4 million in 1912 to 700,000, with the percentage of Christians declining from 20-25% in 1914 to 3-5.5% in 1927.[^58]

Politically, Atatürk regarded a stage of personal authoritarian rule as necessary for securing his reforms before entrusting government to democratic processes.[^59] For two decades Turkey was under a paternalist one-party authoritarian dictatorship, with Atatürk governing essentially by personal rule in a one-party state.[^60] Republican Turkey became the third one-party state of Interwar Europe, after the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy.[^61] Martial law was declared, all political parties except the Republican People's Party (CHP) were banned, and all newspapers beyond state-approved papers were prohibited.[^62] Despite repeatedly requesting that opposition parties be established to transition into multi-party democracy, Atatürk never succeeded in establishing a long-lasting multi-party parliamentary system during his presidency.[^63] When Kâzım Karabekir established the Progressive Republican Party in 1924, it was banned after its members' involvement in the Sheikh Said rebellion, and the Liberal Republican Party established in 1930 was dissolved by its founder.[^64]

Critics have described Kemalism as envisaging "a homogenized nation, a disciplined society, a controlled economy and authoritarian politics."[^65] Some scholars have argued that there is continuity from Mustafa Kemal Atatürk to later authoritarian leaders, as both served the same class interests, and that Turkey's divisions are rooted in an ideology sometimes called "Kemalism," described by critics as a resilient strain of authoritarianism.[^66] For historians of modern Turkey, Kemalism appeared the chief culprit behind oppressive political policies that prevented Turkey's healthy democratization.[^67]

## Personal Life

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk married only once, to Latife Uşaklıgil (or Uşşaki), a multilingual and self-confident woman educated in Europe who came from an established, ship-owning family from Smyrna (İzmir).[^68] Atatürk met Latife during the recapture of occupied Smyrna on September 8, 1922, and was invited to the Uşaklıgil residence during his stay.[^69] They married on January 29, 1923, in İzmir, but the marriage lasted only until August 5, 1925.[^70] The couple's marriage shattered after a short while due to Atatürk's drinking problem and lifestyle.[^71] At a public tour of Erzurum in 1925, the situation reached a boiling point when they quarreled in public, and Mustafa asked her to go back to Ankara, with the public outbursts convincing him that the marriage had to end.[^72] Neither remarried after their divorce.

He had no biological children from his marriage but had eight adopted daughters and one son: Zehra Aylin, Sabiha (Gökçen), Rukiye (Erkin), Afet (İnan), Nebile (Bayyurt), Afife, Fikriye, Ülkü (Doğançay, later Adatepe), and Mustafa.[^73] Additionally, he had two children under his protection, Abdurrahim Tuncak and İhsan.[^74] His adoption of these children, particularly the girls, was partly motivated by his commitment to demonstrating women's potential in the new Turkey—several of his adopted daughters became accomplished professionals in their own right.

Atatürk enjoyed reading, listening to music, dancing, horseback riding, and swimming, and had an extreme interest in Zeybek (Western Anatolian) folk dances, Rumeli (Balkan Peninsula) folk songs, and wrestling.[^75] However, his personal life was also marked by heavy alcohol consumption, which contributed to his health problems and the breakdown of his marriage. His mother, Zübeyde Hanım, whom he deeply loved, died on January 14, 1923, in İzmir, shortly before the proclamation of the Republic.[^76]

On November 10, 1938, at 9:05 AM, Atatürk died in his bedroom at the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul at the age of 57.[^77] The cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver, attributed to his chronic alcoholism. His death marked the end of an era, though his legacy would continue to shape Turkish politics and society for generations to come.

## Legacy

Atatürk's legacy is complex and multifaceted, with his greatest achievement being the establishment and stabilization of the modern Turkish state.[^78] His policies not only stabilized the country but also enabled it to begin competing with Western nations on a more even level.[^79] The literacy reforms, educational expansion, legal modernization, and economic development laid foundations that transformed Turkey from a failing empire into a functioning modern nation-state. His vision for a secular, modern, and democratic nation continues to inspire and shape Turkish society and politics, with his principles, known as Kemalism, remaining influential in Turkey's governance and education system.[^80]

Atatürk's personality cult and the Kemalist historiography developed around it have had significant and ongoing influences on Turkey's political culture and historical narrative.[^81] Statues and portraits of Atatürk are commonly found in city squares, schools, and public offices throughout Turkey, and his face appears on all official documents, buildings, coins, and banknotes.[^82] His famous motto, "Peace at home, peace in the world," became the guiding principle of Turkish foreign policy.[^83] He declared that "One day my mortal body will turn to dust, but the Turkish Republic will stand forever," expressing his hope that his reforms would outlast him.[^84]

According to scholarly assessments, "One cannot understand what is happening in Turkey nowadays without taking an in-depth look at the life of the founder of the Republic of Turkey," indicating his enduring relevance to contemporary Turkish affairs.[^85] The transformation he led fundamentally altered the trajectory of a nation and demonstrated that rapid, comprehensive modernization was possible even in the most challenging circumstances. His emphasis on education—captured in his statement "Our true mentor in life is science" and "Teachers are the one and only people who save nations"—reflected his belief that knowledge and rational thinking were essential for national progress.[^86]

However, his legacy remains deeply contested. The authoritarian methods he employed, the suppression of ethnic and religious diversity, and the forced homogenization of Turkish society created wounds that persist today. The Kurdish question, minority rights, and debates over secularism versus religious expression in public life all trace back to decisions and policies from the Atatürk era. Contemporary Turkey continues to grapple with balancing the Kemalist vision of secular nationalism with demands for greater democracy, pluralism, and recognition of diverse identities.

The international recognition he received, particularly the 1981 UNESCO declaration honoring his commitment to international understanding, cooperation, peace, and human rights, stands in tension with the darker aspects of his domestic policies.[^87] This duality—a visionary modernizer who also employed authoritarian and exclusionary methods—makes Atatürk one of the most debated figures in 20th-century history. His statement "To see me does not necessarily mean to see my face. To understand my thoughts is to have seen me" suggests he hoped to be judged by his ideas and vision rather than his physical presence or personality cult.[^88]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many scholars and historians celebrate Atatürk as a transformative leader who accomplished remarkable modernization. Some describe him as the "architect" of "the most successful social modernization program of the 20th century," while others compare him to "George Washington and Henry Ford all rolled into one" and call him "the father" of modern Turkey.[^89] Scholarly works exploring perceptions of Kemalism in countries like Persia, Afghanistan, China, India, and other parts of the Muslim world show mostly positive views, recognizing his influence as a model for modernization and anti-colonial resistance.[^90]

Supporters emphasize that his reforms liberated Turkey from centuries of theocratic rule and positioned the nation to compete in the modern world. The establishment of universal education, women's rights, scientific advancement, and secular governance are viewed as progressive achievements that fundamentally improved the lives of Turkish citizens. The fact that Turkey emerged as a unified, independent nation from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, when many predicted its complete partition among European powers, is attributed to Atatürk's military genius and political vision.

His defenders argue that the authoritarian measures were necessary given the context: a nation emerging from war, facing internal rebellions, surrounded by hostile powers, and attempting unprecedented transformation. They contend that without strong centralized leadership, the fragile republic would have collapsed, and the reforms would have been reversed by conservative forces. From this perspective, Atatürk's methods, while harsh, were pragmatic responses to existential challenges.

Princeton University Press's biography notes his international significance, describing him as a figure whose impact extended beyond Turkey to influence anti-colonial movements and modernization efforts throughout the developing world.[^91] His military victories against European imperial powers made him a symbol of resistance to colonialism, while his secular reforms provided an alternative model to both Western imperialism and Islamic traditionalism.

### Negative Views

However, critics present a starkly different assessment. For historians of modern Turkey, the regime and ideology of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk made a particularly easy target, as Kemalism appeared the chief culprit behind oppressive political policies that prevented Turkey's healthy democratization, leading contemporary historians to attack the intellectual foundations of Kemalism.[^92] Turkish racists, particularly Nihal Atsız and his circle, attacked Atatürk's leadership from the right, condemning Turkey's foreign policy and ridiculing Kemalist attempts at building a civic nation model, never considering Atatürk and the Kemalists as fellow nationalists and questioning their nationalist credentials.[^93]

Critical scholars emphasize the violent suppression of minorities, particularly Kurds, Armenians, and Greeks, arguing that the creation of a homogeneous Turkish nation-state came at an unconscionable human cost. They point to the forced population exchanges, massacres, cultural suppression, and denial of basic rights to non-Turkish populations as evidence that Atatürk's modernization was built on ethnic cleansing and cultural genocide. The Kurdish rebellions and their brutal suppression are cited as examples of how the Kemalist vision could not tolerate ethnic diversity or regional autonomy.

There is ongoing controversy about Atatürk's religious beliefs and his relationship with Islam. Some researchers emphasize that his discourses about religion are periodic and that his positive views related to this subject are limited to the early 1920s, suggesting his secularism became increasingly hostile to religious expression over time.[^94] Critics argue that his aggressive secularization, including banning religious orders, closing religious schools, and suppressing Islamic practice in public life, alienated traditional segments of society and created lasting tensions between secular and religious Turks.

The one-party authoritarian system he established is condemned as laying the groundwork for later authoritarian tendencies in Turkish politics. Critics argue that by concentrating power, suppressing opposition, controlling media, and creating a cult of personality, Atatürk established patterns of governance that undermined genuine democracy. The fact that Turkey struggled with military coups, political instability, and authoritarian backsliding throughout the 20th and into the 21st century is partly attributed to the authoritarian foundations of the Kemalist state.

Debates about Atatürk include those who employed a discourse of freedom referring to the right of people to see Atatürk from a different angle, while others claimed that alternative portrayals would give youth a distorted image and strongly condemned such representations in terms of historical veracity.[^95] This ongoing contestation over how Atatürk should be remembered and evaluated reflects deeper ideological and political divisions within Turkish society and international academia.[^96] The question remains whether he should be primarily remembered as a visionary modernizer who saved Turkey or as an authoritarian leader whose methods and policies created lasting injustices and conflicts.
