## Summary

Sigmar Polke was a German painter whose playful, subversive works explored painting's boundaries through unconventional materials. Co-founding Capitalist Realism, he used halftone dots and chemical processes to question artistic conventions. His irreverent wit makes him one of the most original postwar artists.
