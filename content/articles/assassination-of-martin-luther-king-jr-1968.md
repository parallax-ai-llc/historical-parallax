## Overview

On April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the most prominent leader of the American Civil Rights Movement, was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. A single rifle shot, fired from a nearby rooming house, struck the 39-year-old Baptist minister as he stood on the motel's second-floor balcony. King died at St. Joseph's Hospital approximately one hour later. His death sparked riots in over 100 American cities, accelerated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and left a lasting wound on the nation.
