## Summary

Umetaro Suzuki isolated the first vitamin — thiamine (vitamin B1) — from rice bran in 1910, identifying it as the anti-beriberi factor. He called it aberic acid (later oryzanin). His discovery predated Casimir Funk's similar work, but language barriers prevented international recognition. His research saved millions from beriberi in East Asia.
