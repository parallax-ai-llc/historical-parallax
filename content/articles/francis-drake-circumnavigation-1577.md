## Overview

Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540 – 1596) was the embodiment of the Elizabethan sea dog: a brilliant navigator, a charismatic leader, and a state-sponsored pirate (*privateer*). He was the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe (1577–1580), and unlike Magellan, he survived the entire journey to accept the glory. His voyage around the world was not originally planned as a circumnavigation but as a raid on the Spanish Pacific coast. It turned into a heist of epic proportions, netting so much treasure that it paid off England’s entire national debt. To the English, he was a protestant hero; to the Spanish, he was *El Draque* (The Dragon), a devilish sorcerer.

## The Secret Voyage Begins (1577)

**The Mission:** Queen Elizabeth I secretly invested in the voyage. Her orders were to "annoy the King of Spain" in his unguarded territories (the Pacific coast of South America).
**The Fleet:** Five ships, led by the *Pelican* (later renamed *Golden Hind*).
**The Trial at St. Julian:**
Like Magellan, Drake faced mutiny at Port St. Julian in Patagonia. He tried and executed his co-commander Thomas Doughty for witchcraft and treason.
"The sternest justice is the best mercy."

## The Golden Hind 

The flagship was small (only 100 tons), hardly larger than a modern trawler.
Once they passed the Straits of Magellan, a storm blew them south.
**Drake Passage:** Drake realized that Tierra del Fuego was an island, implying the Atlantic and Pacific met. This meant there was a sea route south of South America (though he didn't use it).

## The Great Raid (The "Spanish Lake")

Entering the Pacific, Drake was the only enemy ship in thousands of miles of Spanish water. The Spanish towns were undefended because no one else had ever sailed there.
He raided Valparaiso and Lima, stealing wine and gold.
**The Cacafuego (The "Shitfire"):**
Drake chased the Spanish treasure galleon *Nuestra Señora de la Concepción*.
He disguised his ship as a slow merchant vessel, then struck.
**The Haul:**
- 26 tons of silver.
- 80 lbs of gold.
- 13 chests of pieces of eight.
It took 4 days to transfer the loot. The *Golden Hind* sat so low in the water it was barely seaworthy.
Drake joked with the Spanish captain, gave him gifts, and let him go (gentleman pirate).

## Nova Albion (California)

Drake couldn't go back south (Spanish warships were waiting). He tried to go North (Northwest Passage) but it got too cold.
**June 1579:** He landed on the coast of California (likely Point Reyes or Drake's Bay, north of San Francisco).
He repaired his ship for 5 weeks.
**First Contact:** The Coast Miwok people greeted them. Drake nailed a brass plate to a post, claiming the land for Queen Elizabeth, naming it **Nova Albion** (New Britain).

## The Return (1580)

He crossed the Pacific (68 days without sight of land).
Stopped in the Spice Islands (Moluccas) to buy 6 tons of cloves.
**Near Disaster:**
The *Golden Hind* hit a reef in Indonesia. They were stuck for 20 hours.
Drake ordered the cannons and half the cloves thrown overboard to lighten the ship. A change in wind freed them.

**Arrival:** Plymouth, Sept 26, 1580.
First question Drake asked a fisherman: *"Is the Queen still alive?"* (If a Catholic King was on throne, he would be hanged).
She was alive.

## The Payoff

The Queen received a 4,700% return on her investment.
Her share alone was more than the Crown's entire annual income.
**The Knighting:**
Elizabeth dined on his ship. She handed the sword to the French ambassador to tap Drake's shoulder, knighting him. This implicated France in the piracy, preventing Spain from declaring war on England alone. Political genius.
