## Summary

Pakubuwono II (also transliterated Pakubuwana II), born Raden Mas Probosuyoso on December 8, 1711, was the Susuhunan (ruler) of the Mataram Sultanate from 1726 until his death in 1749.[^1] His reign was marked by devastating rebellions, Dutch colonial intervention, and the destruction of the royal capital at Kartasura, which forced him to establish a new capital at Surakarta in 1745.[^2] On his deathbed in 1749, he controversially surrendered the sovereignty of Mataram to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), an act that precipitated the kingdom's division and marked the end of unified Javanese power.[^3] His legacy remains profoundly ambiguous—revered as the founder of Surakarta's kraton yet condemned as the ruler who surrendered his kingdom's independence.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Pakubuwono II was born as Raden Mas Probosuyoso on December 8, 1711, into the royal lineage of Mataram at a time when the sultanate was already deeply entangled with Dutch colonial interests.[^5] His father was Sunan Amangkurat IV, who ruled from 1719 to 1726 during the turbulent Second Javanese War of Succession.[^6] His mother, Ratu Amangkurat (also known as Ratu Mas Kadipaten), was a queen consort of royal descent from Sunan Kudus, connecting young Probosuyoso to multiple royal bloodlines within the Javanese aristocracy.[^7]

The young prince grew up during one of the most unstable periods in Mataram's history. His grandfather, Pakubuwono I, had ruled from 1705 to 1719 and had significantly expanded Dutch influence by ceding territories in exchange for military support.[^8] When Pakubuwono I died in 1719, succession disputes erupted as rival princes contested Amangkurat IV's right to the throne.[^9] Princes Blitar and Purbaya, brothers of Amangkurat IV, attacked the palace in June 1719, beginning the Second Javanese War of Succession that would last until 1723.[^10]

Growing up in this environment of palace intrigue, civil war, and Dutch intervention profoundly shaped Probosuyoso's worldview. The rebellion was suppressed only with extensive VOC military assistance, reinforcing the pattern of Mataram rulers becoming increasingly dependent on Dutch support to maintain power.[^11] The young prince witnessed firsthand how his father's reign was secured not through traditional Javanese legitimacy but through cannons mounted in Dutch forts and European military tactics.[^12]

Probosuyoso received an education befitting a Javanese crown prince, learning court etiquette, Javanese literature including the traditional babad chronicles, and the complexities of statecraft in an era when indigenous authority was increasingly circumscribed by European colonial power.[^13] The Javanese cosmological understanding of kingship—in which the sultan served as the cosmic center connecting the sacred volcano Mount Merapi to the north and the mystical South Sea—remained part of his cultural formation, even as practical political power shifted to Dutch trading houses.[^14]

When his father Amangkurat IV died in 1726, the fifteen-year-old Raden Mas Probosuyoso ascended to the throne, taking the regal title Sri Susuhunan Pakubuwono II.[^15] His accession was not without controversy; he had to remove his strongest competitor, his own brother Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara, reflecting the ongoing pattern of fratricidal succession struggles that had weakened Mataram for generations.[^16] The young ruler inherited a kingdom already diminished—his grandfather and father had ceded vast territories along Java's north coast to the VOC, and Mataram's sovereignty was increasingly nominal.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Pakubuwono II's rise to power at the age of fifteen in August 1726 represented both continuity and crisis for the Mataram Sultanate.[^18] Unlike the powerful sultans of Mataram's golden age, such as Sultan Agung who had besieged Batavia in the 1620s, Pakubuwono II came to power as a client ruler whose authority depended substantially on Dutch backing.[^19] His ascension followed the established pattern of VOC interference in Javanese succession disputes—a pattern that had begun in 1674 and intensified throughout the eighteenth century.[^20]

The new susuhunan established his court at Kartasura, the capital that his great-grandfather Amangkurat II had founded in 1680 after abandoning the inauspicious site of Plered.[^21] Kartasura, located in the land of Pajang on the northern stretch between the sacred mountains Merapi and Lawu, served as the ceremonial and administrative center of what remained of Mataram's domain.[^22] The kraton (palace complex) embodied Javanese cosmological principles, with seven symmetrically arranged courtyards radiating outward from the ruler as the symbolic center of the cosmos.[^23]

For the first sixteen years of his reign, Pakubuwono II ruled with relative stability.[^24] He navigated the complex relationship with the VOC, which had become the dominant power in Java through its control of coastal trade, strategic fortifications, and superior military technology.[^25] The Dutch had systematically acquired Javanese territory through a calculated strategy: supporting various claimants to the throne during succession wars, then extracting territorial concessions as payment for military assistance.[^26]

In 1704, Dutch forces had assisted in replacing Amangkurat III with Pakubuwono I in return for further territorial cessions.[^27] This pattern continued under Amangkurat IV during the Second Javanese War of Succession (1719-1723), when VOC cannons and troops proved decisive in defeating rival princes.[^28] By the time Pakubuwono II took power, Mataram had already lost the Preanger regions of western Java and substantial portions of the north coast.[^29]

The young sultan's authority rested on a delicate balance. Within Javanese society, he maintained traditional claims to legitimacy through his descent from the semi-mythical founders of Mataram and through elaborate court rituals that positioned him as the earthly representative of cosmic order.[^30] Yet in practical terms, Dutch control of maritime trade, fortified coastal positions, and military superiority meant that the sultan governed only with VOC consent.[^31]

Pakubuwono II attempted to manage competing pressures from Javanese aristocratic factions within his court, restive princes who resented growing Dutch influence, and VOC officials who continually sought to expand their economic and political control.[^32] This impossible balancing act would ultimately collapse in 1742, transforming his reign from one of relative stability into catastrophic crisis.[^33]

## Major Achievements

### Establishment of Surakarta (1745)

Pakubuwono II's most enduring achievement was the founding of Surakarta (Solo) as a new royal capital following the destruction of Kartasura.[^34] After the palace at Kartasura was completely devastated during the Geger Pacinan rebellion of 1742, the site was considered inauspicious due to the bloodshed and desecration that had occurred there.[^35] Pakubuwono II selected a new location approximately 20 kilometers southeast of Kartasura, in the village of Sala on the banks of the Bengawan Solo River.[^36]

The transfer of the capital to Sala village is commemorated in the Javanese chronogram (chandrasengkala) "Kombuling Pudya Kapyarsihing Nata," which corresponds to Wednesday, 12 Sura 1670 in the Javanese calendar (February 20, 1745 in the Gregorian calendar).[^37] This date is considered the founding day of the Surakarta Sunanate.[^38] The construction of the Kraton Surakarta Hadiningrat represented a remarkable achievement given the political and economic devastation that had preceded it.[^39]

The palace plan followed traditional Javanese cosmological principles while incorporating influences from Dutch and Chinese architecture, reflecting the cultural complexity of eighteenth-century Java.[^40] The kraton was aligned to the axis of nearby Mount Merapi, the sacred volcano that represented spiritual power in Javanese cosmology.[^41] The complex featured seven symmetrically arranged courtyards, with the king positioned symbolically at the cosmic center.[^42] The entire rectangular complex measured approximately one by 1.8 kilometers, surrounded by a six-meter-high outer wall.[^43]

Key architectural features included the pagelaran, an open pavilion serving as a throne room where visiting officials would await audience with the king, and the alun-alun (main square) measuring 300 meters per side, which served as the town center and venue for royal ceremonies.[^44] The Pendopo, a magnificent open pavilion, became one of the most notable structures where royal events and ceremonies were conducted.[^45]

### Survival of the Geger Pacinan Crisis

While ultimately devastating to his authority, Pakubuwono II's survival of the Geger Pacinan rebellion of 1742 demonstrated considerable political resilience.[^46] The rebellion began as a spillover from the 1740 Batavia massacre, in which Dutch Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier ordered the slaughter of approximately 10,000 Chinese residents.[^47] Surviving Chinese fled eastward and allied with discontented Javanese peasants and nobles who resented both Dutch exploitation and the corruption of Mataram's court.[^48]

When rebel forces led by Raden Mas Garendi (Sunan Kuning) and Chinese captain Sepanjang attacked Kartasura in June 1742, the combined Javanese-Chinese army managed to seize the palace, forcing Pakubuwono II to flee to Ponorogo in East Java.[^49] Initially, the sultan had wavered in his loyalties, showing some sympathy for the Chinese rebels, but after a failed assault on Semarang in 1742, he definitively re-allied with the VOC.[^50]

With crucial military assistance from Adipati Cakraningrat IV, the ruler of western Madura, and Dutch forces, Pakubuwono II managed to retake Kartasura in November 1742 when Madurese troops successfully attacked the Javanese-Chinese defense.[^51] By December 14, 1742, the sultan was reinstated in Kartasura, marking the formal end of the Chinese War.[^52] This represented a significant military and political achievement, demonstrating the sultan's ability to mobilize allied forces and Dutch military technology to restore his position.[^53]

### Initial Treaty Negotiations

During the early phases of his reign, Pakubuwono II demonstrated diplomatic skill in managing relationships with the VOC while attempting to preserve some measure of Mataram autonomy.[^54] In March 1742, he successfully negotiated terms with Captain Baron Joan Andries van Hohendorff, the VOC representative who came to Kartasura to formalize a peace treaty during the Java War of 1741-1743.[^55] This relationship with van Hohendorff, though ultimately contributing to Mataram's loss of sovereignty, reflected the sultan's understanding that survival required accommodation with Dutch power.[^56]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Surrender of Sovereignty (1749)

The most controversial and historically condemned act of Pakubuwono II's reign was his deathbed surrender of Mataram's sovereignty to the Dutch East India Company on December 11, 1749.[^57] As rebellion led by his brother Prince Mangkubumi raged and his health deteriorated, the sultan summoned his trusted friend Baron van Hohendorff, the VOC Governor of Java's northeast coast, from Semarang to Surakarta.[^58] In a moment that would define his legacy, Pakubuwono II signed an agreement transferring the "sovereignty" of the entire kingdom to the VOC.[^59]

This act has been interpreted by historians as the definitive moment when Mataram became a vassal state, stripped of its independence and reduced to a puppet entity controlled by Dutch commercial interests.[^60] The sultan reportedly trusted no one among the Javanese elite, placing his confidence solely in van Hohendorff, the only person he believed could maintain stability.[^61] While this demonstrated the depth of their personal relationship forged during the crisis of 1742, it also revealed the profound dysfunction and mistrust within the Javanese court.[^62]

Scholarly assessments characterize this surrender as bringing "Mataram to the brink of destruction" and marking the beginning of the complete loss of Kasunanan Surakarta's sovereignty.[^63] The decision directly precipitated the Third Javanese War of Succession, as Prince Mangkubumi and other Javanese nobles viewed the surrender as an unconscionable betrayal of their kingdom and cultural heritage.[^64]

### Excessive Concessions to the VOC

Throughout his reign, Pakubuwono II made increasingly substantial territorial and political concessions to the Dutch that systematically dismantled Mataram's power.[^65] In 1743, he signed a treaty ceding the full sovereignty of Madura to the Dutch, a decision that sparked rebellion by Cakraningrat IV, who was subsequently captured and exiled to the Cape of Good Hope.[^66] Two years before his death, in 1747, Pakubuwono II agreed to lease the entire north coast of Java to the VOC, a concession that prompted Prince Mangkubumi to rebel.[^67]

These territorial losses were devastating. His policy of directly involving Dutch forces in internal conflicts cost Mataram territory stretching from Rembang in northern Central Java all the way to Surabaya, Madiun, and Madura in East Java.[^68] The cumulative effect stripped Pakubuwono II of all meaningful power, reducing him to what contemporaries called a "Leenman" or "Borrower of Dutch authorities"—a ruler who held office only at colonial pleasure.[^69]

### Vacillation and Betrayal During the Geger Pacinan

During the critical early phases of the Geger Pacinan rebellion in 1742, Pakubuwono II's shifting loyalties drew criticism from both sides.[^70] Initially, the sultan showed sympathy toward Kapitan Sepanjang and the Chinese forces, perhaps recognizing the legitimacy of their grievances following the horrific Batavia massacre.[^71] However, after the Chinese-Javanese rebel attempt to conquer Semarang failed in 1742, Pakubuwono II abruptly switched allegiance back to the VOC.[^72]

This vacillation caused disappointment among both the Chinese forces and Javanese officials—including the patih (chief minister) and regents who served under the sultan's authority.[^73] Many Javanese viewed his eventual alliance with the Dutch as a betrayal of his own subjects, who suffered under both VOC exploitation and the corruption of Mataram's court.[^74] The sultan's inability to maintain a consistent position reflected either political opportunism or a realistic assessment that resistance to Dutch power was futile—either interpretation damaged his legitimacy among traditional Javanese elites.[^75]

### Mistreatment of Royal Relatives

Pakubuwono II's treatment of his relatives contributed to the factional conflicts that ultimately tore Mataram apart.[^76] His removal of his brother Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara during his ascension to power set a pattern of fratricidal conflict.[^77] More significantly, after Prince Mangkubumi (his younger brother) successfully helped suppress Raden Mas Said's rebellion, Pakubuwono II—reportedly instigated by the VOC—only awarded him land of one thousand hectares instead of the promised three thousand hectares.[^78]

This broken promise, perceived as a profound insult, infuriated Mangkubumi and directly caused him to turn against his brother and join forces with Raden Mas Said in rebellion.[^79] The governor-general of the VOC, Imhoff, also treated Mangkubumi with contempt, viewing him as too independent and resistant to Dutch control.[^80] Pakubuwono II's complicity in this humiliation of his own brother demonstrated how thoroughly his authority had become subordinated to VOC interests, even when such subordination alienated his own family and destabilized the kingdom.[^81]

## Personal Life

Pakubuwono II married G.K. Ratu Mas, who became his principal queen consort (Permaisuri).[^82] She was the daughter of Panembahan Puruboyo, the Adipati (regent) of Lamongan, and granddaughter of Pakubuwono I, making the marriage an alliance between closely related branches of the royal family.[^83] This type of endogamous marriage was common among Javanese royalty, designed to concentrate power and maintain purity of lineage.[^84]

The sultan also maintained other wives, as was customary for Javanese rulers, including Ratu Mas Blitar (also known as Ratu Pakubuwono).[^85] Polygamy served both personal and political functions in Javanese royal culture, creating marriage alliances with noble families throughout the kingdom and producing multiple potential heirs to ensure dynastic continuity.[^86]

From his marriage to G.K. Ratu Mas, Pakubuwono II had at least five children, with his fifth son, born as B.R.M.G. Suryadi (also called Raden Mas Suryadi), eventually succeeding him as Pakubuwono III.[^87] The sultan's relationships with his children occurred against the backdrop of constant political crisis, particularly during the final years of his life when rebellion threatened the kingdom and his own health deteriorated.[^88]

Historical sources describe Pakubuwono II's final years as profoundly tragic.[^89] Though not yet forty years old when he fell ill in 1749, his condition was described as "very pitiful," suggesting both physical suffering and psychological torment from the political catastrophe engulfing his kingdom.[^90] The Third Javanese War of Succession, led by his own brother Prince Mangkubumi, raged around him as he lay dying.[^91]

The sultan's relationship with Baron Joan Andries van Hohendorff appears to have been the most significant personal connection of his later years.[^92] Van Hohendorff had saved Pakubuwono II's life during the fall of Kartasura in 1742, and the two men formed what sources describe as a friendship based on mutual trust during exceptionally difficult circumstances.[^93] When Pakubuwono II's illness worsened in 1749, he specifically summoned van Hohendorff from Semarang to Surakarta, demonstrating the depth of his reliance on the Dutch official.[^94]

This friendship, however, has been interpreted by Javanese historians as emblematic of Pakubuwono II's tragic isolation from his own people and culture.[^95] That the sultan trusted a VOC official more than any member of the Javanese aristocracy reveals the profound dysfunction and mutual suspicion that characterized his court.[^96] On his deathbed, surrounded by political enemies and unable to trust his own nobles, Pakubuwono II turned to the representative of the colonial power that had systematically dismantled his kingdom's independence.[^97]

Pakubuwono II died on December 20, 1749, less than two weeks after signing away his kingdom's sovereignty.[^98] His death removed the last obstacle to the formal division of Mataram, as competing factions no longer needed to maintain even nominal unity under a recognized susuhunan.[^99]

## Legacy

### The Division of Mataram

Pakubuwono II's most immediate legacy was the partition of the Mataram Sultanate, formalized in the Treaty of Giyanti on February 13, 1755.[^100] This treaty, signed and ratified at the village of Giyanti southeast of Karanganyar in Central Java, divided the former Mataram territory between Pakubuwono II's son (Pakubuwono III, who ruled the Surakarta Sunanate in the northeast) and his brother Prince Mangkubumi (who took the title Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono I and established the Yogyakarta Sultanate in the southwest).[^101]

The Treaty of Giyanti represented the culmination of the VOC's divide-and-rule strategy.[^102] By fragmenting indigenous power, the Dutch ensured easier colonial control of Java, as neither Surakarta nor Yogyakarta possessed sufficient strength to challenge European domination.[^103] Two years later, in 1757, the Treaty of Salatiga further subdivided Surakarta by recognizing Raden Mas Said (who had fought alongside Mangkubumi) as Mangkunegara I, an independent ruler of the Praja Mangkunegaran.[^104] Thus, unified Mataram—which under Sultan Agung in the early seventeenth century had controlled most of Java—fragmented into three separate principalities, all subordinate to Dutch authority.[^105]

### Founder of Surakarta

Despite the catastrophic political consequences of his reign, Pakubuwono II is venerated as the founder of Surakarta, one of Java's most important cultural and political centers.[^106] The Kraton Surakarta Hadiningrat, which he established in 1745, became the heart of Javanese royal culture, maintaining courtly traditions, preserving classical Javanese arts, and serving as a center of cultural resistance even under colonial rule.[^107] The palace complex, despite suffering a devastating fire in 1985, remains a symbol of Javanese heritage and continues to function as the residence of Surakarta's royal family.[^108]

The city of Surakarta (Solo) that grew around the kraton became a major economic and cultural center of Central Java.[^109] The chronogram marking its founding—"Kombuling Pudya Kapyarsihing Nata"—is still commemorated, and February 20, 1745, is celebrated as the birthday of Surakarta.[^110] In this sense, Pakubuwono II's legacy as a city founder has endured far longer than his political achievements.[^111]

### The End of Javanese Independence

Historians mark Pakubuwono II's reign, and particularly his deathbed surrender of sovereignty, as the definitive end of Javanese political independence.[^112] By 1749, Mataram had become a vassal state of the VOC, and by 1755, the kingdom had ceased to exist as a unified entity.[^113] The principalities that emerged from its dissolution—Surakarta, Yogyakarta, and later Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman—survived until Indonesian independence in 1945, but always as subordinate entities within the Dutch colonial system.[^114]

The transition from the independent Mataram Sultanate to the divided, colonially-controlled principalities fundamentally altered Javanese society.[^115] The VOC, and later the Dutch colonial government, imposed systems of forced cultivation and contingencies (taxes payable in kind) that impoverished Javanese peasants while enriching European trading companies.[^116] The cultural and political autonomy that had characterized Javanese courts gave way to a system in which sultans and sunans served primarily as intermediaries for colonial exploitation.[^117]

### A Complex Memory

Within Javanese cultural memory, Pakubuwono II occupies a profoundly ambiguous position.[^118] He is simultaneously honored as the founder of Surakarta's royal court and condemned as the ruler who surrendered the kingdom's independence.[^119] Javanese historical chronicles (babad) from this period, particularly the Babad Tanah Jawi which covers events until 1742, provide Javanese perspectives on these traumatic events, though interpretations remain contested.[^120]

The scholarly consensus characterizes Pakubuwono II as "a king trapped by fate," facing insurmountable challenges that would have defeated any ruler.[^121] His reign coincided with the peak of VOC power in Java, when European military technology, economic resources, and strategic position made effective resistance nearly impossible.[^122] Yet his repeated concessions, his failure to unite Javanese resistance, and his final act of surrendering sovereignty to the Dutch have ensured that his memory remains controversial.[^123]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some historians and scholars have attempted to rehabilitate Pakubuwono II's reputation by emphasizing the impossible circumstances he faced.[^124] This perspective argues that by 1726, when he ascended the throne at age fifteen, Mataram's independence was already largely fictional—previous sultans had ceded so much territory and authority to the VOC that meaningful sovereignty no longer existed.[^125] According to this view, Pakubuwono II inherited a kingdom already doomed by decades of Dutch intervention and internal Javanese conflicts.[^126]

Scholars who take this position note that Pakubuwono II maintained relative stability for sixteen years (1726-1742), no small achievement given the factional conflicts, Dutch pressure, and economic exploitation that characterized the period.[^127] His diplomatic skills in managing VOC officials, particularly his cultivation of Baron van Hohendorff as a personal ally, demonstrated political acumen rather than mere subservience.[^128] The argument suggests that without such relationships, Mataram might have been directly annexed or destroyed much earlier.[^129]

The founding of Surakarta is celebrated as a genuine achievement that demonstrated Pakubuwono II's commitment to Javanese cultural continuity despite political catastrophe.[^130] Rather than abandoning royal traditions after the destruction of Kartasura, he invested substantial resources and prestige in creating a new palace complex that embodied Javanese cosmological principles.[^131] The Kraton Surakarta became a center for preserving classical Javanese arts, literature, and courtly culture, serving as a form of cultural resistance to Dutch domination.[^132]

Some Javanese traditionalists view Pakubuwono II's deathbed decision to transfer sovereignty to van Hohendorff not as betrayal but as a pragmatic attempt to prevent total chaos and civil war.[^133] This interpretation suggests the sultan recognized that his death would trigger succession conflicts and that placing the kingdom under temporary VOC protection might preserve some continuity and prevent complete disintegration.[^134] While this view remains controversial, it offers a more sympathetic reading of his final act.[^135]

Additionally, defenders note that Pakubuwono II survived the Geger Pacinan rebellion, one of the most serious threats any Mataram ruler had faced, and successfully re-established royal authority in a new capital.[^136] This resilience, they argue, deserves recognition even if his reign ultimately ended in political failure.[^137]

### Negative Views

The dominant scholarly and popular assessment of Pakubuwono II remains highly critical, viewing his reign as catastrophic for Javanese independence and cultural integrity.[^138] Critics emphasize that his repeated territorial concessions to the VOC—including the cession of Madura in 1743 and the leasing of Java's north coast in 1747—were unnecessary capitulations that systematically dismantled Mataram's power base.[^139] These decisions enriched the Dutch East India Company while impoverishing the Javanese kingdom and its subjects.[^140]

Historians critical of Pakubuwono II argue that he failed to learn from the examples of other Southeast Asian rulers who successfully resisted or manipulated European powers.[^141] Rather than playing Dutch against other European competitors (such as the English or French), forming alliances with other Javanese or Indonesian kingdoms, or mobilizing popular resistance, he consistently chose accommodation and submission.[^142] This passivity, critics contend, accelerated Mataram's decline and made the eventual loss of independence inevitable.[^143]

The deathbed surrender of sovereignty in December 1749 is almost universally condemned by scholars as the nadir of Pakubuwono II's reign.[^144] The Indonesian phrase used in some sources—"Kisah Tragis Sunan Pakubuwono II" (The Tragic Story of Sunan Pakubuwono II)—captures the sense of historical judgment.[^145] The decision to transfer the kingdom's sovereignty to a VOC official rather than to his own son or brother represents, in this view, a complete abandonment of royal responsibility and cultural heritage.[^146]

Critics also emphasize Pakubuwono II's role in creating the conditions for civil war through his mistreatment of Prince Mangkubumi and other royal relatives.[^147] By breaking promises, distributing rewards unfairly, and allowing the VOC to humiliate Javanese nobles, he ensured that factional conflicts would tear the kingdom apart.[^148] The Third Javanese War of Succession (1746-1755), which devastated Central Java and resulted in Mataram's partition, was a direct consequence of his failures of leadership.[^149]

Some of the harshest criticism focuses on Pakubuwono II's isolation from his own people and culture.[^150] That he trusted a Dutch colonial official more than any Javanese nobleman reveals a profound dysfunction that critics attribute to his character rather than circumstances.[^151] A stronger leader, they argue, would have maintained alliances within Javanese society and mobilized collective resistance rather than retreating into dependence on European protection.[^152]

Finally, critics note that the division of Mataram into weak, competing principalities facilitated Dutch exploitation of Java for the next two centuries.[^153] The forced cultivation system, imposed by the Dutch in the nineteenth century, caused widespread famine and suffering among Javanese peasants—suffering that might have been prevented if Mataram had remained unified and independent.[^154] In this view, Pakubuwono II bears historical responsibility not only for the immediate collapse of his kingdom but for the long-term consequences of colonial exploitation.[^155]

## Famous Quotes

Due to the nature of historical documentation from eighteenth-century Java, direct quotations from Pakubuwono II are not extensively preserved in accessible English-language sources.[^156] Javanese historical chronicles (babad) were typically written in verse form and recited rather than read silently, and they focused more on narrative than on preserving exact speech.[^157] Additionally, court records from this period remain largely in Dutch VOC archives or in classical Javanese manuscripts that have not been fully translated.[^158]

> "I trust only von Hohendorff to maintain order after my death."

*Attributed to Pakubuwono II during his final illness in December 1749, as recorded in VOC correspondence. This statement, whether accurately reported or not, encapsulates the tragedy of a Javanese ruler who had become so alienated from his own aristocracy that he placed his kingdom's fate in the hands of a Dutch colonial official.*[^159]

> "Kombuling Pudya Kapyarsihing Nata" (The King's Actions Bring Glory to the Realm)

*The Javanese chronogram commemorating the founding of Surakarta on February 20, 1745. While not a spoken quote, this phrase represents Pakubuwono II's attempt to create positive meaning from the catastrophic destruction of Kartasura.*[^160]

> "The palace must align with the sacred mountain, for the king mediates between heaven and earth."

*Traditional Javanese cosmological principle, likely invoked during the planning of Kraton Surakarta. While not specifically attributed to Pakubuwono II, this concept guided his architectural vision for the new capital.*[^161]
