## Summary

Philo Farnsworth was an American inventor who developed the first fully electronic television system. He conceived the idea of electronic television at age 14 while plowing a field and demonstrated the first electronic television image in 1927. Despite his pioneering work, he lost patent battles with RCA and David Sarnoff and received little financial benefit from his invention.
