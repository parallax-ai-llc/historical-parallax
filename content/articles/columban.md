## Summary

Columban (Columbanus) was an Irish missionary who was one of the most important figures in re-Christianizing Western Europe during the early Middle Ages. He founded influential monasteries at Luxeuil in France and Bobbio in Italy. His strict monastic rule and his confrontations with Frankish bishops and royalty demonstrated the independent spirit of Celtic Christianity. He is considered one of the founders of Western monasticism alongside Benedict.
