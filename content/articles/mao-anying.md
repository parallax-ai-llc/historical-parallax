## Summary

Mao Anying (October 24, 1922 – November 25, 1950) was a Chinese military officer and the eldest son of Mao Zedong and Yang Kaihui[^1]. Educated in the Soviet Union and a veteran of World War II, he served as a deputy politics department commander of a tank platoon for the 1st Belorussian Front, participating in battles across Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the final Battle of Berlin[^2]. After returning to China in 1946, he engaged in land reform work before volunteering for service in the Korean War, where he was killed in action by an American air strike on November 25, 1950[^3]. His death at age 28 eliminated what many viewed as the most viable heir to Mao Zedong's leadership, preventing the establishment of a dynastic succession in China[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Mao Anying was born on October 24, 1922, at Central South University Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, Hunan Province, as the eldest son of Mao Zedong and Yang Kaihui[^5]. His early childhood was marked by the tumultuous revolutionary period in China, with his father deeply involved in the Communist movement. His mother, Yang Kaihui, was Mao Zedong's second wife and a dedicated Communist Party member[^6].

The defining trauma of Mao Anying's childhood came on November 14, 1930, when his mother was executed by the Kuomintang at the age of 29[^7]. Yang Kaihui had been captured by Hunan Provincial Government chairman He Jian and was given the option to publicly renounce Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, but she refused despite threats of torture and execution, choosing to be beheaded rather than betray her principles[^8]. At only eight years old, Mao Anying witnessed his mother's capture and subsequently became an orphan amid the anti-communist purges targeting families associated with the Communist Party[^9].

Following their mother's execution, Mao Anying and his younger brother Mao Anqing escaped to Shanghai, where they were enrolled in the Datong Kindergarten, which was run covertly by the Chinese Communist Party for the children of CCP leaders and operated by Dong Jianwu under the alias "Pastor Wang"[^10]. However, in 1933, after the Kuomintang expulsion of the CCP from the Jiangxi Soviet, support for the kindergarten dried up, and the two brothers ended up living as street urchans on the streets of Shanghai under KMT governance[^11]. They endured extreme poverty, living as vagrants who begged for food, scavenged scraps, and slept on pavements[^12]. Tragically, their youngest sibling Mao Anlong succumbed to dysentery in 1931 at age four, further compounding the hardship faced by the two surviving brothers[^13].

This period of destitution lasted until 1936, when Mao Anying was located by Dong Jianwu and Kang Sheng and taken to Moscow, where he was enrolled with his brother Anqing at Interdom (the International Children's Home) in the Soviet Union under the Russian name "Sergei Yun Fu"[^14]. Educated in the Interdom boarding school with the children of other international communists, Anying acquired fluency in Russian and became thoroughly immersed in Soviet culture[^15]. During their stay in the Soviet Union, Mao Anying studied diligently and excelled in his studies, becoming fluent in Russian, French, English, and German[^16].

## Rise to Prominence

Mao Anying's path to prominence began with his extensive education in the Soviet Union. He attended the Ivanovsky International Children's Home, the Lenin Military-Political Academy, and the prestigious Frunze Military Academy[^17]. In 1943, he graduated from both the Frunze Military Academy and the Lenin Military-Political Academy, receiving elite military training that would shape his future career[^18].

During World War II, Mao Anying demonstrated remarkable initiative and dedication to the anti-fascist cause. On June 22, 1941, shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he volunteered to join the Red Army[^19]. However, his initial application in May 1942 was denied, leading him to take the extraordinary step of appealing directly to Joseph Stalin via a personal letter[^20]. His persistence paid off when, after his father Mao Zedong gave permission, his wish was finally granted in 1944[^21].

Serving in the role of zampolit (deputy politics department commander) of a tank platoon, Mao Anying fought with distinction on the Eastern Front, making it all the way through the territories of Poland and Germany during the Red Army's advance[^22]. He participated in some of the most significant battles of World War II's final phase, including operations in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the final Battle of Berlin[^23]. His military service extended to the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation against Japanese forces, where he was praised for his role during military operations in Chahar Province and the Greater Khingan Range[^24]. For his contributions, he received the Soviet military decorations of the Order of the Red Star and the Medal "For Battle Merit"[^25].

In late 1945, with World War II concluded, Mao Anying returned to China, arriving in Yan'an in January 1946[^26]. Mao Zedong had his son fly back to Yan'an, reportedly worried that Anying had become more Russian than Chinese after a decade in the Soviet Union[^27]. Upon his return, Mao Zedong required his son to undergo ideological re-education through direct engagement with China's revolutionary struggle, particularly the agrarian revolution that was central to the Communist movement[^28].

Dressed in his father's worn cotton-padded clothes and trousers to symbolize equality with laborers, Anying performed menial tasks such as farming and production work at sites like Wujia Zaoyuan near Yan'an, eschewing privileges associated with his lineage to foster proletarian consciousness[^29]. Mao Zedong required him to take part in farming practices in the village, where he slept on heatable adobe sleeping platforms, ate roughage, and did farm work the same as the peasants[^30]. From March 1947 to April 1948, Anying extended this experience by joining the Central Land Reform Working Group, participating in efforts to redistribute land from landlords to tenants in rural districts, which reinforced CCP principles of class struggle and agrarian reform as foundational to revolution[^31].

## Major Achievements

Mao Anying's major achievements were primarily military in nature, spanning two major conflicts on different continents. His service in World War II stands as one of his most significant contributions to the anti-fascist struggle. As one of the few Chinese nationals to serve in the Red Army's European campaign, he participated in the liberation of Eastern Europe from Nazi occupation[^32]. His combat experience in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany, culminating in the Battle of Berlin, demonstrated both personal courage and commitment to international communist solidarity[^33].

His receipt of the Order of the Red Star and the Medal "For Battle Merit" during the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation testified to his competence as a military officer[^34]. These decorations were not honorary gestures but recognition of actual combat performance in military operations against Japanese forces in Chahar Province and the Greater Khingan Range[^35]. His multilingual abilities—fluency in Russian, French, English, and German—made him an invaluable asset for international coordination and communication[^36].

Upon returning to China, Mao Anying's participation in land reform work from 1947 to 1948 represented a significant contribution to the Chinese Communist Party's revolutionary program[^37]. The land reform movement was essential to mobilizing peasant support for the Communist cause during the Chinese Civil War, and Anying's willingness to work alongside peasants rather than exploit his status as Mao Zedong's son demonstrated the egalitarian principles the Party claimed to represent[^38]. His direct involvement in redistributing land from landlords to tenants helped implement one of the CCP's core policy objectives and provided him with firsthand understanding of China's rural conditions[^39].

In October 1949, shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mao Anying married Liu Siqi on October 15, 1949[^40]. This marriage represented not just a personal achievement but also symbolized the new generation of Communist China's leadership. The couple had been in love for more than two years before their marriage, having met in 1946[^41]. Before their marriage, Chairman Mao emphasized prudence and genuine compatibility, stating: "Time is the touchstone for testing love. It is okay to fall in love, but if you get married, you have to wait a little longer. Stay together for a while and learn more about each other"[^42].

When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, Mao Anying requested to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) as an officer[^43]. Despite opposition from PVA commander Peng Dehuai and other high-ranking officers who feared Mao Zedong's reaction if his favorite son were killed in combat, Mao Anying insisted on serving[^44]. He was ultimately assigned to Peng Dehuai as his secretary and Russian translator, working under the pseudonym "Secretary Liu" at the PVA headquarters, located in caves near an old gold mining settlement in Tongchang County[^45]. His linguistic skills, particularly his fluency in Russian, made him essential for coordinating with Soviet advisors and managing communications with Moscow[^46].

## Controversies and Criticisms

The circumstances surrounding Mao Anying's death have been the subject of intense controversy and debate for over seven decades. The most contentious issue involves the so-called "egg fried rice" story, which has become a flashpoint in Chinese historical discourse and internet culture[^47]. According to some accounts, on the morning of November 25, 1950, Mao Anying, alongside staff officers Gao Ruixun and Cheng Pu, cooked egg fried rice for breakfast in the office of Peng Dehuai, despite orders to cook only at night for fear of American air raids[^48]. It is alleged that a U.S. pilot spotted the smoke from their cooking and dropped a napalm bomb, killing him and Gao Ruixin in the explosion[^49].

The Chinese Academy of History, a state-run institute established in 2019, has vehemently denounced the fried rice story as rumors spread by those with "vicious hearts" aiming to "gravely dwarf the heroic image of Mao Anying's brave sacrifice"[^50]. The academy, citing declassified documents, stated Mao's position was compromised through intercepted radio transmissions, not cooking smoke[^51]. They argue that Americans were able to combine aerial reconnaissance with the direction of radio waves to identify the headquarters' location[^52].

Despite official pushback, the term "egg fried rice" has become a code word used by some Chinese netizens to celebrate Mao Anying's death, which they believe saved China from adopting a hereditary leadership system similar to North Korea's[^53]. November 25 is sometimes referred to as "Egg Fried Rice Day" or "Chinese Thanksgiving Day" by those who consider the day to signify unexpected good fortune because power didn't fall into the hands of Mao's son[^54]. This phenomenon has led to what are known as "egg fried rice protests," a form of internet protest used by Chinese users occurring yearly around October 24 (Anying's birthday) or November 25 (the date of his death)[^55].

The controversy has resulted in censorship and political repercussions. In 2021, authorities detained a man in China's Jiangxi province over a "fried rice" comment on a Korean War movie[^56]. In 2023 and 2024, a famous Chinese chef faced accusations of mocking Mao after posting egg fried rice tutorials around the anniversary of Mao Anying's death, leading to the deletion of social media content and widespread online criticism[^57][^58].

Another criticism concerns the decision to allow Mao Anying to serve in the Korean War at all. Peng Dehuai and other high-ranking officers had long opposed allowing Mao to join the PVA, fearing the consequences if the Chairman's son were killed[^59]. The fact that Anying was assigned to headquarters rather than kept safely in China suggests either poor judgment or political pressure that prioritized symbolic value over practical risk management[^60]. Some historians believe that Peng Dehuai's fall from grace after the Great Leap Forward and further humiliation during the Cultural Revolution was due at least in part to Mao Zedong's hatred for Peng's carelessness in protecting the life of his son[^61].

Questions have also been raised about the delayed notification of Mao Zedong regarding his son's death. Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Yang Shangkun ordered the Central Military Commission and Politburo not to inform Mao Zedong immediately after Peng Dehuai reported Mao Anying's death[^62]. Mao was finally informed by a communication from Zhou Enlai and Peng Dehuai in January 1951, about five weeks after the death, with Zhou and Peng explaining "Because at that time you all had colds" as the reason for the delay[^63]. This patronizing decision to withhold information from the nation's leader raises ethical questions about transparency and respect for Mao Zedong's right to know about his son's fate[^64].

## Personal Life

Mao Anying's personal life was marked by tragedy, resilience, and ultimately, brief happiness before his untimely death. His relationship with Liu Siqi represents one of the few periods of personal stability in his tumultuous life. The two met in 1946 and had been in love for more than two years before their marriage on October 15, 1949[^65]. Mao Anying said to Liu Siqi: "You lost your father when you were young, and I lost my mother. We are both in the revolutionary era, and we are both two bitter children in the country's difficult times"[^66]. This shared experience of loss and hardship formed a strong bond between them.

Their marriage lasted exactly one year, from October 15, 1949, to October 15, 1950, when Mao Anying departed for the Korean War[^67]. In her later years, Liu Siqi recalled: "Our marriage is destined to be only a short one year fate, from October 15, 1949 to October 15, 1950, not a day more, a day not a lot, a whole year"[^68]. On the evening of October 14, 1950, Mao Anying went to the hospital to visit his wife Liu Siqi, who was hospitalized for appendicitis[^69]. He joined the Volunteer Army without consulting her, telling her: "Tomorrow I'm going on a business trip far away, where communication is inconvenient. If you don't receive my letter, please don't worry, there will be news in a while"[^70]. This would be their final meeting.

Mao Anying's personality combined idealism with pragmatism, international sophistication with revolutionary dedication. His multilingual abilities and cosmopolitan education in the Soviet Union gave him a worldview that transcended narrow nationalism, yet he remained committed to the Chinese revolutionary cause[^71]. His willingness to undergo manual labor and live among peasants despite his privileged position as Mao Zedong's son demonstrated genuine commitment to egalitarian principles rather than mere political performance[^72].

His relationship with his father was complex. Having been separated from Mao Zedong during most of his childhood and adolescence—first by circumstance on the streets of Shanghai, then by design in the Soviet Union—their reunion in 1946 required both to rebuild a father-son relationship[^73]. Mao Zedong's insistence that Anying undergo "re-Sinification" through rural labor suggests both paternal concern about his son's cultural identity and political calculation about grooming a suitable heir[^74].

After Mao Anying's death, Liu Siqi initially resisted remarrying. When Mao Zedong urged her to remarry, she responded: "Anying went to North Korea without my knowledge and never returned, and I ended up not even seeing his bones, not even visiting his grave, so how could I possibly consider remarriage?"[^75] Under Mao's care and repeated persuasion, Liu Siqi finally established a happy family with Yang Maozhi, an instructor at the Air Force Aviation Academy, in 1962, twelve years after Mao Anying's sacrifice[^76]. Mao Zedong said to Liu Siqi, "Don't be estranged from your father's love in the future, you are not my daughter-in-law, but still my daughter!"[^77] After marriage, she named her eldest son Xiaoying to commemorate her first husband[^78].

## Legacy

Mao Anying's legacy is profoundly tied to what he prevented rather than what he accomplished. His death at age 28 in the Korean War eliminated what many viewed as the most viable heir to Mao Zedong's leadership, preventing the establishment of a dynastic succession in China[^79]. In the words of one analysis, "When Anying died, he took with him the possibility of a new Mao dynasty"[^80]. This single event may have fundamentally altered the trajectory of Chinese political development, ensuring that China did not follow the path of North Korea, where the Kim family has maintained hereditary rule for three generations[^81].

The absence of Anying intensified Mao Zedong's reliance on non-familial protégés for succession planning, contributing to the instability of post-Mao transitions[^82]. Without a dynastic heir, Mao designated figures like Lin Biao as successors in the 1960s, but these choices unraveled amid purges and the Cultural Revolution[^83]. The succession struggles that plagued China's leadership in the 1970s might have been avoided had Mao Anying survived to provide a clear line of succession, though this alternative history assumes he would have possessed the political acumen and revolutionary credentials to maintain power.

In official Chinese historiography, Mao Anying is portrayed as a dedicated revolutionary and martyr, embodying filial piety to the communist cause through his voluntary service in the Korean War and ultimate sacrifice[^84]. The ideology, morality, and style of the exemplary communists embodied by Mao Zedong and Mao Anying are still remembered and admired by hundreds of millions of people, and remain a valuable spiritual asset for building core socialist values today[^85]. His burial in Pyongyang, in the Cemetery for the Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, symbolizes the internationalist dimension of China's revolutionary struggle and the sacrifice made in support of North Korea[^86].

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery in Hoechang County, South Pyongan Province, North Korea, is the largest Chinese People's Volunteers cemetery in North Korea at 90,000 square metres, housing the remains of 134 Chinese People's Volunteer Army dead from the Korean War, including those of Mao Anying[^87]. Construction was completed in 1957 and was visited by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1958[^88]. Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea, laid a wreath at the cemetery's CPV monument on July 27, 2023, the 70th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement which ended hostilities of the Korean War[^89].

However, Mao Anying's legacy remains contested in contemporary China. The ongoing "egg fried rice protests" and the sensitivity of Chinese authorities to any mockery of his sacrifice indicate that his death continues to serve as a proxy battleground for debates about Mao Zedong's leadership, the Korean War's significance, and the nature of political succession in China[^90]. The fact that Chinese censors actively delete fried rice references and detain individuals who make jokes about his death demonstrates the political stakes involved in controlling his historical narrative[^91].

In 1959, nine years after Mao Anying's death, his wife Liu Siqi proposed to Chairman Mao that Mao Anying's body be moved back to China for burial[^92]. Chairman Mao responded by saying he should remain buried "at the green mountain," meaning he should stay in North Korea alongside other Chinese volunteers who gave their lives[^93]. This decision to leave him buried abroad rather than repatriate his remains reinforced the message that Mao Anying was to be remembered as an ordinary soldier rather than the Chairman's privileged son.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and official Chinese historians view Mao Anying as an exemplary revolutionary who embodied the highest ideals of Communist internationalism and personal sacrifice. His service in both World War II against Nazi Germany and the Korean War against American-led forces demonstrates a consistent commitment to anti-imperialism across different theaters and contexts[^94]. Scholars sympathetic to this view emphasize that he volunteered for dangerous combat assignments when he could have remained in comfortable positions due to his father's status[^95].

His participation in land reform work is seen as evidence of genuine dedication to egalitarian principles rather than exploitation of privilege[^96]. By living among peasants, performing manual labor, and experiencing the hardships of rural life, Mao Anying gained authentic understanding of the masses he claimed to serve—a sharp contrast to many revolutionary leaders' children who have historically used family connections for personal advancement[^97]. This grassroots experience would have made him a more legitimate and capable leader had he survived.

The official narrative emphasizes his educational achievements and military decorations as evidence of merit-based advancement rather than nepotism[^98]. His graduation from the prestigious Frunze Military Academy and Lenin Military-Political Academy, along with his receipt of the Order of the Red Star and Medal "For Battle Merit," are presented as honors earned through competence and courage, not family connections[^99]. The fact that he received Soviet decorations for service in the Red Army demonstrates that his contributions were recognized by foreign allies based on performance, not Chinese political favoritism.

Some scholars argue that his death represented a tremendous loss of potential leadership for China. With his international education, combat experience, multilingual abilities, and commitment to revolutionary principles, Mao Anying possessed a unique combination of qualifications that few of his generation could match[^100]. Had he survived and eventually assumed leadership, he might have been better positioned to navigate China's opening to the West in the 1970s, given his familiarity with Western languages and European culture acquired during his Soviet education.

### Negative Views

Critics and revisionist historians offer a far more skeptical assessment of Mao Anying's significance and the circumstances of his death. The "egg fried rice" controversy, whether factually accurate or not, has become a symbol for questioning the official narrative of heroic sacrifice[^101]. Skeptics argue that if Mao Anying and other officers indeed violated basic security protocols by cooking during daylight hours despite explicit orders, it demonstrates fatal incompetence that cost lives unnecessarily[^102].

Some historians view his appointment to Peng Dehuai's headquarters as fundamentally an act of nepotism that placed political symbolism above military effectiveness[^103]. Peng Dehuai and other commanders opposed Mao Anying's deployment precisely because they recognized the political complications that would arise if the Chairman's son were killed[^104]. The fact that he was assigned to serve in a war zone despite these objections suggests that Mao Zedong's personal wishes overrode sound military judgment, putting both Anying and potentially the broader war effort at risk.

The delayed notification to Mao Zedong about his son's death is seen by some as evidence of a dysfunctional political culture where even the supreme leader could not be trusted with basic information about his own family[^105]. Zhou Enlai's paternalistic decision to withhold news of Anying's death for five weeks, ostensibly because Mao had a cold, reveals the extent to which China's leadership operated through personal relationships and arbitrary judgments rather than transparent procedures[^106].

Critics note that Mao Anying's brief life prevented him from facing the moral tests that challenged his father and other Communist leaders[^107]. He died at 28 before the catastrophic failures of the Great Leap Forward, the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, or the practical compromises of economic reform. It remains unknown whether he would have possessed the moral courage to oppose his father's disastrous policies or would have become complicit in mass violence and ideological extremism[^108]. The assumption that he would have been a better leader than those who actually succeeded Mao Zedong is essentially unfalsifiable speculation.

Some Chinese netizens who celebrate November 25 as "Egg Fried Rice Day" or "Chinese Thanksgiving Day" argue that Mao Anying's death was fortuitous for China because it prevented the establishment of a hereditary dictatorship similar to North Korea's Kim dynasty[^109]. From this perspective, whatever Mao Anying's personal virtues or qualifications, the principle of hereditary succession in a supposedly communist society would have represented a fundamental betrayal of egalitarian ideals[^110]. His death, tragic on a personal level, may have served China's long-term interests by forcing a more meritocratic (or at least non-dynastic) succession process.
