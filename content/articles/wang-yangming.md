## Summary

Wang Yangming was a Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher, military strategist, and statesman who developed the idealist school of Neo-Confucianism. He challenged Zhu Xi's rationalism with his doctrine of the 'unity of knowledge and action' — that true knowledge necessarily leads to moral action. His concept of 'innate moral knowledge' (liangzhi) argued that every person possesses an innate ability to distinguish right from wrong. His philosophy profoundly influenced Chinese, Korean, and Japanese thought.
