## Summary

Gustav Kirchhoff was a German physicist who made fundamental contributions to electrical circuits, spectroscopy, and the understanding of blackbody radiation. His Kirchhoff's circuit laws are essential to electrical engineering. Together with Robert Bunsen, he pioneered the technique of spectroscopy, discovering the elements cesium and rubidium. His work on blackbody radiation posed the problem that led to quantum theory.
