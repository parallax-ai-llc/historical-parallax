## Summary

Alexei Leonov performed the first spacewalk (extravehicular activity) in history on March 18, 1965, spending 12 minutes outside the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. He nearly died when his spacesuit inflated in the vacuum of space and he had to partially depressurize it to re-enter the airlock. He later commanded the Soviet side of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975.
