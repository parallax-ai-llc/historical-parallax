## Overview

The Beslan school siege (September 1-3, 2004) was the deadliest school shooting/siege in history. Chechen terrorists occupied School No. 1 in Beslan, Russia, on the "Day of Knowledge" (first day of school), taking 1,100 hostages (teachers, parents, and children). For three days, hostages were held in a sweltering gym without water or food, surrounded by tripwire bombs. The siege ended in a chaotic, bloody storming by Russian special forces. 334 people were killed, including 186 children. The tragedy hardened Vladimir Putin's rule and changed Russia's security policies.

### Day 2: The Standoff (September 2)
