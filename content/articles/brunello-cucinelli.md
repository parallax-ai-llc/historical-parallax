## Summary

Brunello Cucinelli is an Italian fashion designer and entrepreneur known as the 'King of Cashmere.' He founded Brunello Cucinelli S.p.A. in 1978, building a luxury fashion house specializing in cashmere clothing. His humanistic approach to capitalism — paying above-market wages, limiting work hours, and restoring the medieval village of Solomeo — made him a model of ethical luxury business. Cucinelli went public in 2012 and became one of the fastest-growing luxury brands.
