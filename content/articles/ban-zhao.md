## Summary

Ban Zhao (班昭, 45-117 CE) was one of the most influential female scholars in ancient Chinese history, serving as imperial historian, philosopher, poet, and educator during the Eastern Han Dynasty. She completed her brother Ban Gu's monumental historical work, the *Book of Han* (*Han Shu*), after his death, becoming the first known female historian in Chinese history[^1]. Most famously, she authored *Lessons for Women* (*Nü Jie*), a controversial Confucian instructional text that both elevated women's education and reinforced patriarchal norms that would influence Chinese society for nearly two millennia[^2]. As court instructor to Empress Deng Sui and the palace women, Ban Zhao wielded considerable intellectual and political influence in the imperial court, representing a rare example of female authority in ancient China[^3].

## Early Life and Background

Ban Zhao was born around 45 CE in Anling (present-day Xianyang, Shaanxi Province) into the prestigious Ban family, one of the most distinguished scholarly lineages of the Eastern Han Dynasty[^4]. Her family background was exceptional: her father, Ban Biao, was a renowned historian and philosopher who began compiling historical records of the Western Han Dynasty[^5]. Her eldest brother, Ban Gu, continued their father's work and became the principal compiler of the *Book of Han*, while her second brother, Ban Chao, achieved fame as a military general and diplomat who reopened the Silk Road trade routes to Central Asia[^6].

Growing up in this highly intellectual environment, Ban Zhao received an education extraordinary for a woman of her era[^7]. While formal education was typically reserved for males in Han Dynasty China, her father recognized her exceptional intelligence and permitted her to study classical texts, history, mathematics, and astronomy alongside her brothers[^8]. She demonstrated remarkable aptitude for classical scholarship, mastering Confucian classics, historical writing, poetry, and philosophy at a young age[^9].

The Ban family's scholarly tradition traced back several generations, creating an atmosphere where learning was paramount[^10]. Ban Zhao's grandfather had also been a scholar-official, establishing a family culture that valued intellectual achievement[^11]. This privileged upbringing provided Ban Zhao with access to extensive libraries and contact with leading scholars of the day, opportunities virtually unprecedented for a Chinese woman of her time[^12].

At approximately fourteen years old, following conventional practice for elite families, Ban Zhao was married to Cao Shishu, a local official from Anling[^13]. Historical records suggest the marriage was relatively brief, as Cao Shishu died while Ban Zhao was still young, leaving her a widow[^14]. Rather than remarrying, as was common, Ban Zhao chose to remain a widow and dedicate herself to scholarship and raising her children, a decision that would prove pivotal to her later achievements[^15]. Her status as a respectable widow from an elite family would later grant her unique access to the imperial court as an instructor to palace women, a role no married woman could have filled[^16].

## Rise to Power

Ban Zhao's rise to prominence began in the aftermath of personal tragedy. When her brother Ban Gu was imprisoned and died in 92 CE before completing the *Book of Han*, Emperor He summoned Ban Zhao to the imperial court to finish this monumental historical project[^17]. This appointment was unprecedented—never before had a woman been officially commissioned to work as an imperial historian[^18]. The *Book of Han* was a comprehensive history of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 9 CE), covering over two centuries and requiring mastery of complex historical materials, astronomical calculations, and classical writing styles[^19].

Ban Zhao spent several years completing the unfinished sections of the *Book of Han*, particularly the difficult astronomical and mathematical treatises that had challenged even her brother[^20]. She not only finished the work but also edited and revised sections her brother had completed, demonstrating superior scholarship[^21]. Emperor He was so impressed with her erudition that he retained her at court and appointed her as *Cao Dajia* (曹大家), meaning "Venerable Madam Cao," an honorific title reflecting her elevated status[^22]. Court officials and scholars began referring to her respectfully as "Madam Cao" rather than by her personal name[^23].

Her scholarly reputation grew rapidly within the imperial court. The complexity of the astronomical and calendrical sections she completed required advanced mathematical knowledge that few scholars possessed[^24]. She became known for her ability to clarify obscure classical references and resolve textual disputes among male court scholars[^25]. The renowned scholar and educator Ma Rong, one of the most influential Confucian scholars of the era, formally acknowledged Ban Zhao as his teacher and studied classical texts under her guidance—a remarkable reversal of gender roles that testified to her exceptional mastery[^26].

Ban Zhao's influence expanded beyond historical scholarship when Empress Deng Sui ascended to power as regent in 106 CE following the death of Emperor He[^27]. Empress Deng appointed Ban Zhao as chief instructor to herself and all women of the imperial palace, responsible for teaching Confucian classics, history, proper conduct, and palace protocol[^28]. This position gave Ban Zhao unprecedented access to political power, as she effectively controlled the education and ideological formation of the empire's most influential women[^29].

As the empress's trusted advisor and teacher, Ban Zhao wielded considerable political influence during Empress Deng's regency[^30]. Court documents indicate she was consulted on matters of state policy, particularly those involving ritual propriety and classical precedent[^31]. When Empress Deng faced political challenges from rival court factions, Ban Zhao provided crucial support and counsel, helping to stabilize the regency[^32]. Her position allowed her to influence the selection and education of palace women who would become consorts and mothers of future emperors, extending her impact across generations[^33].

## Major Achievements

Ban Zhao's most enduring scholarly achievement was completing the *Book of Han* (*Han Shu*), one of China's most important historical texts and the second of the Twenty-Four Histories that form the official historical record of imperial China[^34]. The work consists of 100 chapters covering 229 years of history, including imperial biographies, treatises on government institutions, astronomy, geography, and literature, plus biographical accounts of notable officials and commoners[^35]. The sections Ban Zhao completed—particularly the astronomical treatise (*Tian Wen Zhi*) and the tables of nobility—were considered among the most technically demanding portions requiring advanced mathematical and astronomical knowledge[^36].

The *Book of Han* established the format and methodology for official historical writing that would be followed for the next two thousand years[^37]. Ban Zhao's completion of this work ensured its preservation and influence, making her contributions fundamental to Chinese historiographical tradition[^38]. Modern scholars have identified her distinctive writing style in several sections, noting her particular attention to documenting the lives and contributions of women, which was unprecedented in official historical writing[^39]. She included more biographical accounts of women—including empresses, consorts, and notable female figures—than any previous official history, establishing a model for recognizing women's historical roles[^40].

Her second major achievement was composing *Lessons for Women* (*Nü Jie*), a seven-chapter instructional manual on feminine conduct and education written around 106 CE[^41]. This text became one of the most influential works on women's education and conduct in Chinese history, remaining required reading for educated women until the early 20th century[^42]. The work covered humility, resignation, subservience, self-abasement, obedience, cleanliness, and industry as essential feminine virtues[^43]. Paradoxically, while the content emphasized female subordination to male authority, the very existence of the text and its intellectual sophistication demonstrated that women were capable of high-level scholarship and moral reasoning[^44].

*Lessons for Women* was revolutionary in explicitly arguing that women should receive formal education—a radical position in Han Dynasty China[^45]. Ban Zhao contended that women needed education to fulfill their family duties properly, to educate their own children, and to serve as moral guides within the household[^46]. She wrote: "Yet only to teach men and not to teach women—is that not ignoring the essential relation between them?"[^47] This argument, though framed within conservative values, opened possibilities for female literacy and learning that had previously been denied[^48].

As imperial tutor, Ban Zhao educated multiple generations of palace women, including Empress Deng Sui, who became one of the most capable and powerful regents in Han Dynasty history[^49]. Under Ban Zhao's instruction, Empress Deng mastered classical texts, history, and governance, enabling her to rule effectively during her regency from 106-121 CE[^50]. The empress frequently consulted Ban Zhao on political matters and credited her teacher with shaping her understanding of statecraft and Confucian governance principles[^51].

Ban Zhao also made significant contributions to poetry and prose literature. She composed numerous poems and essays, though most have been lost to history[^52]. Her surviving poems demonstrate mastery of classical forms and sophisticated literary techniques[^53]. One famous work, "Traveling Eastward" (*Dong Zheng Fu*), was a poetic essay written to comfort her daughter who was traveling far from home to marry, showcasing Ban Zhao's emotional depth and literary artistry[^54]. The poem reveals both her adherence to conventional filial duties and her personal anguish at family separation[^55].

Her role in advocating for her brother Ban Chao demonstrated political acumen and rhetorical skill. When her elderly brother, serving as military commander in the Western Regions, petitioned the emperor for permission to return home but was denied, Ban Zhao submitted a memorial to the throne arguing eloquently for his recall[^56]. Her petition successfully persuaded Emperor He to allow Ban Chao's return, showcasing her ability to influence imperial policy through written argument[^57]. The memorial is studied as an example of effective persuasive writing and proper bureaucratic communication[^58].

Ban Zhao established methodological innovations in historical writing, particularly in her treatment of sources and emphasis on verification[^59]. She insisted on consulting multiple sources before accepting historical claims and developed systematic approaches to evaluating contradictory accounts[^60]. These methods influenced subsequent generations of Chinese historians and contributed to the development of critical historical scholarship in China[^61].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Ban Zhao's *Lessons for Women* has generated intense controversy and criticism, particularly from modern feminist scholars who view it as a fundamental text of Chinese patriarchal oppression[^62]. The work explicitly teaches women to accept subordinate status, to practice self-abasement before husbands and in-laws, and to endure mistreatment without complaint[^63]. Ban Zhao wrote: "Let a woman modestly yield to others; let her respect others; let her put others first, herself last"[^64]. Critics argue that this text provided ideological justification for female oppression that persisted for nearly two millennia, making Ban Zhao complicit in systemic gender inequality[^65].

The doctrine of "three obediences" (*san cong*) that Ban Zhao reinforced—obedience to father before marriage, to husband during marriage, and to sons in widowhood—institutionalized female subordination throughout a woman's entire life[^66]. Modern critics argue that as an educated, influential woman who herself exercised considerable autonomy and authority, Ban Zhao hypocritically advocated restrictions she did not personally observe[^67]. Her own life—remaining unmarried as a widow, pursuing scholarship, holding official court positions, and wielding political influence—contradicted the submissive ideal she prescribed for other women[^68].

Some scholars contend that *Lessons for Women* actually represented a conservative backlash against increasing female autonomy during the Han Dynasty[^69]. During this period, empresses and empress dowagers frequently exercised political power, and women from elite families enjoyed relative freedom compared to later dynasties[^70]. Ban Zhao's text may have sought to reimpose stricter Confucian gender hierarchy precisely because existing practices had become more liberal[^71]. From this perspective, her work was reactionary rather than progressive, attempting to reverse trends toward greater female agency[^72].

The emphasis on female self-abasement and humility in *Lessons for Women* has been particularly condemned. Ban Zhao wrote that women should practice self-deprecation and consider themselves inferior, stating: "humility means yielding and acting respectful, putting others first and oneself last, never mentioning one's own good deeds or denying one's own faults"[^73]. Critics argue this psychological conditioning of women to internalize inferiority caused profound psychological harm across generations[^74].

Ban Zhao's influence on Neo-Confucian gender ideology has also drawn criticism. Later Confucian scholars during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) built upon her work to develop even more restrictive norms for women, including the intensification of foot-binding practices and stricter seclusion of women[^75]. While Ban Zhao did not advocate these specific practices, critics argue her theoretical framework provided the foundation for increasingly oppressive measures[^76].

Some historians have questioned whether Ban Zhao actually completed as much of the *Book of Han* as traditionally credited to her, suggesting that later scholars may have exaggerated her contributions to create a model of acceptable female scholarship that didn't threaten male authority[^77]. This skepticism, while controversial, reflects broader questions about how women's historical contributions have been remembered and potentially constrained by patriarchal narratives[^78].

Ban Zhao's failure to use her position and influence to advocate for broader female rights represents another criticism. Despite her unprecedented access to imperial power through Empress Deng, there is no evidence she advocated for legal reforms to improve women's status, property rights, or protection from abuse[^79]. Instead, she reinforced existing hierarchies and encouraged female acceptance of subordination[^80].

The contradiction between advocating female education while simultaneously limiting its purpose has also drawn critique. Ban Zhao argued women should be educated, but only to better serve their families and husbands, not for personal development or independent thought[^81]. This instrumental view of female education—as a tool for more effective subordination—has been condemned as ultimately reinforcing rather than challenging gender oppression[^82].

## Personal Life

Ban Zhao married Cao Shishu when she was approximately fourteen years old, following the conventional practice for elite families during the Han Dynasty[^83]. Little is recorded about her husband, who was a local official from Anling, suggesting the marriage was typical for someone of her social class[^84]. Historical sources provide few details about their relationship, though traditional accounts describe it as harmonious[^85]. The marriage produced at least one daughter and possibly other children, though exact numbers and details remain unclear in historical records[^86].

Cao Shishu died while Ban Zhao was still relatively young, making her a widow probably in her twenties or early thirties[^87]. In Han Dynasty China, widows faced strong social pressure to either remarry or, if from elite families, to remain chaste in honor of their deceased husbands[^88]. Ban Zhao chose the latter path, never remarrying and dedicating herself to scholarship and raising her children[^89]. Her decision to remain a widow proved crucial to her later career, as her status as a respectable widow allowed her to work in the imperial court and interact with male scholars in ways that would have been impossible for a married woman[^90].

She maintained a close relationship with her daughter throughout her life. When her daughter married and moved far from home, Ban Zhao composed the touching poem "Traveling Eastward," expressing both her maternal sorrow at the separation and her daughter's duty to serve her new husband's family[^91]. The poem reveals the emotional tension Ban Zhao experienced between maternal affection and adherence to Confucian family obligations: "Now you are departing to go to your family far away / I think back on your childhood with heart full of sadness"[^92]. This work demonstrates that despite her advocacy for female subordination, Ban Zhao experienced genuine emotional conflicts regarding women's prescribed roles[^93].

Historical accounts describe Ban Zhao as possessing a humble and retiring personality, at least in her public demeanor[^94]. She was known for avoiding ostentation and maintaining proper decorum according to Confucian principles[^95]. Court records indicate she dressed modestly and observed strict protocol, never seeking to draw attention to herself despite her scholarly achievements[^96]. This personal modesty aligned with the values she espoused in *Lessons for Women* and may have made her acceptable to conservative court officials who might otherwise have resented female authority[^97].

Her relationships with her brothers were clearly important to her life and work. She deeply respected her elder brother Ban Gu and honored his memory by completing his historical work[^98]. Her petition to the emperor on behalf of her brother Ban Chao demonstrated both sibling loyalty and confidence in her own rhetorical abilities[^99]. After Ban Chao returned from the Western Regions, historical records suggest the siblings maintained close contact until his death in 102 CE[^100].

As a teacher, Ban Zhao was reportedly patient and thorough, earning the respect and affection of her imperial students[^101]. Empress Deng Sui maintained a close relationship with her teacher throughout Ban Zhao's life, visiting her during illnesses and seeking her counsel on both personal and political matters[^102]. This relationship suggests Ban Zhao possessed not only intellectual capability but also interpersonal skills that enabled her to navigate the dangerous political environment of the imperial court[^103].

Despite her public advocacy for female humility, Ban Zhao evidently possessed considerable self-confidence and intellectual pride, as demonstrated by her willingness to instruct male scholars like Ma Rong[^104]. She must have recognized her own exceptional abilities to accept such a role, suggesting a more complex personality than her writings on female subordination might imply[^105]. This contradiction has led some scholars to speculate that her personal beliefs may have been more nuanced than her published works suggest, though direct evidence is limited[^106].

Ban Zhao lived to approximately seventy years of age, dying around 117 CE during the reign of Emperor An[^107]. Historical records indicate she remained mentally sharp and continued her scholarly work until near the end of her life[^108]. Her death was mourned at the imperial court, and she received honors unusual for a woman of her era, reflecting the respect she had earned through her scholarship and service[^109].

## Legacy

Ban Zhao's legacy is profoundly paradoxical, embodying both the possibilities and limitations of female achievement within patriarchal systems. As the first known female historian in Chinese history, she broke barriers that demonstrated women's intellectual capabilities, yet her most influential written work reinforced gender hierarchies that constrained women's opportunities for nearly two millennia[^110]. This duality has made her a complex and contested figure in Chinese cultural memory[^111].

The *Book of Han* remains one of the most important historical texts in Chinese civilization, still studied by scholars today for its comprehensive account of the Western Han Dynasty[^112]. Ban Zhao's contributions ensured the work's completion and influenced its final form, making her an integral part of China's historiographical tradition[^113]. The methodological approaches she employed in historical writing—particularly her emphasis on source verification and critical evaluation—influenced subsequent generations of Chinese historians[^114]. Her inclusion of more extensive material on women's lives established a precedent that later historians occasionally followed, though never consistently[^115].

*Lessons for Women* became one of the most widely distributed and influential texts in Chinese history, reprinted countless times and included in standard educational curricula for girls from elite families through the late Qing Dynasty (early 20th century)[^116]. The work was incorporated into the Confucian canon of female education alongside similar texts like *Precepts for Women* by Song Ruoxin and *Analects for Women* (*Nü Lunyu*), forming a trilogy of works that shaped female education for centuries[^117]. Every educated woman in traditional China for over eighteen centuries would have read or been taught Ban Zhao's principles[^118].

The text was not confined to China; it spread throughout East Asia, influencing gender norms in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam[^119]. Japanese editions appeared during the Heian period (794-1185 CE), and the work became part of female education among the samurai class[^120]. Korean Confucian scholars adopted Ban Zhao's principles as guides for proper feminine conduct, reinforcing similar patriarchal structures in Korean society[^121]. This regional influence extended Ban Zhao's impact far beyond Chinese borders[^122].

During China's modern transformation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ban Zhao became a focal point of debate about women's roles and traditional values. May Fourth Movement intellectuals and early Chinese feminists in the 1910s-1920s explicitly rejected *Lessons for Women* as representative of the feudal oppression they sought to overthrow[^123]. Reformers like Chen Duxiu and Lu Xun criticized the text as emblematic of traditional teachings that had crippled Chinese women's development[^124]. Ban Zhao's work became symbolic of everything modern China needed to abandon[^125].

Conversely, cultural conservatives during the Republican period (1912-1949) upheld Ban Zhao as a model of proper feminine virtue and scholarship operating within appropriate bounds[^126]. This debate over Ban Zhao's legacy reflected larger conflicts about Chinese modernization, gender equality, and the value of traditional culture[^127]. The Communist Party after 1949 officially condemned *Lessons for Women* as feudal ideology while acknowledging Ban Zhao's historical significance as a scholar who completed the *Book of Han*[^128].

In contemporary times, Ban Zhao's legacy has undergone reassessment. Some modern Chinese and Western scholars have adopted more nuanced interpretations, arguing that Ban Zhao should be understood within her historical context rather than judged by modern standards[^129]. They note that her advocacy for female education, even if limited, represented a progressive position for her era and created openings that later reformers could expand[^130]. Her own life demonstrated possibilities for female achievement that contradicted dominant gender norms[^131].

Feminist scholars remain divided. Some view Ban Zhao as a tragic figure—a brilliant woman whose talents were constrained by her society, leading her to rationalize and reinforce the system that oppressed her[^132]. Others see her as an active agent who made deliberate choices to secure power and influence by accommodating patriarchal values, making her complicit in gender oppression[^133]. A third perspective interprets her work as containing subtle subversions, arguing that by insisting women needed education and demonstrating female intellectual capacity, she planted seeds that would eventually undermine the very hierarchy she appeared to endorse[^134].

Her influence on establishing the legitimacy of female scholarship, however constrained, cannot be dismissed. By proving that a woman could master classical learning and contribute to the highest levels of intellectual work, Ban Zhao created a precedent that could not be entirely erased[^135]. Later exceptional female scholars like Li Qingzhao (Song Dynasty poet), Xue Tao (Tang Dynasty poet), and others could point to Ban Zhao as historical proof that women were capable of scholarly achievement[^136].

The contradiction between her life and her teachings continues to generate scholarly interest. Recent academic works have produced dozens of studies examining this paradox from various angles—psychological, sociological, literary, and historical[^137]. Ban Zhao remains relevant precisely because she embodies fundamental tensions about women's agency, complicity, resistance, and survival within oppressive systems—questions that retain contemporary relevance[^138].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers and defenders of Ban Zhao emphasize her extraordinary scholarly achievements and her courage in entering domains previously closed to women. The classical scholar Wang Zhong (1745-1794) praised her as "the most learned woman of ancient times," noting that her completion of the *Book of Han* demonstrated intellectual capabilities equal to the finest male scholars[^139]. Traditional Chinese scholars honored her as one of the "Four Great Women of Virtue and Talent" alongside other exemplary figures from Chinese history[^140].

Modern historians who specialize in Han Dynasty studies acknowledge Ban Zhao's genuine contributions to historical methodology and textual scholarship. Professor Michael Loewe, a leading Western authority on the Han period, has written that Ban Zhao's completion of the astronomical and mathematical sections of the *Book of Han* required "technical expertise of the highest order" that few contemporaries possessed regardless of gender[^141]. Her work ensured the preservation of crucial historical knowledge that might otherwise have been lost[^142].

Some feminist scholars offer qualified defenses of Ban Zhao by emphasizing historical context. Professor Dorothy Ko argues that judging Ban Zhao by modern feminist standards is anachronistic and fails to recognize the constraints she faced[^143]. Within her historical context, Ban Zhao's advocacy for female education—even if limited to domestic purposes—represented a progressive position that challenged complete female exclusion from learning[^144]. By arguing that women needed education to fulfill their roles properly, she created an opening that subsequent generations could expand[^145].

Defenders note that *Lessons for Women* explicitly states in its introduction that Ban Zhao wrote it late in life out of concern for her daughters' welfare, not as a universal prescription[^146]. Some scholars interpret this as suggesting her advice was situation-specific rather than ideological, aimed at helping women survive and navigate a patriarchal system she could not change[^147]. From this perspective, Ban Zhao was providing practical survival strategies rather than endorsing ideal gender relations[^148].

Chinese literary scholars praise her poetry and prose as demonstrating sophisticated artistry and emotional depth. Professor Kang-i Sun Chang includes Ban Zhao among significant early Chinese women writers whose work "displays remarkable literary sophistication and thematic complexity"[^149]. Her poem "Traveling Eastward" is studied as an example of how female writers navigated the tension between personal emotion and social obligation[^150].

Historians of science credit Ban Zhao with preserving and explicating astronomical and mathematical knowledge in the *Book of Han* that provides crucial evidence for understanding ancient Chinese scientific thought[^151]. Her work on the astronomical treatise has been analyzed by historians of Chinese astronomy as demonstrating sophisticated understanding of calendrical systems and celestial observation[^152].

Some scholars argue that Ban Zhao's relationship with Empress Deng Sui contributed to an era of relatively effective and benevolent governance. Empress Deng's reign as regent is generally assessed positively by historians, with policies that provided famine relief, reduced taxes, and promoted Confucian learning[^153]. Ban Zhao's role in educating the empress may have contributed to these outcomes, representing indirect but real political influence used beneficially[^154].

Contemporary scholars in China have reassessed Ban Zhao more favorably as part of efforts to recover and honor female historical figures. She appears in educational materials, museum exhibitions, and popular media as an example of historical female achievement[^155]. This rehabilitation reflects both nationalist pride in Chinese civilization and evolving views on gender that can accommodate more complex assessments of historical figures[^156].

### Negative Views

Critics of Ban Zhao focus primarily on her role in codifying and perpetuating patriarchal gender ideology through *Lessons for Women*. The prominent Chinese intellectual Lu Xun (1881-1936) condemned traditional female instruction texts including Ban Zhao's work as instruments of oppression that "ate people" by destroying women's autonomy and humanity[^157]. Modern feminist scholars have characterized *Lessons for Women* as "one of the most influential texts in the history of Chinese women's oppression"[^158].

Professor Lisa Raphals has criticized the "fundamental contradiction" between Ban Zhao's personal life—characterized by scholarship, political influence, and public authority—and her prescriptions for other women, which emphasized submission, domesticity, and self-abasement[^159]. This hypocrisy, critics argue, is particularly damaging because it allowed Ban Zhao to enjoy privileges while advocating their denial to other women[^160].

Feminist historians point out that Ban Zhao had unprecedented access to political power through her relationship with Empress Deng but apparently used none of it to advocate for improvements in women's legal status, property rights, or protection from abuse[^161]. Unlike some later women in positions of influence who attempted to use their power to benefit other women, Ban Zhao appears to have been concerned solely with maintaining her personal position and reinforcing existing hierarchies[^162].

The doctrine of female self-abasement that Ban Zhao promoted has been identified by psychologists and sociologists as contributing to internalized oppression that made resistance to patriarchy psychologically difficult for Chinese women[^163]. By teaching women to view themselves as inherently inferior and to accept mistreatment as natural, *Lessons for Women* created psychological barriers to challenging gender inequality[^164].

Some historians question whether Ban Zhao's scholarship was genuinely her own work or whether male relatives and collaborators deserved more credit than traditional accounts acknowledge[^165]. While this skepticism may itself reflect gender bias, it raises questions about how women's achievements in patriarchal societies are remembered and potentially either exaggerated or diminished to serve particular narratives[^166].

Critics note that the very existence of *Lessons for Women* may have been necessary for Ban Zhao to maintain her position—that she could only exercise authority by constantly reaffirming that she was an exception and that other women should not follow her example[^167]. This interpretation paints Ban Zhao as someone who purchased personal privilege by betraying other women, making her complicit in systemic oppression[^168].

The long-term influence of *Lessons for Women* in legitimizing practices like foot-binding (though Ban Zhao herself never advocated this specific practice), extreme seclusion of women, and denial of female education beyond basic domestic skills has been emphasized by critics[^169]. Neo-Confucian scholars in later dynasties cited Ban Zhao's authority to justify increasingly restrictive measures against women[^170].

Modern Chinese feminists have particularly criticized the continued veneration of Ban Zhao in some contexts, arguing that celebrating her perpetuates problematic narratives about acceptable femininity[^171]. They contend that truly honoring women's history requires acknowledging the harm caused by figures like Ban Zhao, not excusing it through historical relativism[^172].

The scholar Bettine Birge has argued that Ban Zhao's emphasis on wifely obedience and family hierarchy contributed to legal developments in subsequent dynasties that progressively worsened women's property rights and autonomy[^173]. By providing ideological justification for female subordination, *Lessons for Women* influenced not just cultural norms but actual legal structures[^174].
