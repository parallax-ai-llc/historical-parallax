## Summary

Charles Martel (c. 688 – October 22, 741), whose surname means "The Hammer" in Old French, was a Frankish political and military leader who served as Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia from 715 to 741 and became the de facto ruler of the Franks from 718 until his death.[^1] He is most famous for his victory at the Battle of Tours in 732, where he defeated the invading Umayyad forces led by Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi, a triumph that many historians credit with halting Islamic expansion into Western Europe.[^2] Charles reunited and ruled the entire Frankish realm, laid the foundations for the Carolingian dynasty through his sons Pepin the Short and Carloman, and is considered instrumental in shaping medieval European feudalism and military organization.[^3] His grandson Charlemagne would go on to become the first emperor in the West since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Charles Martel was born around 688 CE, the illegitimate son of Pepin of Herstal (also known as Pippin II), the powerful Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, and a noblewoman named Alpaida.[^5] By this period in Frankish history, the Merovingian kings had become mere figureheads—"do-nothing kings" (rois fainéants)—while the real power rested with the mayors of the palace who managed the royal household and effectively governed the kingdom.[^6] The Frankish realm was divided into three major regions: Austrasia in the east, Neustria in the west, and Burgundy in the south, each with its own mayor of the palace.[^7]

As an illegitimate son, Charles's prospects initially appeared limited. The assassination of Pippin II's only surviving legitimate son in 714 was followed within months by Pippin's own death, creating a succession crisis.[^8] Rather than naming Charles as his heir, Pippin left his kingdom to his legitimate grandsons, with his widow Plectrude serving as regent.[^9] Viewing the ambitious Charles as a threat to her grandsons' inheritance, Plectrude had him imprisoned.[^10] However, Charles proved resourceful and determined—he escaped from captivity and immediately began gathering supporters to challenge Plectrude's authority.[^11]

The Frankish realm descended into civil war in 715, with various factions vying for control.[^12] The Neustrians, led by their Mayor of the Palace Raganfrid, allied with King Chilperic II to oppose Plectrude's regency and defeated the young Theudoald's forces at the Battle of Compiègne on September 26, 715.[^13] Before the year's end, Charles had been acclaimed as Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia by his supporters, marking the beginning of his rise to power.[^14] During this chaotic period, the Duke of Aquitaine also seized the opportunity to assert independence, fragmenting the Frankish realm further.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Charles Martel's ascent to supreme power in Francia was achieved through a decade of relentless military campaigning and political maneuvering. Between 715 and 717, he focused on consolidating his power in Austrasia, his base of support.[^16] In 716, he achieved his first significant victory against the Neustrians at the Battle of Amblève near Liège.[^17] However, the decisive confrontation came on March 21, 717, at the Battle of Vinchy near Cambrai, where Charles decisively defeated the combined Neustrian and Merovingian forces led by Raganfrid and King Chilperic II.[^18]

The victory at Vinchy marked a turning point, but Charles still faced determined opposition. In 718, Chilperic II attempted to counter Charles's growing dominance by forming an alliance with Odo the Great, the powerful Duke of Aquitaine.[^19] Undeterred, Charles methodically expanded his control, completing the consolidation of Neustria between 718 and 719.[^20] In 718, he also demonstrated his willingness to use military force beyond the Frankish heartland by laying waste to Saxon territories as far as the banks of the Weser River.[^21] By 719, following another decisive victory at Soissons, Charles forced Raganfrid to retreat to Angers and effectively ended organized Neustrian resistance.[^22]

From this point forward, Charles alone governed the Franks as mayor of the palace, though he maintained the fiction of Merovingian royal authority.[^23] Chilperic II, the last Merovingian king to actively oppose the Pippinid family, was forced to acknowledge Charles as Mayor of the Palace of both Neustria and Austrasia, reunifying the fractured Frankish kingdoms.[^24] After Chilperic's death in 718, Charles appointed Chlothar IV as king, and after Chlothar's death, he appointed Theuderic IV.[^25] Significantly, Charles was now appointing the kings whom he supposedly served, and by the end of his reign, he dispensed with the pretense altogether and did not appoint any king at all.[^26]

Between 718 and 732, Charles secured his authority through a series of military campaigns that subdued challenges to his rule.[^27] He faced rebellions from Bavarians, Aquitanians, Saxons, and Alemanni, all of which he successfully suppressed.[^28] His military prowess and political acumen transformed him from an illegitimate son imprisoned by his stepmother into the undisputed master of Francia.[^29]

## Major Achievements

### The Battle of Tours (732)

Charles Martel's most celebrated achievement was his victory at the Battle of Tours (also known as the Battle of Poitiers) on October 10, 732.[^30] The Umayyad Caliphate had conquered most of the Iberian Peninsula by 712, and in subsequent years, Muslim forces had crossed the Pyrenees, establishing a presence in southern Gaul.[^31] By 719, they had taken Narbonne and established Berber settlements in Gothic Gaul, and by 725, Muslim raiding parties were venturing as far north as Burgundy.[^32]

In 731, an army under Charles invaded Aquitaine twice, forcing Duke Odo to recognize Frankish overlordship.[^33] However, when a large Muslim force led by Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi, the governor of al-Andalus, invaded Aquitaine in 732 and defeated Odo, the duke was compelled to seek Charles's assistance.[^34] The two forces met somewhere between Tours and Poitiers in October 732.[^35] Charles commanded a primarily infantry force that adopted a defensive formation, while the Muslim army relied heavily on cavalry.[^36]

According to contemporary chronicles, Charles's forces "remained immobile like a wall, holding together like a glacier in the cold regions."[^37] On the seventh day of confrontation, the Muslims launched their attack, and although their cavalry initially struggled to break through the massed Frankish infantry, they eventually penetrated in several places.[^38] However, during the battle, many Muslim soldiers heard rumors that the Franks were raiding their camp and stealing the plunder they had accumulated, prompting squadrons to ride back to protect their goods.[^39] This movement triggered panic and confusion, with other Muslims believing their comrades were fleeing.[^40] Abd al-Rahman died attempting to stop the chaotic retreat, and the Muslim army withdrew during the night.[^41]

The victory earned Charles the nickname "Martel" (the Hammer), bestowed by ninth-century chroniclers who recorded the outcome as divine judgment in his favor.[^42] Later Christian historians characterized the battle as a decisive turning point that saved Christian Europe from Islamization.[^43] Edward Gibbon and other pre-twentieth-century scholars praised Charles as Christianity's champion and argued that his victory prevented the Umayyad Caliphate from conquering a divided Europe.[^44]

### Military Campaigns and Territorial Expansion

Following Tours, Charles spent the remainder of the 730s consolidating Frankish control over southern territories. In 733, he began campaigns to force Burgundy to yield to his rule, occupying Lyon in southern Burgundy and pressing down the Rhône Valley.[^45] By 737, Charles and his Franks controlled all of Burgundy and Provence, from Orléans south to the Mediterranean.[^46] These campaigns involved fighting both local nobles who resisted Frankish authority and Muslim forces that remained active in Septimania and parts of Provence.[^47]

Charles invaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, though he was ultimately forced to withdraw to Frankish territory.[^48] Recognizing the persistent threats on his southern frontier, he deposed the rebellious noble Maurontus and subjugated Provence.[^49] Between 733 and 735, Charles reorganized the kingdom of Burgundy, replacing counts and dukes with his loyal supporters, thereby strengthening his administrative control.[^50]

In the east and northeast, Charles conducted extensive campaigns against the Saxons, Frisians, and Bavarians throughout the 710s-730s.[^51] In late 718, he ravaged Saxon country to the banks of the Weser, Lippe, and Ruhr rivers.[^52] In 738, he compelled the Saxons of Westphalia to submit and pay tribute.[^53] These campaigns secured the eastern frontiers of the Frankish realm and demonstrated Charles's ability to project military power across vast distances.[^54]

### Institutional and Military Reforms

Charles Martel has been traditionally credited with playing an influential role in developing the Frankish system of feudalism, though modern scholars debate the extent of his innovation.[^55] To support his increasingly cavalry-focused military forces, Charles distributed Church properties to favored vassals in exchange for oaths of loyalty and provision of military service.[^56] Rather than granting lands permanently, he provided them as precarias (leases), ensuring that nobles remained dependent on his favor.[^57] This system of land grants created a network of obligations between lords and vassals that became fundamental to medieval feudal society.[^58]

Heinrich Brunner maintained that Charles laid the foundation for feudalism during the eighth century, arguing that the military reform—transitioning from infantry to more expensive cavalry forces—necessitated providing followers with income-producing lands.[^59] The increased number of cavalry warriors and the attachment of feudal lords to the throne through land tenure significantly strengthened centralized authority.[^60] However, historian Paul Fouracre has challenged this interpretation, suggesting Charles's land distribution was primarily a pragmatic military measure to maintain control rather than a deliberate creation of feudalism.[^61]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Seizure of Church Lands

Charles Martel's relationship with the Church was deeply controversial, particularly his extensive secularization of ecclesiastical properties to fund his military campaigns and reward his followers.[^62] He conferred principal ecclesiastical dignities upon men who were totally unworthy or possessed only military qualifications, such as assigning the episcopal sees of Reims and Trier to Milon, a warrior with no clerical credentials.[^63] These actions generated significant resentment among Church officials and damaged Charles's reputation among religious authorities.[^64]

Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims, writing in the mid-ninth century, developed Charles's reputation as a despoiler of Church lands, using earlier sources to criticize Carolingian rulers of his own time.[^65] Hincmar even related a vision showing Charles suffering in hell as punishment for robbing the Church of its property.[^66] However, recent scholarship has questioned these accounts, with some historians finding no solid evidence to support the more extreme accusations and suggesting they may have been politically motivated exaggerations.[^67]

At one point during the early years of his rule, Charles came close to excommunication for his actions against Church interests.[^68] Nevertheless, he did provide important support to certain Church endeavors: in 723, he offered crucial protection to St. Boniface, the great apostle of Germany, who stated that without Charles's protection he could neither administer his church, defend his clergy, nor prevent idolatry.[^69] Charles also erected four dioceses in Bavaria and gave Boniface authority as metropolitan bishop over all Germany east of the Rhine, with his seat at Mainz.[^70]

### Historical Debate Over the Battle of Tours

Modern historians have engaged in significant debate regarding the actual importance of the Battle of Tours, with many challenging the traditional narrative of Charles as the savior of Christian Europe.[^71] Historian Tomaž Mastnak argues that modern historians have constructed a myth presenting this victory as having saved Christian Europe from the Muslims, when contemporaries of the battle did not overstate its significance.[^72] Chronicles from the mid-eighth century present Tours as merely one of many military encounters between Christians and Saracens rather than a world-historical turning point.[^73]

British medieval historian Paul Fouracre has suggested that the Muslim campaign "should perhaps be interpreted as a long-distance raid rather than the beginning of a war," noting that the Arab force was likely aimed at pillaging the wealthy monastery of St. Martin of Tours rather than conquering the Frankish kingdom.[^74] Recent scholars have pointed out that Tours-Poitiers is poorly recorded in contemporary sources and is not given prominence in Arabic sources from the period, suggesting it was "a construct of western mythmaking."[^75] Furthermore, Muslim incursions into the region continued for years after 732, indicating that the battle did not decisively end the threat.[^76]

Some historians emphasize that internal conflicts within the Umayyad Caliphate—including crushing military defeats at Byzantium and Toulouse, leading to the Berber Revolt of 740 in Iberia and Northern Africa—played equally important roles in limiting Islamic expansion into Western Europe.[^77] The border between Muslim Spain and Christian Frankish territories remained contested throughout Charles's life and beyond.[^78]

### Brutal Treatment of Enemies

Charles has been criticized for the harsh methods he employed against various peoples, particularly the Saxons.[^79] His campaigns of 718 involved laying waste to Saxon territories, and his treatment of defeated enemies was often brutal and oppressive.[^80] The systematic destruction of Saxon settlements and forced submissions through violence established patterns of conflict that would continue under his descendants, particularly Charlemagne's notoriously bloody Saxon wars.[^81]

### Modern Appropriation by Extremist Groups

Charles Martel's memory has been unfortunately appropriated by far-right and white nationalist groups in recent decades, who invoke him as a symbol of European resistance to Islamic influence.[^82] The Charles Martel Group in France and various neo-Nazi movements have claimed his legacy.[^83] Anders Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi who killed 77 people in 2011, claimed to have identified with Charles Martel, as did the Christchurch mosque shooter in 2019.[^84] This modern weaponization of Charles's historical legacy represents a distortion of eighth-century realities and has contributed to Islamophobia and religious hatred.[^85]

## Personal Life

Charles Martel married twice during his lifetime, and his family relationships played crucial roles in the subsequent development of European history.[^86] His first wife was Rotrude of Treves, daughter of either Lambert II, Count of Hesbaye, or Leudwinus, Count of Treves.[^87] This marriage produced five children: Hiltrud, Carloman, Landrade (also called Landres), Auda (also known as Aldana or Alane), and Pepin the Short (also called Pippin).[^88] Hiltrud married Odilo I, Duke of Bavaria, becoming Duchess consort of Bavaria, and later served as regent for her minor son from 748 to 754.[^89]

In 725, Charles married his second wife, Swanhild, a Bavarian princess, though this marriage appears to have been politically motivated to secure alliances in Bavaria.[^90] Beyond his legitimate marriages, Charles also maintained relationships with other women. He had a mistress named Ruodhaid, with whom he had several children including Bernard (born before 732, died 787), Remigius who became archbishop of Rouen (died 771), and Ian (died 783).[^91]

Historical sources provide limited information about Charles's personality and character, focusing primarily on his military and political activities.[^92] The chronicles describe him as a formidable warrior and shrewd political operator who could be ruthless when necessary but also pragmatic in forming alliances.[^93] His willingness to escape imprisonment, his ability to attract and retain loyal followers despite his illegitimate birth, and his success in navigating the treacherous politics of early medieval Francia all suggest a man of considerable charisma, intelligence, and determination.[^94]

Charles divided his realm among his sons without facing opposition, though he notably ignored his young son Bernard in the succession arrangements.[^95] This division reflected both his power—no one dared challenge his decisions—and his pragmatic approach to governance, as dividing the realm among multiple heirs was a common Frankish practice.[^96] Charles died on October 22, 741, at Quierzy-sur-Oise in Francia.[^97] Significantly, he never claimed the title of king, maintaining the legal fiction of Merovingian kingship even as he wielded all real power.[^98]

## Legacy

Charles Martel's legacy profoundly shaped the course of medieval European history, primarily through the Carolingian dynasty he founded and the military and administrative systems he established.[^99] His most immediate legacy was political: he laid the foundations for his son Pepin the Short's rise to the Frankish throne in 751 and his grandson Charlemagne's imperial acclamation in 800.[^100] When Charles divided Francia between his sons Carloman and Pepin in 741, he set in motion the events that would lead to the official establishment of the Carolingian dynasty.[^101]

Pepin became the first king of the Carolingian dynasty in 751 when he deposed the last Merovingian king, Childeric III, and was crowned by Pope Zachary.[^102] This transition from mayor of the palace to king completed the process Charles had begun—the replacement of the ineffectual Merovingian dynasty with vigorous Carolingian leadership.[^103] Pepin's son Charlemagne extended the Frankish realms dramatically and became the first emperor in the West since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, receiving his imperial crown from Pope Leo III on Christmas Day 800.[^104] The Carolingian Renaissance that followed brought significant cultural and intellectual advancements to Europe during the early Middle Ages.[^105]

Charles is credited with stabilizing and strengthening the Frankish realm after the chaos following his father's death, reuniting territories that had fragmented and establishing administrative systems that his successors built upon.[^106] His military victories—not just at Tours but across numerous campaigns against Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians, Aquitanians, and others—secured the borders of Francia and established Frankish dominance across Western and Central Europe.[^107] His system of land grants to loyal warriors laid the foundation for the feudal social order that would shape European society for centuries.[^108]

The cultural and religious impact of Charles's victory at Tours extended beyond the immediate military outcome. The battle reinforced the idea of Christendom as a unified entity with a shared religious and cultural identity that transcended national borders.[^109] It established a model of leadership and military strategy based on the idea of the "Christian knight" as a defender of the faith and homeland, which would shape the development of medieval chivalry and later inspire the Crusades.[^110] Edward Gibbon famously remarked that "the epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has been added to the name of Charles, is expressive of his weighty and irresistible strokes."[^111]

However, Charles's legacy is complex and contested. While he is celebrated as a unifier and defender, his seizure of Church lands and appointment of unqualified clerics created tensions that persisted for generations.[^112] The precedent he set for secular control over ecclesiastical appointments and properties would contribute to ongoing conflicts between Church and state authorities throughout the medieval period.[^113] His military methods, particularly his harsh treatment of the Saxons and other peoples, established patterns of violence and forced conversion that his descendants would continue and intensify.[^114]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and traditional historians have praised Charles Martel as one of the most consequential figures in medieval European history, crediting him with preserving Christian civilization and laying the groundwork for the Carolingian Empire.[^115] Edward Gibbon and other eighteenth and nineteenth-century historians characterized him as the champion of Christianity who prevented the Islamization of Western Europe through his victory at Tours.[^116] This interpretation held that had Charles fallen at Tours, the Umayyad Caliphate would have easily conquered a divided Europe, fundamentally altering the religious and cultural development of the continent.[^117]

Many historians emphasize Charles's remarkable political and military skills, noting his rise from imprisoned illegitimate son to undisputed ruler of Francia as evidence of extraordinary ability.[^118] His capacity to unite the fractured Frankish kingdoms, establish effective administration, conduct successful military campaigns on multiple fronts, and found a dynasty that would dominate Europe for generations demonstrates strategic vision and tactical brilliance.[^119] Even scholars who question the significance of the Battle of Tours acknowledge that Charles himself had a huge effect on Western European history.[^120]

The Catholic Encyclopedia and religious historians have highlighted Charles's crucial support for missionary activities, particularly his protection of St. Boniface, which enabled the Christianization of Germanic territories east of the Rhine.[^121] Without Charles's military protection and political support, the expansion of Christianity into these regions would have been significantly more difficult.[^122] His establishment of dioceses in Bavaria and his authorization of Boniface as metropolitan bishop created ecclesiastical structures that endured for centuries.[^123]

Military historians praise Charles for his innovative tactics and strategic thinking, particularly his effective use of massed infantry formations to defeat cavalry-based armies.[^124] His understanding of defensive positioning, his ability to maintain discipline among his troops during extended confrontations, and his skill at exploiting enemy vulnerabilities all mark him as one of the great military commanders of his era.[^125] The development of a more cavalry-focused Frankish army under his leadership created military capabilities that his successors would employ to great effect.[^126]

### Negative Views

Critics and revisionist historians have challenged many aspects of the traditional heroic narrative surrounding Charles Martel, questioning both his methods and his historical significance.[^127] Modern medievalists increasingly downplay the importance of the Battle of Tours, with some characterizing it as a relatively minor engagement whose significance has been vastly overinflated by later Christian mythmaking.[^128] British historian Paul Fouracre and others argue that the Muslim force was conducting a raiding expedition rather than a conquest, making Charles's victory less strategically significant than traditionally portrayed.[^129]

Historians have criticized Charles harshly for his secularization of Church properties and his appointment of unqualified military men to important ecclesiastical positions.[^130] These actions demonstrated a cynical disregard for religious institutions and spiritual leadership, treating the Church merely as a source of wealth to fund military campaigns and reward political supporters.[^131] Archbishop Hincmar's ninth-century account of Charles suffering in hell, while likely exaggerated for political purposes, reflects genuine contemporary outrage at his treatment of Church properties.[^132]

Scholars examining the sources for Charles's career note that they are "overwhelmingly written with a bias that justifies the end of the Merovingian dynasty," making objective assessment difficult.[^133] The chronicles and histories were largely produced by supporters of the Carolingian dynasty who had obvious interests in portraying Charles heroically and depicting the Merovingians as incompetent.[^134] This source bias means that negative aspects of Charles's rule may have been systematically minimized or omitted from the historical record.[^135]

Critics also point to Charles's brutal military methods, particularly his destructive campaigns against the Saxons, which involved systematic devastation of territory and forced submissions through violence.[^136] These tactics, while effective militarily, caused enormous suffering and established patterns of conflict and forced Christianization that would continue under subsequent Carolingian rulers.[^137] Some modern scholars view Charles's campaigns as early examples of religiously motivated violence and cultural suppression.[^138]

The appropriation of Charles's memory by modern far-right, white nationalist, and Islamophobic movements has led some historians to critically examine how his legacy has been constructed and weaponized.[^139] These scholars emphasize that eighth-century conflicts between Franks and Umayyads were primarily political and territorial rather than civilizational or religious in the absolute terms later interpreters have imposed.[^140] The tendency to view Tours through a lens of Christian versus Muslim conflict oversimplifies the complex political landscape of the period, in which alliances often crossed religious lines and religious identity was less rigidly defined than in later centuries.[^141]
