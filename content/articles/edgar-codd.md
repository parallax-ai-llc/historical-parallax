## Summary

Edgar F. Codd was a British-American computer scientist who invented the relational model for database management, which became the basis for relational databases used worldwide. His 1970 paper 'A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks' transformed how data is stored and accessed. SQL databases, which implement his model, are the backbone of most enterprise data management. He received the Turing Award in 1981.
