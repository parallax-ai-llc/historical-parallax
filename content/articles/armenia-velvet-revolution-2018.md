## Summary

In the spring of 2018, Armenia achieved what seemed impossible: a peaceful revolution with no bloodshed. Over the course of six weeks, hundreds of thousands of citizens took to the streets—walking, singing, blocking roads, shutting down the country. Their target was Serzh Sargsyan, a president who was engineering a constitutional maneuver to extend his rule. Their leader was Nikol Pashinyan, an opposition MP who had walked 200 kilometers from the country's second city to the capital, gathering followers as he went.[^1]

When it was over, Sargsyan had resigned, telling his nation: "I was wrong. Nikol Pashinyan was right." Pashinyan became Prime Minister, riding a wave of hope for a new Armenia—free from corruption, oligarchs, and the post-Soviet malaise that had gripped the country for decades. No one was killed. No buildings were burned. The revolution was called "velvet" because it was so remarkably soft.[^2]

The 2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution stands as one of the most successful peaceful uprisings in recent history—a demonstration that disciplined, nonviolent civil disobedience can still topple entrenched power. Whether the revolution's promise has been fulfilled remains debated, especially after Armenia's disastrous defeat in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. But in those spring days of 2018, Armenians showed the world what people power could look like in the 21st century.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Post-Soviet Armenia

**Independence (1991):**
- Collapse of USSR
- War with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh
- Economic crisis
- Earthquake recovery (1988 disaster)

**Decades of struggle:**
- Armenian victory in Nagorno-Karabakh War (1994)
- But economic stagnation
- Mass emigration
- Oligarchic control of economy
- Democratic backsliding[^4]

### Serzh Sargsyan's Rule

**Sargsyan's career:**
- Karabakh War veteran
- Defense Minister, Prime Minister under predecessor
- President: 2008-2018

**His presidency:**
- Disputed 2008 election: 10 killed in protests
- Consolidated power
- Oligarchs protected
- Critics marginalized
- But some stability maintained

**The 2015 constitutional change:**
- Referendum shifted power from President to Prime Minister
- Sargsyan claimed he wouldn't seek PM role
- **Few believed him**[^5]

### The Trigger

**April 2018:**
- Sargsyan's presidential term ending
- Announced he would become Prime Minister
- Exactly what he had promised not to do
- The move would extend his rule indefinitely

**For many Armenians, this was the final insult.** A president who had already overstayed his welcome was now manipulating the constitution to stay forever.[^6]

## The Revolution

### Phase 1: The March (March 31 - April 13)

**March 31, 2018:**
- **Nikol Pashinyan** began "My Step" campaign

- Planned to walk 200 km to Yerevan over two weeks
- "This will be a revolution of love and solidarity"

**The march:**
- Small at first (few hundred)
- Growing as it progressed
- Villagers joined along the route
- Media coverage increased
- By April 13: Thousands entered Yerevan[^7]

### Phase 2: Yerevan Occupation (April 13-22)

**April 13:**
- Marchers arrived in Yerevan
- Joined by tens of thousands
- Republic Square occupied
- Streets blocked

**April 14:**
- Ruling party nominated Sargsyan for PM
- Protests intensified

**April 16:**
- Pashinyan injured trying to break through police line
- Continued leading protests after treatment

**April 17:**
- Parliament elected Sargsyan as Prime Minister
- Despite massive protests outside
- Rage in the streets[^8]

### Phase 3: Civil Disobedience (April 17-23)

**Pashinyan's strategy:**
- Block everything
- Nonviolent but disruptive
- Target economic pressure points

**Actions:**

**Participation:**
- Not just youth: Families, elderly joined
- Workers, students, professionals

### Phase 4: Sargsyan Falls (April 22-23)

**April 22:**
- Pashinyan and Sargsyan met
- Talks collapsed after 3 minutes
- Sargsyan: "Don't blackmail me"
- Pashinyan arrested

**April 23:**
- Hundreds of thousands in streets
- Army units refused to act against protesters
- Soldiers in some videos welcomed by crowds
- **Serzh Sargsyan resigned**

**His statement:**
> "Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong. The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand."

**Pashinyan released same day.** The revolution had won its first battle.[^10]

### Phase 5: Pashinyan Becomes PM (April 23 - May 8)

**But the ruling party still controlled parliament.**

**April 25:**
- Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) withdrew support from ruling coalition
- Republican Party increasingly isolated

**May 1:**
- Parliament voted on Pashinyan as PM
- **Rejected: 56 against, 45 for**
- Protests resumed with greater intensity

**May 2-7:**
- General strike
- Country effectively shut down
- Even ruling party MPs' relatives pressured them

**May 8:**
- Second parliamentary vote
- **Pashinyan elected: 59 votes**
- Republican MPs abstained or voted yes
- **Victory complete**[^11]

## Death Toll

**Remarkably: Zero**

- No protesters killed
- No police killed
- No revenge violence
- Minimal injuries
- Arrests but quick releases

**Why?**
- Police restraint (eventually)
- Protester discipline
- Quick regime collapse
- No leader willing to order massacre
- International pressure

**The "velvet" nature made this revolution exceptional.**[^12]

## Historical Assessment

**Immediate factors:**
- Sargsyan's obvious constitutional manipulation
- Economic grievances
- Effective leadership
- Disciplined movement

**Structural factors:**
- Civil society stronger than elsewhere in region
- Diaspora pressure
- International connections
- Regime not willing to massacre citizens

### Comparison to Other Movements

| Movement | Violence | Outcome |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Armenia 2018 | None | Successful |
| Ukraine 2014 | 100+ dead | Successful but costly |
| Belarus 2020 | Limited deaths | Failed |
| Georgia 2003 | Minimal | Successful (Rose Revolution) |

**Armenia 2018 was among the most purely nonviolent successful revolutions.**[^16]

### Long-Term Assessment

**Positive:**
- Demonstrated power of nonviolent resistance
- Broke oligarchic control (partially)
- More competitive political system
- Civil society strengthened

**Negative:**
- 2020 military defeat

## Legacy

### For Armenia

**April 23 (Sargsyan's resignation) and April 24 (Armenian Genocide Remembrance) now linked in national memory**

- But complicated by subsequent events
- Generational divide: Youth still hopeful, older generation skeptical

### For the World

**Lessons:**
- Peaceful revolution still possible in 21st century
- Social media can amplify movements
- Leadership matters: Pashinyan's march was crucial
- But revolution is beginning, not end

**Inspiration for:**
- Belarus 2020 (attempted, failed)
