## Summary

Kuroda Nagamasa (1568-1623) was a prominent Japanese daimyō and military commander who served under both Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu during Japan's tumultuous Sengoku and early Edo periods. The son of the renowned strategist Kuroda Yoshitaka (Kanbei), Nagamasa distinguished himself as a fierce warrior and capable administrator, particularly during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, where his decisive support for the Eastern Army helped secure Tokugawa Ieyasu's victory. As a reward for his loyalty, he was granted the vast Fukuoka Domain in Kyushu, worth 520,000 koku, where he supervised the construction of Fukuoka Castle and established policies that would shape the region for generations. Despite his military prowess and administrative achievements, Nagamasa's relationship with his father remained complex and strained, marked by a famous incident involving his father's confinement that continues to generate historical debate.

## Early Life and Background

Kuroda Nagamasa was born on December 3, 1568, in Himeji Castle in Harima Province (modern-day Hyōgo Prefecture), as the eldest son of Kuroda Yoshitaka (also known as Kuroda Kanbei), one of the most brilliant strategists of the Sengoku period[^1]. His mother was identified in some sources as a daughter of the櫛橋 (Kushihashi) family, though details about her remain limited in historical records[^2]. Born into a period of intense warfare and political upheaval, Nagamasa's childhood was shaped by his father's service to various daimyō, including the Kodera clan and later Oda Nobunaga[^3].

The young Nagamasa's early years were marked by a traumatic incident that would define much of his childhood. In 1578, when Nagamasa was approximately ten years old, his father Yoshitaka was sent as a diplomatic envoy to Araki Murashige, a vassal who had rebelled against Oda Nobunaga[^4]. When Yoshitaka failed to return immediately, Nobunaga suspected betrayal and ordered the execution of Nagamasa as hostage insurance. However, Takenaka Hanbei, another of Nobunaga's strategists, secretly hid the boy instead, saving his life[^5]. This incident left Nagamasa separated from his father for an extended period and may have contributed to their later strained relationship.

Nagamasa's education followed the rigorous path expected of samurai sons in the Sengoku period. He received training in military arts, strategy, horsemanship, and the ways of the warrior from an early age[^6]. Unlike his father, who was renowned for his intellectual brilliance and strategic acumen, Nagamasa developed a reputation as a more straightforward military commander, favoring direct action and battlefield courage over complex stratagems[^7]. This difference in temperament would later become a source of tension between father and son.

After Oda Nobunaga's assassination in 1582 at Honnō-ji, the Kuroda family transferred their loyalty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was rapidly consolidating power across Japan[^8]. Young Nagamasa served in various campaigns under Hideyoshi's banner, gaining valuable military experience and beginning to establish his own reputation separate from his father's considerable shadow. By his late teens and early twenties, Nagamasa had participated in several significant military engagements, demonstrating the martial prowess that would characterize his career[^9].

## Rise to Power

Kuroda Nagamasa's ascent to prominence accelerated during his service under Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1580s and 1590s. He distinguished himself in the campaigns to pacify Kyushu (1586-1587), where Hideyoshi sought to bring the powerful daimyō of Japan's southernmost major island under his control[^10]. During these campaigns, Nagamasa fought alongside his father, and their combined military and strategic talents proved invaluable to Hideyoshi's success. Following the successful conclusion of the Kyushu campaign, the Kuroda family was awarded Nakatsu Domain in Buzen Province (in modern-day Ōita Prefecture), with a kokudaka (rice production measurement) of 120,000 koku[^11].

Nagamasa's battlefield reputation continued to grow during Hideyoshi's ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful invasions of Korea (1592-1593 and 1597-1598)[^12]. He commanded forces during both campaigns, experiencing the brutal realities of overseas military operations. The Korean campaigns were marked by fierce resistance from Korean forces and their Ming Chinese allies, naval defeats at the hands of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, guerrilla warfare, and logistical nightmares[^13]. While these invasions ultimately failed to achieve Hideyoshi's grandiose goals of conquering China, Nagamasa gained valuable experience in large-scale military operations and further solidified his reputation as a capable combat commander[^14].

Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death in 1598, Japan entered a period of intense political uncertainty. The regency council established to govern during Hideyoshi's young son Hideyori's minority quickly fractured into competing factions[^15]. Tokugawa Ieyasu, the most powerful of the regents, maneuvered to consolidate power, while Ishida Mitsunari led a coalition of daimyō loyal to the Toyotomi cause in opposition[^16]. Kuroda Nagamasa found himself at a critical decision point that would determine not only his fate but also the future course of Japanese history.

Crucially, Nagamasa chose to support Tokugawa Ieyasu's Eastern Army rather than remain loyal to the Toyotomi faction that his family had served for decades[^17]. This decision was influenced by several factors, including his father Yoshitaka's strategic assessment that Ieyasu was likely to emerge victorious, personal relationships Nagamasa had cultivated with other daimyō who sided with Ieyasu, and possibly tensions within the Toyotomi power structure[^18]. Nagamasa's choice would prove decisive not only for his own fortunes but for the outcome of the conflict itself.

At the Battle of Sekigahara on October 21, 1600, arguably the most important battle in Japanese history, Kuroda Nagamasa commanded approximately 5,400 troops and positioned himself on the right wing of the Eastern Army[^19]. His forces engaged in fierce combat throughout the day, but Nagamasa's most significant contribution came through his diplomatic efforts before and during the battle. He had been instrumental in convincing Kobayakawa Hideaki, whose 15,000 troops were positioned on the mountain overlooking the battlefield, to betray the Western Army and attack his former allies[^20]. When Kobayakawa finally made his fateful switch in the early afternoon, attacking Ishida Mitsunari's flank, the battle's outcome was sealed. The Eastern Army achieved a decisive victory, and Tokugawa Ieyasu's path to becoming shogun was cleared[^21].

## Major Achievements

Following the decisive Tokugawa victory at Sekigahara, Kuroda Nagamasa's loyal service was handsomely rewarded. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted him control of the Fukuoka Domain in Chikuzen Province (modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture), with a massive increase in his holdings to 520,000 koku, making him one of the most powerful daimyō in Kyushu and among the wealthiest lords in all of Japan[^22]. This represented more than a fourfold increase from his previous domain and placed him among the top tier of Tokugawa vassals. The Fukuoka Domain would remain in Kuroda family control for the entire Edo period, until the Meiji Restoration of 1868[^23].

One of Nagamasa's most enduring achievements was the construction of Fukuoka Castle (Fukuoka-jō), also known as Maizuru Castle, which began in 1601 and continued for seven years until 1608[^24]. The castle was built on Fukusaki Hill overlooking Hakata Bay, incorporating both military defensive features and administrative functions. Nagamasa employed advanced castle architecture of the period, including multiple concentric defensive rings, impressive stone walls, moats, and strategic positioning of gates and towers[^25]. The castle complex was extensive, covering approximately 50 acres with multiple baileys and numerous buildings, though notably it never had a full-scale castle keep (tenshu), possibly due to financial constraints or strategic considerations[^26].

The construction of Fukuoka Castle represented more than military architecture; it symbolized the establishment of a new political order in northern Kyushu under Kuroda control[^27]. Nagamasa relocated the domain's administrative center from the old castle at Najima to the new Fukuoka Castle, and the surrounding castle town that developed became a major commercial and cultural center[^28]. The city of Fukuoka takes its name from Kuroda family's ancestral homeland in Okayama Prefecture, deliberately chosen by Nagamasa to establish a connection between his new domain and his family's origins[^29].

As a domain administrator, Nagamasa implemented various policies to develop his territory economically and maintain order. He promoted agriculture by encouraging land reclamation and irrigation projects to increase rice production, which was the foundation of domain wealth and samurai stipends[^30]. He also fostered commercial development in Hakata, which had been an important trading port for centuries, helping to restore its prosperity after the disruptions of the Sengoku period and Korean campaigns[^31]. Under Nagamasa's rule, Hakata merchants were granted certain privileges and protections that facilitated both domestic and foreign trade[^32].

Nagamasa played an important role in the Siege of Osaka (1614-1615), the final major military conflict that eliminated the Toyotomi family as potential rivals to Tokugawa authority[^33]. During both the Winter Campaign (1614) and the Summer Campaign (1615), Nagamasa commanded Kuroda forces in support of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Hidetada. His troops participated in various engagements around Osaka Castle, and his continued loyalty during this critical conflict further cemented the Kuroda family's position as trusted Tokugawa vassals[^34]. The successful conclusion of the Osaka campaigns marked the final consolidation of Tokugawa power and the beginning of the long peace of the Edo period.

Throughout his tenure as daimyō of Fukuoka, Nagamasa demonstrated administrative competence in managing his vast domain. He established policies for tax collection, law enforcement, and samurai administration that created stability in his territory[^35]. He also patronized Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, supporting religious institutions that played important roles in both spiritual life and social organization[^36]. His governance style, while firm and sometimes harsh, successfully maintained order in his domain and ensured its prosperity during the transition from warfare to peace[^37].

Nagamasa's military expertise was also codified for future generations through his contributions to martial tradition. He established training regimens for his samurai retainers and promoted martial arts practices that would be maintained by the Kuroda family throughout the Edo period[^38]. The Kuroda family would become known for producing capable military leaders and preserving martial traditions even during the long peace that characterized most of the Tokugawa era[^39].

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most significant controversy surrounding Kuroda Nagamasa concerns his relationship with his father, Kuroda Yoshitaka (Kanbei), particularly an incident that occurred around 1600[^40]. According to various historical accounts, Nagamasa confined his father to house arrest and later placed him in retirement at Chūshin-in temple in Kyoto, effectively removing him from active participation in domain affairs despite Yoshitaka's renowned strategic brilliance[^41]. The exact reasons for this dramatic action remain debated among historians, with several theories proposed.

One traditional explanation suggests that Nagamasa resented his father's overwhelming influence and reputation, feeling he could never escape Yoshitaka's shadow[^42]. Some accounts describe Nagamasa as having a more straightforward, military-oriented personality that clashed with his father's intellectual and strategic approach to problems[^43]. According to this interpretation, Nagamasa viewed his father's continued advice and interference as undermining his authority as the domain lord, leading to the decision to remove Yoshitaka from Fukuoka[^44].

Another theory proposes that the confinement was actually a strategic move to protect Yoshitaka from political enemies or suspicions within the Tokugawa power structure[^45]. Yoshitaka had served the Toyotomi loyally for many years, and some Tokugawa vassals may have harbored suspicions about his true loyalties despite the family's support for Ieyasu at Sekigahara[^46]. By publicly distancing himself from his father and placing him in retirement, Nagamasa may have been protecting both his father and the domain from political persecution[^47]. However, this interpretation has been criticized by some scholars as overly generous to Nagamasa.

The incident reflects poorly on Nagamasa regardless of interpretation, as Confucian values that dominated samurai culture placed tremendous emphasis on filial piety and respect for one's parents[^48]. Confining one's own father, particularly one as accomplished and renowned as Kuroda Yoshitaka, would have been seen as a serious moral failing by contemporaries[^49]. Some historical sources suggest that other daimyō and Tokugawa officials viewed Nagamasa's treatment of his father with disapproval, though his military value and domain's importance prevented any official sanctions[^50].

Nagamasa's military career, while successful, was also marked by the brutal realities of Sengoku-era warfare. During various campaigns, his forces engaged in practices common to the period but disturbing by modern standards, including the taking of heads as battle trophies, the killing of civilians caught in conflict zones, and the harsh treatment of defeated enemies[^51]. While such practices were typical of the era and shared by virtually all commanders, they nonetheless represent a dark aspect of his military legacy[^52].

His governance style as daimyō has also drawn some historical criticism for being excessively strict and harsh toward both commoners and lower-ranking samurai[^53]. Tax collection was reportedly rigorous, and punishments for infractions could be severe, reflecting the authoritarian nature of daimyō rule in the early Edo period[^54]. While maintaining order and authority was essential for domain stability, some accounts suggest Nagamasa's approach lacked the mercy and flexibility that characterized more benevolent rulers[^55].

The switch in allegiance from the Toyotomi to the Tokugawa, while politically astute and ultimately successful, also raises questions about loyalty and honor. The Kuroda family had served Toyotomi Hideyoshi faithfully for decades and had received significant rewards and advancement through that service[^56]. Nagamasa's decision to abandon the Toyotomi cause in favor of Tokugawa Ieyasu, though rational from a strategic perspective, could be viewed as opportunistic betrayal of his former lord's family[^57]. While many other daimyō made similar calculations, and loyalty to victor rather than defeated causes was often pragmatic necessity, the ethical dimensions of such decisions remain complex[^58].

---

## Personal Life

Kuroda Nagamasa's personal life was shaped by the expectations and constraints of his position as a major daimyō during the transition from the Sengoku period to the Edo period. He was married to Hōshun-in, who came from a prominent samurai family and served as his principal wife[^59]. Through this marriage, Nagamasa fathered several children who would continue the Kuroda lineage and maintain the family's position within the Tokugawa power structure[^60].

His eldest son and heir, Kuroda Tadayuki, succeeded him as daimyō of Fukuoka Domain upon Nagamasa's death[^61]. Tadayuki had been groomed for leadership from an early age, receiving education in both military and administrative matters appropriate for a future domain lord. The succession proceeded smoothly, indicating that despite any personal issues Nagamasa may have had with his own father, he took care to establish clear lines of succession for his own heirs[^62]. Tadayuki would go on to serve as Fukuoka daimyō for over forty years, maintaining the domain's stability and prosperity[^63].

Nagamasa's personality, as depicted in contemporary accounts and later historical assessments, differed markedly from his father's character. While Kuroda Yoshitaka was renowned for his intellectual brilliance, strategic subtlety, and sometimes devious tactical thinking, Nagamasa was described as more straightforward, direct, and oriented toward martial valor rather than complex strategy[^64]. He reportedly preferred clear action to prolonged deliberation and valued military courage and loyalty highly[^65].

Various anecdotes suggest Nagamasa possessed considerable personal bravery and was willing to lead from the front in battle, earning respect from his retainers through demonstrated courage rather than purely through his position[^66]. This martial bearing and willingness to share dangers with his men created loyalty among his direct retainers and helped establish his authority independent of his famous father's reputation[^67].

However, his straightforward personality also had limitations. Some historical assessments suggest he lacked his father's diplomatic finesse and ability to navigate complex political situations through subtle maneuvering[^68]. Where Yoshitaka could achieve objectives through indirect means and psychological manipulation, Nagamasa tended toward more direct approaches that, while often effective in military contexts, sometimes created complications in political ones[^69].

Religious beliefs and practices played a role in Nagamasa's life, as was typical for samurai of his era. He supported Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines within his domain, both as expressions of personal piety and as political acts that reinforced social order[^70]. After his retirement in 1620, when he passed domain leadership to his son Tadayuki, Nagamasa took the Buddhist tonsure and adopted the religious name Sōen, following a common practice among retired daimyō[^71].

His relationship with his children appears to have been more conventional than his troubled relationship with his own father. He took active interest in their upbringing and education, ensuring they received training appropriate to their positions within samurai society[^72]. The successful continuation of the Kuroda lineage through multiple generations suggests he managed family affairs more smoothly than his personal relationship with Yoshitaka might indicate.

Nagamasa's residence and lifestyle reflected his status as one of Japan's wealthiest daimyō. The lord's residence within Fukuoka Castle complex was elaborately appointed, though specific details about his daily routine and personal habits remain limited in historical sources[^73]. As a major domain lord, he would have maintained a substantial household staff, personal guards, administrative officials, and various retainers appropriate to his rank[^74].

## Legacy

Kuroda Nagamasa's legacy is multifaceted, encompassing his military achievements, administrative accomplishments, and the complicated personal relationships that have made him a subject of ongoing historical interest. His most enduring physical legacy remains Fukuoka Castle and the city of Fukuoka itself, which developed from the castle town he established and remains today one of Japan's major urban centers[^75]. The castle ruins, though much diminished from their Edo-period glory, remain an important historical site and tourist attraction, serving as a tangible connection to Nagamasa's era[^76].

The Kuroda family maintained control of Fukuoka Domain throughout the entire Edo period (1603-1868), an unbroken succession spanning over 260 years that testifies to the stable foundation Nagamasa established[^77]. The domain remained one of the more prosperous and stable territories in Kyushu, and the Kuroda family line continued to produce notable figures in Japanese history through subsequent generations[^78]. This longevity and stability represent perhaps Nagamasa's greatest achievement from a dynastic perspective.

Within the broader context of Japanese history, Nagamasa is remembered as one of the key figures who helped establish the Tokugawa shogunate's dominance. His role at Sekigahara, particularly his efforts in securing Kobayakawa Hideaki's defection, was crucial to the Eastern Army's victory and thus to the political order that would govern Japan for over two and a half centuries[^79]. Without the decisive Tokugawa victory at Sekigahara, Japanese history might have taken a very different course, making Nagamasa's contributions significant beyond his personal or family interests[^80].

The complex relationship between Nagamasa and his father Yoshitaka has become one of the more famous father-son conflicts in Japanese history, providing material for numerous historical analyses, literary works, and dramatic representations[^81]. This troubled relationship raises enduring questions about filial piety, the transmission of authority between generations, and the psychological pressures faced by those who must succeed renowned parents[^82]. The incident has been examined from various perspectives by historians, psychologists, and cultural commentators, ensuring continued interest in Nagamasa's personal life beyond his political and military achievements[^83].

In military history, Nagamasa represents a successful example of the warrior class's transition from the chaotic warfare of the Sengoku period to the more structured peacetime role of Edo-period daimyō[^84]. He demonstrated the ability to adapt from being primarily a military commander engaged in constant warfare to becoming an effective peacetime administrator managing a large domain[^85]. This transition, which many samurai struggled with, was essential to the Tokugawa system's stability, and Nagamasa's successful navigation of it provided a model for other daimyō families[^86].

The Kuroda family's martial traditions, some of which trace back to Nagamasa's era, continued to influence Japanese martial arts and military thought into the modern period[^87]. Various sword techniques, strategic doctrines, and training methods associated with the Kuroda family have been preserved and studied by martial arts practitioners and military historians[^88]. While separating specific contributions of Nagamasa from those of his father or later descendants is difficult, the Kuroda martial legacy as a whole remains influential[^89].

In popular culture, Nagamasa has been portrayed in numerous historical novels, television dramas, films, and other media focusing on the Sengoku and early Edo periods[^90]. He frequently appears as a supporting character in works about Tokugawa Ieyasu, the Battle of Sekigahara, or his father Kuroda Yoshitaka[^91]. These portrayals vary considerably, sometimes depicting him as a capable warrior overshadowed by a brilliant father, other times as an ungrateful son who failed to appreciate his father's wisdom, and occasionally as a more complex figure struggling with the burdens of succession and authority[^92].

From an architectural and urban planning perspective, Nagamasa's work in establishing Fukuoka as a castle town created an urban framework that influenced the city's development for centuries[^93]. The layout of streets, division of commercial and residential districts, and positioning of temples and shrines that he implemented during the early 1600s shaped the city's growth patterns well into the modern era[^94]. Even today, traces of the original castle town plan can be discerned in Fukuoka's urban geography[^95].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Military historians generally regard Kuroda Nagamasa as a highly capable commander and warrior who demonstrated both personal courage and tactical competence throughout his career[^96]. His performance in numerous campaigns, from the Kyushu pacification through the Korean invasions to Sekigahara and the Osaka sieges, established a consistent record of military effectiveness[^97]. Unlike some daimyō who achieved high rank primarily through birth or political maneuvering, Nagamasa earned his position partly through demonstrated battlefield prowess[^98].

Scholars of the Tokugawa period credit Nagamasa with establishing one of Kyushu's most stable and prosperous domains during the early decades of Tokugawa rule[^99]. The administrative systems he implemented, economic development he encouraged, and social order he maintained created a foundation that allowed Fukuoka Domain to thrive throughout the Edo period[^100]. His success in transitioning from military commander to peacetime administrator represents an important achievement that some other samurai of his generation failed to accomplish[^101].

Some historians have offered more sympathetic interpretations of Nagamasa's troubled relationship with his father, suggesting the situation was more complex than simple ingratitude or resentment[^102]. These scholars point out the tremendous pressure Nagamasa faced in succeeding such a renowned father, the political complications of Yoshitaka's former Toyotomi associations in the new Tokugawa order, and the practical difficulties of having two strong-willed leaders within one domain[^103]. From this perspective, Nagamasa's actions, while perhaps harsh, may have been necessary to establish his own authority and protect both his father and the domain from political complications[^104].

Architectural and cultural historians praise Nagamasa's vision in creating Fukuoka Castle and its associated castle town, viewing these as significant contributions to Japanese urban development and military architecture[^105]. The scale and sophistication of the castle complex reflected both practical defensive considerations and aesthetic values, representing the height of early Edo-period castle construction[^106]. The successful establishment of Fukuoka as a major urban center in Kyushu represents a lasting positive legacy[^107].

Political historians emphasize Nagamasa's crucial role in supporting Tokugawa Ieyasu at the critical moment of Sekigahara, noting that his diplomatic efforts in securing Kobayakawa Hideaki's defection were as important as his battlefield contributions[^108]. His political judgment in recognizing Ieyasu's likely victory and aligning with the Eastern Army demonstrated strategic acumen that would benefit his family for generations[^109]. This decision established the Kuroda family as trusted Tokugawa vassals and secured their prominent position throughout the Edo period[^110].

Biographers have noted Nagamasa's personal loyalty to those he served and expected similar loyalty from his retainers, creating strong bonds within his vassal organization[^111]. His willingness to reward faithful service and punish disloyalty created a domain administration marked by clear expectations and reliable hierarchies[^112]. The stability of Kuroda family control over Fukuoka Domain for over 260 years suggests the effectiveness of the administrative and political foundations he established[^113].

### Negative Views

Critics of Kuroda Nagamasa focus most heavily on his treatment of his father Kuroda Yoshitaka, viewing the confinement incident as a serious moral failing that reflects poorly on his character[^114]. Traditional Confucian values that formed the ethical foundation of samurai culture placed filial piety among the highest virtues, and Nagamasa's actions toward his father represented a clear violation of these principles[^115]. Some historians argue that no political or strategic justification can excuse such treatment of one's parent, particularly one as accomplished and worthy of respect as Yoshitaka[^116].

Several scholars have characterized Nagamasa as intellectually inferior to his father, lacking Yoshitaka's strategic brilliance and subtle understanding of human nature[^117]. According to these assessments, while Nagamasa was a competent military commander and administrator, he never demonstrated the innovative thinking or strategic genius that made his father one of the Sengoku period's most renowned figures[^118]. His preference for straightforward military solutions over complex strategic maneuvering is viewed by these critics as a limitation rather than simply a different approach[^119].

The switch in allegiance from Toyotomi to Tokugawa, while politically successful, has been criticized by some historians as opportunistic betrayal[^120]. The Kuroda family had received substantial benefits from Toyotomi service, including domain grants and positions of trust, making the decision to abandon Hideyoshi's heir for Tokugawa Ieyasu ethically questionable[^121]. While many other daimyō made similar choices and pragmatic flexibility was often necessary for survival in the period, critics argue this doesn't make such betrayals honorable or praiseworthy[^122].

Some historians critical of Nagamasa's governance style characterize his rule as excessively harsh and authoritarian, lacking the benevolence and care for common people that distinguished the best daimyō administrators[^123]. Accounts of severe punishments, heavy taxation, and strict enforcement of social hierarchies suggest a ruler more concerned with control and order than with the welfare of his domain's population[^124]. While effective in maintaining stability, such an approach is viewed by these critics as morally deficient[^125].

Military historians critical of Nagamasa note that, despite his reputation as a warrior, he never demonstrated the independent strategic thinking or innovative tactics that characterized truly great commanders of his era[^126]. His military successes came primarily as part of larger armies under the overall command of figures like Toyotomi Hideyoshi or Tokugawa Ieyasu, raising questions about how much credit he deserves for victories achieved primarily through superior force and better strategic positioning by higher-level commanders[^127].

The Korean invasions in which Nagamasa participated have been subject to increasingly critical historical assessment, with scholars emphasizing the tremendous destruction, suffering, and loss of life these campaigns caused[^128]. Participants in these invasions, including Nagamasa, bear responsibility for an aggressive war of conquest that brought misery to millions of Korean civilians and soldiers[^129]. While individual commanders cannot be held solely responsible for decisions made by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, their participation in and execution of these campaigns represents a significant negative aspect of their legacies[^130].
