## Summary

Kawakami Hajime (河上肇, 1879-1946) was a Japanese economist, journalist, and university professor who became one of Japan's first and most influential Marxist theoreticians. Born into a lower-ranking samurai family in Yamaguchi Prefecture, he rose to prominence as a professor at Kyoto Imperial University, where his writings on poverty and social justice captivated a generation of Japanese intellectuals. His journey from moralistic humanitarian to orthodox Marxist revolutionary, culminating in his imprisonment for Communist Party membership, made him a pivotal figure in early twentieth-century Japanese leftist politics. His autobiography, *Jijoden*, is considered a classic of modern Japanese literature.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Hajime Kawakami was born on October 20, 1879, in Nishikimi (near Iwakuni), Yamaguchi Prefecture, to Sunao Kawakami and Tazu Matasaburō.[^4] His family circumstances were complicated from birth. His father Sunao, aged thirty, and mother Tazu, aged sixteen and distant relatives, divorced after only nine months of marriage. Sunao remarried before Hajime's birth and took custody of the infant from Tazu.[^5] Young Hajime was raised by his stepmother, grandmother, and a wet nurse in a household marked by emotional complexity. When Hajime was two years old, his birth mother Tazu returned to the household, but she primarily devoted her attention to raising Nobusuke, Hajime's half-brother, while Hajime was raised by his paternal grandmother Iwa.[^6]

The Kawakami family belonged to the lower ranks of the samurai class and had fought against the Tokugawa Shogunate during the turbulent years of the 1860s. Sunao became a retainer for the Kikkawa clan, which ruled the Iwakuni domain in southeastern Yamaguchi Prefecture.[^7] The family had experienced considerable hardship; Sunao was raised in poverty after his father Sai'ichirō died when Sunao was only five years old, leaving him ineligible for his father's stipend until he reached age twenty.[^8] This legacy of samurai status combined with financial precarity would profoundly shape Kawakami's later preoccupation with poverty and social justice.

Kawakami's childhood was also marked by health concerns. Epilepsy was present in other members of the Kawakami family, and Hajime later believed that tantrums he experienced as a child were actually epileptic attacks rather than mere behavioral issues.[^9] He attended the Iwakuni School from age eight to thirteen, graduating in 1893, before leaving home to study at Yamaguchi Middle and High School in Yamaguchi city.[^10] His educational ambitions eventually led him to leave his native prefecture entirely.

In 1898, the eighteen-year-old Kawakami entered Tokyo Imperial University, one of Japan's most elite educational institutions, enrolling in the faculty of law to study political science.[^11] This marked a significant achievement for the son of a lower-ranking samurai family and opened doors to Japan's intellectual and academic elite. Already as a university student, Kawakami showed interest in social questions. In 1902, the year he graduated from university, he wrote an earnest letter to the famous socialist (and later Communist) Sen Katayama (1859-1933) expressing an interest in socialism and doubts regarding the "present social organization."[^12] However, his path to Marxism would prove neither straight nor simple.

---

## Rise to Prominence

After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University in 1902, Kawakami was hired to teach agricultural economics in the faculty of agriculture at Tokyo Imperial University, where economics was still a relatively new subject that afforded the ambitious young scholar considerable intellectual freedom.[^13] However, his academic career was briefly interrupted, and he spent a couple of years supporting himself as a journalist, an experience that honed his exceptional writing skills and public communication abilities.[^14]

Kawakami's major break came in 1908 when he was appointed to a position at Kyoto Imperial University, one of Japan's two most prestigious universities.[^15] He became a full professor of economics, lecturing to students at what would become his intellectual home for two decades. During his tenure at Kyoto, he established himself not only as a rigorous academic economist but also as a public intellectual with unusual gifts for making complex economic concepts accessible to general audiences.[^16]

While working as a journalist after his graduation, Kawakami had translated from English E.R.A. Seligman's *Economic Interpretation of History*, which became the first analysis of dialectical materialism to appear in Japanese.[^17] This early engagement with Marxist concepts would later prove transformative, though at this stage Kawakami's thinking remained primarily humanitarian and moralistic rather than revolutionary.

The event that catapulted Kawakami to national fame came in 1917, when he began a series of articles in the *Osaka Asahi* newspaper exploring the question of poverty. The articles created a sensation throughout Japan, due in part to Kawakami's accomplished writing style and his passionate moral engagement with social issues.[^18] These articles were later published as a book entitled *Bimbō Monogatari* (Tale of Poverty), which became a bestseller, reprinted thirty times by 1919.[^19] Ōuchi Hyōei later stated that Kawakami's work "told his generation of the existence of poverty in Japan," awakening social consciousness among educated Japanese who had been largely oblivious to the suffering of the lower classes.[^20]

In *Tale of Poverty*, Kawakami's perspective remained fundamentally moralistic, suggesting that poverty stemmed from "economic individualism" and that it could be overcome through the wealthy abstaining from the consumption of luxury goods, combined with more interventionist government policies including nationalization of industry and wealth redistribution.[^21] This approach reflected his engagement with Christian social thought and the influence of Leo Tolstoy, whose book *My Religion* had made Kawakami feel "as though I had been struck by electricity."[^22] He had become involved with Itō Shōshin's Garden of Selflessness (*Muga En*), a utopian movement that combined Buddhism, Christianity, and Tolstoy's humanism.[^23]

However, Kawakami's moralistic approach soon came under sharp criticism from younger intellectuals who were studying Marx more systematically. His own former pupil, economist Tamizō Kushida (1885-1934), launched a sustained critique arguing that the source of poverty should be located in the exploitation of workers by capitalists rather than in the consumption patterns of the wealthy, and that raising workers' class consciousness was more important than appealing to the morality of the ruling class.[^24] Kushida continued to criticize his former teacher, particularly for attempting to combine historical materialism and Marxism with a continued emphasis on individual morality and the importance of human will and consciousness.[^25]

---

## Major Achievements

Under pressure from Kushida's criticism, and profoundly influenced by the social impact of the 1918 "rice riots" in Japan and the Russian Revolution, the forty-year-old Kawakami began to reconsider his position and study Marx more earnestly.[^26] The rice riots of 1918 represented the largest, most widespread, and most violent popular uprising in modern Japanese history, lasting over eight weeks and involving some two million people in hundreds of municipalities.[^27] These events gave concrete reality to the abstract theories of class struggle and demonstrated that moral appeals alone could not address fundamental economic contradictions.

Beginning in 1919, Kawakami embarked on an intensive study of Marxist theory, transforming himself from a humanitarian moralist into an orthodox Marxist economist.[^28] He began publishing his own magazine, *Shakai Mondai Kenkyū* (Studies on Social Problems), which he used as a vehicle to educate students and workers in Marxist economics.[^29] During the 1920s, Kawakami produced an astounding volume of articles, pamphlets, and books on Marxist political economy, including a multi-volume work introducing the ideas in Marx's *Capital* and an enormous tome outlining the history of economic thought.[^30]

His introduction to the Japanese edition of Karl Marx's *Das Kapital* proved crucial in the development of theoretical economics in Japan during the 1920s and 1930s.[^31] Kawakami became not merely a popularizer but a serious theoretician, grappling with the intricacies of Marxist value theory, accumulation, and crisis theory. His work helped establish the theoretical foundations for Japanese Marxism as an intellectual movement, providing rigorous economic analysis rather than mere political sloganeering.

Kawakami's influence extended far beyond academic circles. His writings reached workers, students, and intellectuals throughout Japan, contributing to the growth of labor unions, tenant farmer associations, and other social movements characteristic of the Taishō Democracy period.[^32] His accessible writing style made complex Marxist concepts comprehensible to readers without formal training in economics, democratizing access to revolutionary theory.

In 1928, Kawakami's commitment to leftist politics intensified when his colleague Ikuo Oyama ran as a Labour-Farmer Party candidate in the Japanese general election. Kawakami actively campaigned for Oyama, writing articles and journals in support of the party.[^33] The Labour-Farmer Party represented an attempt to create a legal leftist political organization in Japan, though it faced intense government suspicion. When the party was banned by the Home Ministry on April 11, 1928, after accusations of links to the communists, Kawakami faced serious consequences.[^34] His political activities forced his resignation from Kyoto Imperial University in 1928, ending his twenty-year academic career at the institution.[^35]

After leaving academia, Kawakami made the momentous decision to join the outlawed Japanese Communist Party in 1932.[^36] He served as editor of *Shimbun Akahata* (Red Flag Newspaper), the party's underground publication.[^37] During this period, The Communist International had Kawakami translate important theoretical documents, which were published in *Shimbun Akahata* using the pseudonym Honda Kōzō.[^38] For four months he used multiple party hiding places while serving as editor, continuing his work for the Communist press despite the constant threat of arrest.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Kawakami's theoretical work faced substantial criticism from fellow Marxists throughout his career. In the mid-1920s, theoretician Kazuo Fukumoto, who had been influenced by Georg Lukács and Karl Korsch, criticized Kawakami's failure to understand dialectical materialism properly or to grasp the correct relation between theory and praxis.[^40] These debates were not merely academic; they reflected fundamental disagreements about revolutionary strategy and the nature of Marxist philosophy.

Scholar Yoshihiko Uchida later analyzed the criticism of Kawakami as reflecting "the difference in temperament between Kawakami, who tried to think in terms of the traditional spiritual climate of Japan, and critics like Kushida who tried to judge Japan using 'advanced' Marxism obtained from studying in the West."[^41] Uchida challenged "the conventional view that Kawakami simply turned from humanitarian socialism to militant Marxism," arguing instead that Kawakami's thought showed greater continuity and complexity than such simple narratives suggested.[^42]

The most controversial period of Kawakami's life began with his decision to go underground. He was notified of his imminent arrest on August 8, 1932, and went into hiding, living in the houses of friends and acquaintances while continuing his underground political work.[^43] After hiding for 122 days, Kawakami was arrested without incident at the beginning of 1933.[^44] In August 1933, he was convicted of violating the Peace Preservation Law and sentenced to five years in prison.[^45]

The Peace Preservation Law, enacted on April 22, 1925, had been designed to allow the Special Higher Police to more effectively suppress alleged socialists and communists.[^46] The law explicitly criminalized forming associations aimed at altering the *kokutai* (national essence) of Japan and criticism of the system of private property.[^47] More than 70,000 people were arrested under the provisions of the law until its repeal by Allied occupation authorities at the end of World War II.[^48] Many imprisoned communists recanted their beliefs under pressure—including prominent figures like Manabu Sano—but Kawakami refused to recant, maintaining his ideological integrity despite the consequences.[^49]

During his time in prison, Kawakami suffered from malnutrition and chronic stomach ailments that would affect his health for the remainder of his life.[^50] His imprisonment lasted until June 15, 1937, when he was finally released.[^51] Critics of Kawakami, both then and later, have questioned whether his decision to join an underground revolutionary party, given his age and prominence, represented political wisdom or romantic revolutionary idealism. His imprisonment removed one of Japan's most influential public intellectuals from the political scene during a critical period when militarism was consolidating its grip on Japanese society.

## Personal Life

Kawakami's personal life was marked by the complexities of his unconventional family background and his intense intellectual commitments. His wife's family, the Otsuka, like the Kawakami, were lower-ranking officials in the service of the Kikkawa clan who had fought during the Meiji Restoration, suggesting that his marriage reinforced connections to his samurai heritage.[^52]

Throughout his life, Kawakami grappled with questions of personal ethics and social responsibility. Before turning fully to Marxism, he had been involved with Itō Shōshin's utopian movement, *Muga-ai* (Selfless Love), which reflected his search for ethical frameworks that could guide social transformation.[^53] Religion did not play a major role in Kawakami's youth, and his family's Buddhist activities were mostly perfunctory.[^54] However, Leo Tolstoy's *My Religion* had a profound impact on him, and he combined Buddhist, Christian, and humanistic influences in his early thinking.[^55]

Interestingly, Kawakami's engagement with religion deepened during his imprisonment. While in prison and resisting ideological conversion (*tenkō*), he took up the question of religious truth and its relationship to Marxist social science.[^56] He borrowed the Shinshū Buddhist image of the "two truths" to assert that Buddhist law and Marxist social science should reinforce each other "like the two wings of a bird."[^57] This represented a unique synthesis in which he drew upon modernized images of Shinran (the founder of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism) in exile and a transcendent Western Paradise to resist the demands of a state that was bearing down on its citizens with increasing force.[^58]

After being released from prison, Kawakami spent the remainder of his life writing essays, novels, poetry, and his autobiography.[^59] He familiarized himself with Chinese poetry during his later years, finding solace in literary expression.[^60] Four volumes of his poetry were published posthumously in 1946.[^61] His final work, "On the Death Bed," a poem written as he approached death, was published in *Shimbun Akahata* shortly before he died.[^62]

Most significantly, Kawakami wrote his autobiography, *Jijoden*, secretly between 1943 and 1945, during the height of World War II and the most repressive period of Japanese militarist rule.[^63] The autobiography was serialized in 1946, shortly after Japan's defeat and during the Allied occupation, when political censorship had been lifted. It became a bestseller and was "extravagantly praised as being unprecedented in Japanese letters."[^64] The work is now considered a classic of modern Japanese literature, valued both for its literary qualities and as a historical document of an intellectual's journey through modern Japan's turbulent transformation.[^65]

Kawakami died in Kyoto on January 30, 1946, just months after Japan's defeat in World War II and at the beginning of a new era in Japanese history.[^66] He did not live to see the dramatic political changes of the postwar period, including the brief legalization and flowering of the Japanese Communist Party under the American occupation.

## Legacy

Kawakami Hajime's legacy in modern Japanese history is multifaceted and continues to generate scholarly interest. As of 1990, there were Kawakami Hajime Commemorative Societies in Tokyo and Kyoto with around 100 members that met three times a year on the dates of Kawakami's birth, death, and release from prison, demonstrating the enduring interest in his life and thought.[^67]

The most comprehensive English-language study of Kawakami is Gail Lee Bernstein's *Japanese Marxist: A Portrait of Kawakami Hajime, 1879-1946*, published by Harvard University Press in 1976.[^68] Bernstein's work provides both an intellectual biography examining Kawakami's "winding path to Marxism—from patriotic nationalist to academic Marxist to revolutionary Communist" and a portrait of his complex personality, as well as "an elegantly shaped narrative of the context and content of Japanese left-wing politics in the 1920s."[^69]

After his release from prison in 1937, Kawakami undertook one of his most enduring scholarly contributions: translating Marx's *Das Kapital* from German to Japanese.[^70] This translation made Marx's foundational work accessible to Japanese readers in their own language, cementing Kawakami's role as a bridge between European Marxist thought and Japanese intellectual life. He had been working on this translation throughout the 1920s, and completing it became a major focus of his final years.[^71]

Kawakami's influence on the development of theoretical economics in Japan during the 1920s and 1930s cannot be overstated. His introduction to the Japanese edition of *Das Kapital* was crucial in establishing Marxist economics as a serious academic discipline rather than mere political ideology.[^72] He trained a generation of students at Kyoto Imperial University, many of whom went on to become significant intellectuals and activists in their own right.

His *Bimbō Monogatari* (Tale of Poverty) remains historically significant as "the catalyst or turning point of an entire period," awakening social consciousness about poverty in Japan during a time of rapid industrialization and growing inequality.[^73] The work's impact extended beyond its immediate readership; it helped shape the discourse around social welfare, economic justice, and the role of the state in addressing poverty that characterized Taishō Democracy.

Kawakami's life journey from elite academic to underground revolutionary represents a particular type of intellectual commitment that resonated deeply in twentieth-century radical politics. The heir of a samurai family, an acknowledged authority on economics, a professor at one of Japan's leading universities, an early popularizer of Marxism in Japan, and a Japanese Communist who maintained his principles despite imprisonment—Kawakami embodied the tensions and possibilities of intellectual engagement with revolutionary politics.[^74]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessment of Kawakami has emphasized his role as an intellectual bridge-builder and his personal integrity. Yoshihiko Uchida, a renowned scholar of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, "struggled throughout his life with Kawakami's thought," ultimately concluding that Kawakami "lived fundamentally not as a scientist armed with precise and advanced scientific tools who sought results in the domain of his specialty, but as an ordinary person who grappled and tried to solve problems by starting from the questions that ordinary people feel."[^75] Uchida argued that "we must learn from Kawakami's experience a delicate relationship between 'science' and 'inquiry,'" suggesting that Kawakami's approach—combining rigorous study with ethical commitment and popular accessibility—offers valuable lessons for intellectuals.[^76]

Supporters have praised Kawakami's exceptional ability to communicate complex economic concepts to general audiences, his courage in maintaining his convictions despite imprisonment, and his refusal to recant his beliefs when many other imprisoned communists did so. His *Jijoden* is celebrated not merely as autobiography but as a literary masterpiece that honestly grapples with the dilemmas of intellectual life in a time of political repression.[^77]

Kawakami is viewed as a special figure whose influence remained significant in Kyoto academic circles long after his death, known for his moralistic views and ethical commitments.[^78] His integration of Buddhist philosophy with Marxist social science, particularly his use of the Shinshū Buddhist concept of "two truths" to reconcile religious and materialist perspectives, represents an original contribution to Marxist thought that has interested scholars of religion and philosophy.[^79]

His role in the development of Japanese Marxism as an intellectual movement—providing theoretical rigor, accessible popularization, and personal example—makes him one of the most influential Japanese Marxist thinkers of his time.[^80] His students and readers carried his influence forward into the postwar period, when Marxism enjoyed greater freedom and influence in Japanese academic and political life.

### Negative Views

Critics of Kawakami have focused on several perceived weaknesses in his theoretical work and political judgment. Fellow Marxists, particularly Kushida Tamizō and Kazuo Fukumoto, argued that Kawakami never fully grasped dialectical materialism or correctly understood the relationship between theory and praxis.[^81] They criticized his persistent moralizing and emphasis on individual consciousness as reflecting pre-Marxist humanitarian socialism rather than scientific socialism.

The criticism can be understood as reflecting "the difference in temperament between Kawakami, who tried to think in terms of the traditional spiritual climate of Japan, and critics like Kushida who tried to judge Japan using 'advanced' Marxism obtained from studying in the West."[^82] Some viewed Kawakami as insufficiently rigorous, too influenced by Buddhist and Christian ethical frameworks to be a proper materialist, and too focused on making Marxism accessible rather than maintaining theoretical precision.

His decision to join the underground Communist Party at age fifty-three, when he was already a nationally prominent figure, has been questioned as politically unwise. Critics suggest that he could have exerted more influence by remaining a public intellectual and legal commentator rather than going underground, where his access to audiences was severely limited and his imprisonment removed him from public discourse entirely during a critical period.

Some scholars have also noted tensions and inconsistencies in Kawakami's thought, suggesting that his conversion to Marxism was never complete and that he retained elements of his earlier moralistic and religious thinking throughout his life. This is viewed either as intellectual richness and originality (by sympathetic commentators) or as theoretical confusion and eclecticism (by critics seeking orthodox Marxist analysis).

## Famous Quotes

While specific documented quotes from Kawakami Hajime proved difficult to locate in English-language sources, his writings convey several recurring themes:

> "Poverty stems from economic individualism" - From *Bimbō Monogatari*, expressing his early moralistic view that wealthy individuals' consumption of luxury goods contributed to social poverty.[^83]

> "Buddhist law and Marxist social science should reinforce each other, like the two wings of a bird" - Kawakami's synthesis during imprisonment, reconciling his Buddhist influences with Marxist materialism through the Shinshū concept of "two truths."[^84]

Kawakami's work told his generation "of the existence of poverty in Japan" (as noted by Ōuchi Hyōei), awakening social consciousness through accessible prose that made economic suffering visible to privileged classes.[^85]

Leo Tolstoy's *My Religion* made Kawakami feel "as though I had been struck by electricity," demonstrating the profound impact of ethical and spiritual writings on his intellectual development.[^86]
