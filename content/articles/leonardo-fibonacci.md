## Summary

Leonardo Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa) was an Italian mathematician who introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to Europe through his book 'Liber Abaci.' The Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, appears throughout nature in plant growth, branching patterns, and spiral formations. His work transformed European mathematics by replacing Roman numerals with the more efficient decimal system.
