## Summary

Aurangzeb (Muhi al-Din Muhammad), also known as Alamgir I, was the sixth Mughal emperor who ruled from 1658 until his death in 1707, making his reign of forty-nine years one of the longest in Indian history.[^1] Under his rule, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, spanning nearly the entire Indian subcontinent with a population of over 158 million people and contributing nearly 25% of the world's GDP.[^2] A brilliant military strategist and tireless administrator, Aurangzeb was also a devoutly orthodox Sunni Muslim whose religious policies—including the reimposition of the jizya tax and temple destructions—remain deeply controversial.[^3] His legacy continues to polarize historians, with some viewing him as an efficient ruler who expanded the empire to its zenith, while others criticize him for religious intolerance that alienated Hindu subjects and weakened the foundations of Mughal power.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Aurangzeb was born on November 3, 1618, in Dahod, Gujarat, in the Malwa region of India.[^5] He was the third son of Emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, the beloved wife for whom the Taj Mahal was built.[^6] The young prince belonged to the Timurid dynasty, which traced its lineage back to the great conqueror Timur, giving him a prestigious pedigree that combined Turco-Mongol and Persian heritage.[^7]

As a Mughal prince, Aurangzeb received an exceptional education befitting his royal status. His curriculum covered military strategy, combat, administration, Islamic studies, and Turkic and Persian literature.[^8] Unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, young Aurangzeb displayed an intense religious devotion from an early age. He memorized the entire Quran and learned to write in beautiful calligraphy, mastering both Arabic and Persian languages.[^9] He also developed an appreciation for poetry and could compose verses himself, though he would later reject such artistic pursuits as inconsistent with strict Islamic principles.[^10]

Aurangzeb's personality contrasted sharply with the typical Mughal temperament. He grew up as a serious-minded and devout youth, wedded to the Muslim orthodoxy of the day and notably free from the royal Mughal traits of sensuality and drunkenness that characterized many of his relatives.[^11] This austere nature would define his character throughout his life. He showed signs of military and administrative ability early, and these qualities, combined with an insatiable appetite for power, brought him into bitter rivalry with his eldest brother, the brilliant and volatile Dara Shikoh, who was their father's favorite.[^12]

His early career demonstrated his considerable talents. By age sixteen, Aurangzeb had begun his military training.[^13] He held important administrative and military posts under his father Shah Jahan, serving as viceroy of the Deccan in 1636–1637 and governor of Gujarat in 1645–1647.[^14] These positions allowed him to gain valuable experience in governance and military command, preparing him for the brutal succession struggle that would eventually bring him to the throne. During these formative years, Aurangzeb developed a reputation as an accomplished military commander and a capable administrator, though his cold efficiency and religious rigidity already set him apart from his more culturally tolerant forebears.[^15]

## Rise to Power

The path to Aurangzeb's ascension was paved with fratricidal violence and political cunning in one of the most brutal succession wars in Mughal history. The crisis began on September 6, 1657, when Emperor Shah Jahan fell seriously ill, triggering a desperate power struggle among his four sons: Dara Shikoh, Shuja, Aurangzeb, and Murad Bakhsh.[^16] The ailing and senile Shah Jahan wanted his eldest son, Dara, whom he kept with him in Delhi, to succeed him.[^17] However, Dara's brothers—Shuja, governor of Bengal; Aurangzeb, governor of the Deccan; and Murad, governor of Gujarat—had different plans and sought at various times to form alliances against their eldest brother.[^18]

In the struggle for power that unfolded from 1657 to 1659, Aurangzeb displayed tactical and strategic military brilliance, extraordinary powers of dissimulation, and ruthless determination.[^19] He formed an alliance with his younger brother Murad Bakhsh, promising to divide the empire between them—a promise he had no intention of keeping.[^20] The allied forces of Aurangzeb and Murad first met Dara Shikoh's army at the Battle of Dharmat in April 1658, where they achieved a decisive victory.[^21] This was followed by the crucial Battle of Samugarh near Agra on May 30, 1658, where Aurangzeb's forces decisively defeated Dara Shikoh and his ally, the Kingdom of Marwar.[^22]

Following his victory at Samugarh, Aurangzeb moved swiftly to consolidate his power. He confined his father, Shah Jahan, in his own palace at Agra, where the former emperor would remain imprisoned until his death in 1666.[^23] The ruthless prince then systematically eliminated all potential rivals. Shah Shuja was defeated at the Battle of Khajwa on January 5, 1659, and subsequently fled into exile where he died.[^24] Murad Bakhsh, who had been Aurangzeb's ally, was betrayed, arrested, and eventually executed in 1661.[^25] Dara Shikoh, captured while fleeing, was brought back to Delhi in chains, paraded through the streets as a traitor, and executed in August 1659 on charges of heresy.[^26]

In consolidating his power, Aurangzeb demonstrated the same combination of military skill and political ruthlessness that had won him the throne. He caused one brother's death in exile and had two other brothers, a son, and a nephew executed.[^27] By 1659, all opposition had been crushed, and Aurangzeb emerged as the undisputed sixth Mughal Emperor, taking the regnal title Alamgir, meaning "Conqueror of the World."[^28] This brutal succession would cast a long shadow over his reign and set the tone for his uncompromising approach to governance.

## Major Achievements

Aurangzeb's nearly fifty-year reign witnessed extraordinary military conquests and administrative accomplishments that brought the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent. Extremely gifted as both an administrator and a military commander, he enlarged the state structure and expanded the imperial army to unprecedented levels.[^29] At his death in 1707, Mughal rule extended over more territory than it had ever occupied or would ever occupy again, stretching from Kashmir in the north to Tanjore (now Thanjavur) and Trichinopoly (now Tiruchchirappalli) in the deep south.[^30]

His military campaigns were extensive and relentless. Aurangzeb's major military operations included the protracted war in the Deccan against the Maratha Empire, the conquest of the Bijapur and Golconda sultanates, campaigns against the Rajput kingdoms of Baglana, Mewar, and Marwar, and defensive operations on the northwest frontier against the Pashtun tribes.[^31] By 1689, following the conquest of Golconda and other Mughal victories in the south, the empire had expanded to approximately 4 million square kilometers with a population estimated to be over 158 million people.[^32] This made the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb one of the largest and most populous states in the world at that time.

The economic achievements during Aurangzeb's reign were remarkable. Under his rule, the Mughal Empire contributed nearly 25% to the world's GDP, surpassing Qing China and making it the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power—more productive than the entirety of Western Europe combined.[^33] This period signaled proto-industrialization in the Indian subcontinent, with thriving textile, shipbuilding, and agricultural sectors that attracted European traders and established India as a crucial node in global commerce.[^34]

As an administrator, Aurangzeb was meticulous and tireless. Contemporary accounts describe his legendary work ethic: he woke early for morning prayers and remained in prayer and recitations for an hour and a half, ate only once a day, and remained occupied with the affairs of the empire until after midnight, sleeping for only three hours each night.[^35] He personally reviewed petitions, monitored provincial governors, and maintained strict oversight of revenue collection and military operations.[^36] His administrative reforms strengthened the mansabdari system (the military-bureaucratic structure) and improved revenue collection mechanisms, though these also increased the tax burden on the population.[^37]

Interestingly, despite common perceptions, Aurangzeb's administration showed significant religious diversity in employment. Between 1679 and 1707, the number of Hindu officials in the Mughal administration rose by half to 31.6% due to increased recruitment of Marathas for the Deccan campaign.[^38] In the second half of his rule, Marathas actually outnumbered Rajputs in his administration, demonstrating a degree of pragmatism in governance that contradicts the image of pure religious fanaticism.[^39] This administrative competence, combined with military prowess, enabled Aurangzeb to maintain nominal Mughal power over most of the Indian subcontinent for nearly half a century.[^40]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Aurangzeb's reign remains deeply controversial, primarily due to his religious policies that departed sharply from the tradition of religious tolerance established by his great-grandfather Akbar. The most direct anti-Hindu measure of his reign was the reimposition of the jizya tax in 1679—a poll tax on non-Muslim subjects that Akbar had abolished over a century earlier.[^41] The jizya was collected with strict orders and rules from permanent non-Muslim inhabitants of the empire.[^42] Interpretations of this policy vary sharply: some historians believe the jizya had the secondary objective of pressuring Hindu citizens to convert to Islam, while others argue it was reinstated in response to economic crisis and the need to fund the maintenance of the expanding empire, rather than to discriminate against non-Muslims.[^43]

The destruction of Hindu temples represents perhaps the most emotionally charged controversy of Aurangzeb's reign. He ordered the destruction of many temples and Hindu idols, including the famous Vishwanath temple in Varanasi (Benares), the Keshavnath temple in Mathura, and various temples in other regions.[^44] Some studies claim that in Mewar alone, he destroyed around 240 temples.[^45] However, modern historical scholarship has complicated this narrative. Some historians argue that Aurangzeb destroyed only a few dozen temples—far fewer than popularly claimed—and that temples like Benares' Vishwanatha Temple and Mathura's Keshava Deva Temple were destroyed because they served as bases for political unrest within the Mughal empire, not purely for religious reasons.[^46] Additionally, records show that Aurangzeb also provided grants for the maintenance of certain temples, adding further complexity to the picture.[^47]

Beyond specific policies, Aurangzeb's religious approach fundamentally altered the character of Mughal rule. As an orthodox Sunni Muslim ruler, he endeavored to make Islam a dominant force in his reign, reversing the policies of his three predecessors who had promoted religious syncretism.[^48] He banned music at court, prohibited certain festivals, and enforced Islamic law more strictly than any previous Mughal emperor.[^49] This religious policy replaced traditional Mughal toleration with a puritanical Sunni Islam that offended India's Hindu majority and alienated key groups including Rajputs, Marathas, and Sikhs.[^50]

The political consequences of these policies were severe. His incessant wars—particularly the exhausting Deccan campaign that lasted over twenty-five years—continually drained imperial resources and destabilized the empire.[^51] The Maratha campaign alone consumed vast amounts of military power and financial resources without achieving lasting success.[^52] His new Islamic policies alienated Hindu sentiment and undermined crucial Rajput support that had been a pillar of Mughal strength.[^53] The financial pressure on the land strained the entire administrative framework, and the punishing taxation required to fund his military campaigns created widespread resentment.[^54] Many historians argue that while Aurangzeb expanded the empire territorially, his policies simultaneously sowed the seeds of its dissolution by alienating large segments of the population and overextending imperial resources.[^55]

## Personal Life

Aurangzeb's personal life reflected the same austere discipline and religious devotion that characterized his public persona. Unlike many Mughal emperors who maintained large harems with dozens of wives and concubines, Aurangzeb had only three wives, making him notably restrained by the standards of his dynasty.[^56] His chief consort was Dilras Banu Begum, who wielded considerable influence over him and ruled his harem, retaining her power over her husband until the end of her life and always remaining his favorite.[^57] Dilras died in 1657, possibly of puerperal fever, just a month after giving birth to their fifth child, Prince Muhammad Akbar.[^58] Her death deeply affected Aurangzeb, and his other marriages to two secondary wives—Nawab Bai and Aurangabadi Mahal (some sources also mention Udaipuri Mahal)—were reportedly meaningless in comparison, with these inferior wives remaining largely isolated from their husband despite producing four more children.[^59]

Aurangzeb fathered ten children in total.[^60] The imperial couple's children from his marriage to Dilras included Muhammad Azam Shah (whom Aurangzeb anointed as heir apparent), the gifted poet Princess Zeb-un-Nissa (Aurangzeb's favorite daughter), Princess Zinat-un-Nissa, and Sultan Muhammad Akbar, described as the emperor's best-loved son.[^61] However, Aurangzeb's relationships with his children were complex and often tragic. He imprisoned his father, killed all three of his brothers and some nephews, and even jailed, drugged, and ultimately caused the death of his eldest son, Muhammad Sultan, demonstrating that family bonds held little sway when they conflicted with political considerations or religious principles.[^62]

His personality was marked by contradictions. Contemporary sources describe him as a devoted Sunni Muslim who was extremely orthodox in nature, maintaining a rigorous daily routine of prayer and religious observance.[^63] He woke early for morning prayers and remained in prayer and recitations for an hour and a half, demonstrating a level of personal piety rare among monarchs.[^64] Yet this same piety coexisted with ruthless political calculation. Historians describe Aurangzeb as ruthless and cunning, a complex person capable of being remorselessly "inhuman" as well as an efficient absolute ruler.[^65] He possessed undeniable military and administrative abilities and showed qualities like judiciousness and industriousness in governance, but these virtues were coupled with a capacity for extreme cruelty when he deemed it necessary.[^66]

Despite his immense power and wealth, Aurangzeb lived with remarkable austerity, particularly in his later years. He earned money by copying the Quran and selling embroidered caps he had sewn himself, refusing to use state funds for personal expenses.[^67] This lifestyle of self-imposed simplicity stood in stark contrast to the opulent court culture of his Mughal predecessors, reflecting his belief that a ruler should embody the religious virtues he sought to impose on his empire. This combination of extreme piety, administrative brilliance, personal austerity, and political ruthlessness made Aurangzeb one of the most psychologically complex figures in Indian history.[^68]

## Legacy

Aurangzeb's legacy remains profoundly contested more than three centuries after his death, making him arguably the most controversial figure in Indian history. The very name of Aurangzeb seems to act in the popular imagination as a signifier of politico-religious bigotry and repression, regardless of historical accuracy.[^69] Following British colonial historians, Indian nationalists used the last of the great Mughals in ways that simultaneously distorted Mughal history, transforming him into a symbol that served various political agendas rather than reflecting historical complexity.[^70]

In contemporary India and Pakistan, Aurangzeb's image continues to be invoked in political debates, especially under the Hindu nationalist BJP party, though modern visions of Aurangzeb are more myth than reality.[^71] Politicians regularly reference him to score political points, with Hindu nationalists portraying him as the archetypal Islamic oppressor, while some Muslim groups defend him as a pious ruler unfairly maligned by his enemies.[^72] This political exploitation has made objective historical assessment difficult, as Aurangzeb has become a convenient villain or hero depending on the speaker's agenda.[^73]

From a purely historical perspective, Aurangzeb's legacy for the Mughal Empire was deeply ambiguous. On one hand, he brought the empire to its greatest territorial extent and maintained centralized control for nearly fifty years over a vast and diverse population.[^74] His administrative systems and military organization represented the pinnacle of Mughal state capacity.[^75] On the other hand, his relentless military campaigns—particularly the exhausting and ultimately unsuccessful Deccan wars—drained the imperial treasury and military resources.[^76] His religious policies alienated crucial Hindu allies, particularly the Rajputs who had been pillars of Mughal military strength, and provoked rebellions among Marathas, Sikhs, and other groups.[^77]

Modern scholarship has begun to reassess Aurangzeb's historical reputation, with historians like Audrey Truschke arguing that he should be evaluated not by modern standards but according to the traditions and values of his own time.[^78] This revisionist scholarship notes that Aurangzeb never oversaw a large-scale conversion program, did not destroy thousands of Hindu temples (a few dozen is a more likely number), and did not perpetrate anything resembling genocide against Hindus.[^79] Some historians point out that he employed more Hindus in his administration than his predecessors and provided grants for certain temples while destroying others, suggesting his actions were driven more by political and strategic considerations than pure religious fanaticism.[^80]

Nevertheless, the negative assessment remains dominant in popular consciousness. Aurangzeb is widely blamed for setting into motion conflicts that weakened the Mughal state and created religious divisions that would eventually contribute to the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947.[^81] Whether this assessment is fair or whether it represents the "communalization of history" remains a subject of intense scholarly debate.[^82] What is undeniable is that Aurangzeb's reign marked a turning point: after his death in 1707, the Mughal Empire rapidly declined, fragmenting into smaller states and eventually falling prey to British colonial expansion.[^83] Whether Aurangzeb's policies caused this decline or merely coincided with inevitable historical forces remains one of the central questions in the historiography of Mughal India.[^84]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some historians and scholars have offered more sympathetic or balanced assessments of Aurangzeb, challenging the overwhelmingly negative popular narrative. These revisionist historians argue that many criticisms of Aurangzeb are based on exaggerations, colonial-era propaganda, or modern political agendas rather than careful historical analysis.[^85] Audrey Truschke, a prominent scholar of Mughal history at Stanford University Press, evaluates Aurangzeb not by modern standards but according to the traditions and values of his own time, presenting him as a complex figure whose relationship to Islam was dynamic and strategic rather than simply fanatical.[^86]

Defenders of Aurangzeb's legacy point to several facts that complicate the negative narrative. First, the claim that he destroyed thousands of Hindu temples has been significantly exaggerated; careful historical research suggests he destroyed a few dozen temples at most, often for political rather than purely religious reasons.[^87] Second, records show that Aurangzeb actually provided financial grants for the maintenance and repair of certain Hindu temples, contradicting the image of indiscriminate religious persecution.[^88] Third, in the latter half of his reign, Aurangzeb employed significantly more Hindus—especially Marathas—in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, with Hindu officials comprising 31.6% of his administration by the end of his reign.[^89]

Some scholars argue that Aurangzeb's religious policies, including the reimposition of the jizya tax, were politically expedient measures to consolidate Muslim support and generate revenue for expensive military campaigns rather than expressions of pure religious bigotry.[^90] They note that in the context of 17th-century political culture, Aurangzeb's actions were not particularly exceptional—European Christian rulers of the same period were equally intolerant of religious minorities, if not more so.[^91] From this perspective, applying modern secular standards to a pre-modern Islamic ruler represents anachronistic judgment.[^92]

Muslim scholars and historians, particularly in Pakistan and among Muslim communities in India, often present Aurangzeb as a devout and principled ruler who enhanced the administrative structure of the empire and upheld Islamic values in governance.[^93] They argue that his piety, personal austerity, and dedication to Islamic law represent admirable qualities that have been unfairly tarnished by Hindu nationalist propaganda and colonial-era historiography.[^94] These defenders emphasize his accomplishments as an administrator and military commander, arguing that he brought stability and expanded prosperity to large parts of the subcontinent.[^95] They contend that modern attacks on Aurangzeb are rooted in dark political motives, as many groups have found him a convenient villain for reasons having more to do with contemporary agendas than with his actual historical record.[^96]

### Negative Views

The dominant scholarly and popular assessment of Aurangzeb remains highly critical, viewing him as a religious fanatic whose intolerant policies weakened the Mughal Empire and poisoned Hindu-Muslim relations in the subcontinent. The influential historian Jadunath Sarkar, in his seminal 1928 biography, argued that Aurangzeb intended to establish an Islamic state in India through "the conversion of the entire population to Islam and the extinction of every form of dissent."[^97] Sarkar proposed that the jizya poll-tax on non-Muslims was specifically aimed at forcibly converting Hindus to Islam through economic pressure.[^98]

Critics emphasize that Aurangzeb's religious policies represented a dramatic and destructive departure from the tradition of religious tolerance established by Akbar and maintained, with some variations, by Jahangir and Shah Jahan.[^99] The reimposition of the jizya tax, the destruction of prominent temples including the Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Keshavnath Temple in Mathura, the banning of Hindu festivals in some regions, and the prohibition of music and arts at court all point to a systematic attempt to impose orthodox Sunni Islamic norms on a predominantly non-Muslim population.[^100] Hindu historians often critique his reign for its perceived intolerance and argue that these policies directly alienated the Hindu majority and critical Hindu allies like the Rajputs.[^101]

Beyond religious policy, critics point to Aurangzeb's political mistakes and their devastating long-term consequences. His execution of his brothers in the succession war and his imprisonment of his father established a precedent of fratricidal violence that would plague later Mughal successions.[^102] His relentless military campaigns, particularly the twenty-five-year Deccan campaign, exhausted the imperial treasury and military without achieving lasting success.[^103] The Maratha resistance, which intensified during his reign under leaders like Shivaji and his successors, demonstrated the futility of trying to impose centralized control over the entire subcontinent through military force alone.[^104]

Most damningly, critics argue that Aurangzeb's policies set in motion the decline and eventual collapse of the Mughal Empire. By alienating Rajputs, Marathas, and Sikhs—all of whom had been integrated into earlier Mughal power structures—he undermined the broad-based coalition that had sustained Mughal rule.[^105] The financial strain of constant warfare and the administrative stress of governing an overextended empire weakened state capacity.[^106] Within decades of his death, the empire fragmented into competing regional powers, leaving India vulnerable to British colonial expansion.[^107] While some scholars dispute whether Aurangzeb's policies directly caused this decline, the temporal correlation is undeniable: the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent under Aurangzeb and began its rapid disintegration immediately after his death.[^108] For these reasons, many historians view Aurangzeb not as a great emperor but as a cautionary tale about the dangers of religious intolerance and imperial overreach.[^109]
