## Overview

Ibn Battuta (1304–1369) was the preeminent traveler of the medieval world, often called the "Marco Polo of Islam"—though he traveled **three times further** than Polo. Born in Tangier, Morocco, to a family of legal scholars (*qadis*), he left home at 21 to perform the *Hajj* (pilgrimage) to Mecca. He expected to be gone for 16 months; he returned **24 years** later. His journeys covered 75,000 miles (120,000 km), spanning North Africa, the Middle East, East Africa, Central Asia, India, Southeast Asia, and China. His travelogue, *The Rihla*, is the most comprehensive eyewitness account of the 14th-century world (Dar al-Islam), documenting everything from court politics and religious rituals to sex, slavery, and the Black Death.

## The Journey Begin (1325)

"I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller in whose companionship I might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries."

He traveled across North Africa to Egypt.
**Alexandria & Cairo:** He marveled at the lighthouse and the bustling universities.
**Mamluk Protection:** He traveled safely because the Mamluk Sultanate policed the roads. This was the "Pax Islamica"—a Muslim scholar could travel from Morocco to China and always find a mosque, a bed, and a job as a judge.

## Notable Stops & Adventures

### The Middle East & Persia
He completed his first Hajj in Mecca. Instead of going home, he swore a vow: **"Never to travel any road a second time."**
He visited Iraq and Persia (Ilkhanate), meeting the Mongol rulers who had converted to Islam.

### The Swahili Coast (East Africa)
He sailed down to Mogadishu, Mombasa, and Kilwa. He described Kilwa as "one of the most beautiful and well-constructed towns in the world," built of coral stone.

### The Golden Horde (Russia/Ukraine)
He visited the court of Ozbeg Khan on the Volga River. He was amazed by the respect shown to women in Turkish/Mongol society (unlike the Arab world).
He made a side trip to **Constantinople** (Byzantine Empire)—the only time he traveled outside the Islamic world. He met the Emperor and saw the Hagia Sophia (from the outside).

### India and the Mad Sultan
The highlight of his career. He traveled to Delhi to seek employment with Sultan **Muhammad bin Tughluq**.
The Sultan was incredibly wealthy and generous, but psychotically violent. He threw criminals to elephants with blades attached to their tusks.
Ibn Battuta served as a grand judge (*Qadi*) for 6 years, living in luxury but constant fear. When the Sultan grew suspicious of him, Ibn Battuta cleverly asked to lead a diplomatic mission to China to escape.

### The Disaster at Sea
On the way to China, his ships were wrecked in a storm at Calicut. He lost all his wealth, slaves, and the Sultan's gifts for the Chinese Emperor. Terrified to return to Delhi (he would be executed for failure), he fled to the Maldives.

### The Maldives
He stayed 9 months, marrying into the royal family. He tried to reform local customs (specifically, women went topliess, which horrified him). He ordered them to cover up; they ignored him.

### China (Yuan Dynasty)
He eventually reached Quanzhou (Zaiton) and traveled to Beijing.
**Cultural Shock:** Even though China was safe and rich, he hated it. "China was beautiful, but it afforded me no pleasure... I was so troubled that I could not leave the house."
It was not Muslim. He was offended by them eating pork and dogs. It was the first time he felt truly "foreign."

## The Return and the Plague

He returned to Damascus in 1348, just as the **Black Death** arrived.
He chronicled the apocalypse: 2,000 people dying a day in Damascus. People of all religions fasting and praying together for salvation.
He miraculously survived and returned to Tangier in 1349, only to find his mother had died of the plague.

## The Rihla (The Book)

The Sultan of Morocco, Abu Inan Faris, insisted he record his travels. He dictated them to a scribe, Ibn Juzayy.
**Title:** *A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Traveling*.
**Credibility:**
Historians debate some sections. Did he really go to Beijing? Did he really visit the Volga? Some descriptions seem lifted from other authors. However, the vast majority is verified by geography and contemporary records.

## Legacy

Ibn Battuta was a "global citizen" before the term existed. His life proved the unity of the Islamic world in the 13th century. While Marco Polo was an outsider looking in (merchant), Ibn Battuta was an insider (judge/scholar) critiquing the societies he visited.
