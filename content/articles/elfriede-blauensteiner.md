## Summary
Elfriede Blauensteiner was an Austrian serial killer known as the 'Black Widow of Vienna.' She murdered at least three elderly men between 1992 and 1995 to inherit their money, using the drug Euglucon to induce fatal diabetic comas. She may have killed as many as 15 people.

## Early Life
Born January 22, 1931, in Vienna, Austria. She was a gambling addict who frequented casinos. She placed personal ads in newspapers seeking elderly, wealthy men, presenting herself as a caring companion. She was married and widowed multiple times under suspicious circumstances. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Blauensteiner targeted elderly men through personal ads, forming romantic relationships with them. She gradually administered Euglucon (a diabetes medication) to her victims to induce diabetic comas. She ensured she was named as heir in their wills before killing them. At least three murders were confirmed. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Suspicions were raised when her last victim's family questioned the circumstances of his death. Investigation revealed a pattern of deceased partners and suspicious inheritances. She was arrested in 1996, convicted of three murders in 1997, and sentenced to life imprisonment. She died in prison on November 18, 2003. [^3]
