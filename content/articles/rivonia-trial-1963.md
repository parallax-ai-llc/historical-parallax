## Overview

The Rivonia Trial (1963-1964) was the pivotal legal event in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Ten leaders of the African National Congress (ANC), including Nelson Mandela, were charged with sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government. The trial became a global platform for the anti-apartheid movement. Instead of denying the charges, Mandela used the courtroom to indict the racist regime, delivering his famous "I Am Prepared to Die" speech. Eight defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment, turning them into martyrs and international symbols of resistance during their 27 years of incarceration.

## Background

### Apartheid

**System:**
Legalized racial segregation and white minority rule in South Africa (1948-1994). Black South Africans denied citizenship, vote, and basic rights.

**Resistance:**
ANC initially non-violent (defiance campaigns). After 1960 Sharpeville Massacre (police killed 69 protesters), ANC banned.

### Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK)

**"Spear of the Nation":**
Armed wing of ANC formed by Mandela (1961).

**Strategy:**
Sabotage against government infrastructure (power plants, offices). Avoid human casualties initially.

### The Raid

**July 11, 1963:**
Police raided Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia (Johannesburg suburb).
Found:
- Documents (Operation Mayibuye - plan for guerrilla war)
- Weapons components
- Key ANC leaders (Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Ahmed Kathrada)

**Mandela:**
Already in prison (serving 5 years for leaving country illegally). Added to charges as Accused No. 1.

---

## The Charges

**Sabotage Act of 1962:**
Defined sabotage broadly. Minimum sentence: 5 years. Maximum: Death.

**Indictment:**
- Recruiting persons for guerrilla warfare
- Conspiracy to aid foreign military units
- Soliciting money for revolution
- 193 counts of sabotage

## The Trial

### Palace of Justice, Pretoria

**Dates:** October 9, 1963 – June 12, 1964
**Judge:** Quartus de Wet (no jury system)
**Prosecutor:** Percy Yutar (aggressive, sought death penalty)

### Defense Strategy

**Political Trial:**
Defendants decided not to deny political actions (sabotage) but to challenge the legitimacy of the laws and the apartheid state.

**Mandela's Role:**
Lawyer himself. Took lead in strategy.

## "I Am Prepared to Die"

### April 20, 1964

Mandela gave a statement from the dock instead of testifying (avoiding cross-examination). Spoke for 3 hours.

**Key Arguments:**
- Admitted forming Umkhonto we Sizwe
- Justified resort to violence (government laid no other option)
- Denied being communist (ANC was nationalist)
- Vision of non-racial democracy

**Famous Conclusion:**
> "During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."

Silence in courtroom. Global headlines.
