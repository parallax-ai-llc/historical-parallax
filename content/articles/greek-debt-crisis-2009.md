## Overview

In late 2009, the newly elected Greek government admitted that the country's deficit wasn't 6% (as previously claimed) but 12.7% (later revised to 15%). Years of cooking the books (with help from Goldman Sachs) were exposed. Greece could not pay its debts. This triggered a sovereign debt crisis that spread to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, and Spain (**PIIGS**), threatening to break up the Eurozone. Greece underwent the largest sovereign default in history and endured brutal austerity measures in exchange for bailouts, leading to 27% unemployment and riots in Syntagma Square.

## Causes: Living Beyond Means?

**Cheap Loans:** When Greece joined the Euro (2001), markets treated its debt as safe as Germany's. Greece borrowed heavily to fund public sector wages, pensions, and the 2004 Olympics.
**Tax Evasion:** A national sport. "Swimming pools" were hidden from satellite view with camouflage tarps.
**Statistical Fraud:** The deficit figures were systematically underreported to Brussels.

## The Troika & Austerity

Greece needed money. The **Troika** (ECB, EU Commission, IMF) agreed to bail them out (€300 billion+ total), but with harsh strings attached (Memorandums).
**The Cuts:**
40% cut in pensions. Minimum wage slashed. Public hospitals ran out of syringes.
**The Impact:**
GDP shrank by 25% (Worse than the US Great Depression).
Youth unemployment hit 50%.
"Brain Drain": 500,000 educated Greeks left the country.

## The Political Circus

**2015 Referendum (Oxi):**
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (Syriza) held a referendum on the bailout terms. 61% voted "No" (Oxi).
**The U-Turn:**
Facing a total banking collapse and exit from the Euro (Grexit), Tsipras ignored the vote and accepted even harsher terms a week later.
