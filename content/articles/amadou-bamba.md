## Summary

Amadou Bamba was a Senegalese Sufi scholar who founded the Mouride brotherhood, one of the most influential Islamic movements in West Africa. He preached pacifism, hard work, and devotion to God while resisting French colonialism through non-violent means. He was exiled by the French to Gabon and Mauritania but his following only grew. Today the Mourides number millions and their annual Grand Magal pilgrimage to Touba is one of the largest in Africa.
