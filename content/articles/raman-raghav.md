## Summary
Raman Raghav, also known as Sindhi Dalwai, was an Indian serial killer who terrorized Mumbai (then Bombay) in the 1960s. He murdered at least 41 people, primarily homeless pavement dwellers, by bludgeoning them with a heavy iron pipe while they slept. He was caught in 1968 and died in prison.

## Early Life
Born around 1929, Raman Raghav was from a poor family. Little is known about his early life. He was reportedly mentally ill and lived on the streets of Mumbai. He was considered a vagrant and moved between different areas of the city. [^1]

## Criminal Career
During two sprees (1966 and 1968), Raghav attacked people sleeping on pavements in Mumbai's suburban areas, killing at least 41 with a heavy iron rod or pipe. His victims were mostly homeless or sleeping outdoors. The killings created mass panic across the city. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Police launched a massive manhunt. Raghav was arrested in 1968 and confessed. He was found to be a paranoid schizophrenic. He was convicted and sentenced to death, which was commuted to life imprisonment. He died in Yerwada Central Jail, Pune, around 1995. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
