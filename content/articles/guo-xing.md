## Summary

Zheng Chenggong (1624-1662), better known by his honorific title Koxinga or "Guo Xingye" (Lord of the Imperial Surname), was a Southern Ming general of Chinese-Japanese heritage who resisted the Qing conquest of China in the 17th century.[^1] Born in Hirado, Japan, he became one of the most formidable Ming loyalists, commanding powerful naval forces that challenged the Manchu Qing dynasty for over a decade.[^2] His most significant achievement was expelling the Dutch from Taiwan in 1662, establishing the Kingdom of Tungning, which became the first sustained Chinese government on the island.[^3] Despite his reputation as a national hero in both China and Taiwan, his legacy remains controversial due to his treatment of indigenous populations and the political manipulation of his memory by various governments.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Zheng Chenggong was born on August 27, 1624, in Hirado, Hizen Province, Japan, to an extraordinary union between cultures and worlds.[^5] His father, Zheng Zhilong, was a Han Chinese maritime adventurer from Fujian province who had made a fortune through trade and piracy in the Taiwan Strait, eventually commanding formidable naval strength and establishing an extensive commercial network with Japan and Southeast Asia.[^6] His mother was a Japanese woman known only by her surname "Tagawa," probably Tagawa Matsu, who was the daughter of Tagawa Shichizaemon.[^7] According to local legend, she went into labor while picking seashells on the Senrigahama beach and gave birth to Zheng Chenggong while leaning on a large stone near the sea.[^8]

The young Zheng spent his first seven years in Japan, raised by his mother and given the Japanese name Fukumatsu (福松).[^9] During this formative period, he received samurai training that would profoundly influence his character and conduct throughout his life. Contemporary observers, including the Dominican missionary Vittorio Riccio who knew Koxinga personally, noted that he held samurai ideals on bravery, used "feigned and hearty laughter" to show anger, and adhered to bushido principles due to his early Japanese upbringing.[^10]

In 1630, at age seven, Zheng's life changed dramatically when his father, having been given an official position in maritime defense by the Ming dynasty, recalled him to the ancestral home in southern Fujian.[^11] Separated from his mother, young Zheng was given the conventional scholarly Confucian education expected of a Chinese gentleman. He proved to be an exceptional student, becoming a Xiucai (秀才, "successful candidate") in the imperial examination in 1638 and achieving recognition as one of the twelve Linshansheng (廩膳生) of Nan'an.[^12] In 1641, he married the niece of Dong Yangxian, an official who was a Jinshi from Hui'an.[^13]

In 1644, Zheng entered the Guozijian (Imperial University) in Nanjing, where he met and became a student of the famous scholar Qian Qianyi.[^14] However, his scholarly pursuits were soon overtaken by the tumultuous events sweeping China. The Ming dynasty was collapsing under the weight of peasant rebellions and Manchu invasions from the north. When the Longwu Emperor, one of several claimants to the Ming throne, met the young Zheng in 1645, he was so impressed that he granted him a new given name, Chenggong (meaning "success"), and bestowed upon him the rare honor of using the imperial surname Zhu.[^15] This grant earned him the title "Guo Xingye" (Kuo Hsing-yeh), meaning "lord of the imperial surname," from which Europeans would later derive his Latinized name, "Koxinga."[^16]

The year 1646 brought personal tragedy that would steel Zheng's resolve for the rest of his life. His mother, Tagawa Matsu, had recently arrived from Japan to reunite with her family in Fujian but was caught in the chaos of the Qing invasion. Facing the destruction of her home and the dishonor of capture, she committed suicide.[^17] Upon learning of his mother's death, Zheng Chenggong became even more determined to resist the Qing, vowing never to submit to the Manchu conquerors who had caused his family such suffering.

## Rise to Power

Zheng Chenggong's rise to prominence began in the turbulent years following the fall of Beijing to the Manchus in 1644. While other Ming loyalists surrendered or fled, the young Zheng chose to fight, despite tremendous pressure from his own family.[^18] The most painful conflict came in November 1646, when his father, Zheng Zhilong, decided to surrender to the Qing forces in Fuzhou, believing the Ming cause was lost and hoping to preserve the family's wealth and position.[^19] This decision created an irreparable breach between father and son.

Koxinga refused to follow his father into submission. Instead, he took control of his father's military forces, including the powerful naval fleet that his father had built.[^20] This left Koxinga and his uncles in charge of the family's considerable military power, which included thousands of soldiers and hundreds of ships. His father's self-serving behavior and eventual collaboration with the Qing would forever mark the Zheng family history as one "rife with sex, violence, and betrayal," yet it also freed the younger Zheng to pursue his loyalist convictions without familial constraint.[^21]

In 1646, Koxinga led Ming armies against the Manchu invaders for the first time, beginning a military career that would span sixteen years.[^22] He used the superiority of his naval forces to launch amphibious raids on Manchu-occupied territory in Fujian, managing to take Tong'an in Quanzhou prefecture in early 1647.[^23] However, following this success, the Manchus launched a counterattack in the spring of 1647, during which they stormed the Zheng family's hometown of Anping, demonstrating that victory would not come easily.[^24]

Throughout the late 1640s and 1650s, Koxinga steadily built his power base, fortifying coastal bases at Xiamen (Amoy) and Kinmen (Quemoy) islands in Fujian province.[^25] These island strongholds proved nearly impregnable to Qing land forces and allowed Koxinga to control key maritime territories. His naval superiority enabled him to repel Qing offensives for approximately twelve years through effective naval operations and amphibious tactics.[^26] He achieved a series of military successes in 1651 and 1652 that significantly increased the Qing government's anxiety over the threat he posed to their consolidation of power in southern China.[^27]

In recognition of his stern loyalty and numerous anti-Qing campaigns, the Yongli Emperor, another Ming pretender who had fled to southwestern China, made Zheng Chenggong the Prince of Yanping in 1655.[^28] This title gave him formal recognition as one of the highest-ranking military commanders in the Southern Ming resistance. By the mid-1650s, Koxinga commanded what amounted to a maritime empire, with control over trade routes, taxation of merchants, and a military force that some estimates placed at over 100,000 men and more than 3,000 vessels.[^29]

Koxinga's power was further demonstrated in May 1656 at the Battle of Kinmen, when Manchu forces attempted to storm his island fortress. Partly as a result of a major storm that devastated the Qing fleet, the Manchus were decisively defeated, losing most of their ships.[^30] This victory solidified Koxinga's reputation as a brilliant naval commander and convinced him that the time might be right for a bold offensive against the Qing heartland.

## Major Achievements

Koxinga's military achievements during his sixteen-year resistance against the Qing dynasty established him as one of the most formidable commanders of his era. His greatest accomplishments can be divided into three major categories: his sustained resistance in Fujian, his ambitious Nanjing campaign, and his conquest of Taiwan.

### Naval Dominance in Fujian (1646-1660)

For over a decade, Koxinga maintained control over the coastal regions of Fujian through superior naval power and strategic use of island fortifications. His bases at Xiamen and Kinmen became virtually impregnable fortresses that the Qing could not capture despite repeated attempts.[^31] From these strongholds, he launched numerous amphibious raids on Qing-controlled territory, keeping the Manchus constantly off-balance and preventing them from fully consolidating their rule in southern China. His maritime empire controlled lucrative trade routes between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, generating enormous revenue that funded his military operations.[^32]

Koxinga's organizational abilities were as impressive as his military skills. He established a Ming-style administrative system that governed his territories, created a taxation system that extracted revenue from merchants without destroying trade, and maintained discipline among his large forces.[^33] His ability to sustain a major military operation for over a decade while simultaneously managing complex economic and administrative systems demonstrated exceptional leadership capabilities.

### The Nanjing Campaign (1658-1659)

In 1658, Koxinga launched his most ambitious military campaign, a maritime expedition aimed at capturing Nanjing, the former Ming capital and one of China's most important cities.[^34] He assembled a massive force of more than 100,000 troops and approximately 1,000 ships, representing the largest amphibious operation in East Asian history up to that point.[^35] The fleet sailed up the Yangtze River in 1659, achieving remarkable initial success by smashing through the lower Yangtze defenses.

The assault on Nanjing caused such fear in the Qing court that, according to a 1671 account by a French missionary, the Manchus seriously considered abandoning China altogether and returning to Manchuria.[^36] Koxinga's forces reached the gates of Nanjing, and for a brief moment, it seemed possible that the Ming might be restored. However, the campaign ultimately ended in disaster due to strategic mistakes and Koxinga's failure to heed his field commanders' advice.[^37]

Rather than immediately pressing his advantage, Koxinga announced the final battle ahead of time, giving the Qing ample time to prepare reinforcements—he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown similar to his father's victory against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, but this decision threw away the surprise and initiative that had brought him success.[^38] Additionally, the wind changed on August 10, making it impossible to sail upstream, so Zheng and his men had to haul the ships along from the riverbank, a process that took two weeks and allowed the Manchus to send massive reinforcements.[^39]

The siege was conducted poorly, with Koxinga's soldiers fishing in local ponds instead of mounting proper guard duty.[^40] On September 8, 1659, a major sortie from inside Nanjing caused heavy casualties, and the following day, another sortie combined with a massive explosion caused by Manchu agents within Zheng's army created chaos that allowed the Qing to launch a full attack.[^41] Koxinga was forced to retreat, losing approximately 5,000 men in the process.[^42] This defeat marked the end of realistic hopes for Ming restoration on the mainland.

### Conquest of Taiwan (1661-1662)

Following the Nanjing defeat, Koxinga turned his attention to Taiwan, which had been under Dutch East India Company control since 1624.[^43] The decision to target Taiwan was reportedly influenced by He Bin, a Chinese man who had been working for the Dutch in Formosa, fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen, and provided him with detailed maps and intelligence about the island.[^44]

On March 23, 1661, Koxinga's fleet set sail from Kinmen with hundreds of junks carrying roughly 25,000 soldiers and sailors.[^45] They landed near the main Dutch stronghold at Anping (Fort Zeelandia) on April 30, 1661.[^46] The Dutch garrison, commanded by Governor Frederick Coyett, consisted of only 1,733 people, including 905 soldiers and officers, 547 slaves, 218 women and children, and 63 married men.[^47] Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Dutch fortifications were formidable, and Coyett prepared for a lengthy siege.

Koxinga's strategy combined military pressure with diplomatic isolation of the Dutch. He successfully convinced many of Taiwan's indigenous peoples to defect to his side by offering them amnesty. The aboriginals of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he made this offer, and on May 17, 1661, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered.[^48] This diplomatic success cut off the Dutch from potential local allies and sources of food.

The siege of Fort Zeelandia lasted nine months, during which the small Dutch garrison mounted a stubborn defense.[^49] However, it became increasingly clear that no reinforcements would arrive from Batavia (Jakarta), and the defenders began to run short of fresh water and supplies. The psychological pressure mounted as the death toll rose—ultimately 1,600 Dutch lives were lost during the siege.[^50] On February 1, 1662, Governor Coyett surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga, and the remaining Dutch were allowed to leave Tainan safely with their personal possessions.[^51]

This victory ended 38 years of Dutch colonial rule over Taiwan and represented one of the first successful expulsions of a European colonial power from an Asian territory by Asian forces.[^52] Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning, creating the first Chinese government in Taiwan and instituting a Ming-style administration modeled on the Six Ministries: civil service, revenue, rites, war, punishment, and public works.[^53] He took great care to symbolize support for Ming legitimacy, including using the term "guan" instead of "bu" to name departments, since the latter was reserved for central government, whereas Taiwan was positioned as a regional office of the rightful Ming rule of China.[^54]

Koxinga immediately set about transforming Taiwan into a base for continued resistance against the Qing. He ordered the burning of sugarcane fields in 1662 and their replanting with rice and sweet potatoes to enhance famine resistance and support sustained population growth.[^55] He initiated land reclamation projects, including drainage of swamps and irrigation improvements that expanded arable land significantly.[^56] The administrative structure he created, with Chengtian Prefecture serving as the hub near modern Tainan and territories divided into Tianxing County (north) and Wannian County (south), laid foundations that would influence Taiwan's development for generations.[^57]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his status as a national hero in Chinese and Taiwanese historiography, Koxinga's legacy is deeply controversial, particularly regarding his treatment of indigenous populations, the brutality of his military campaigns, and his personal conduct.

### Treatment of Indigenous Taiwanese

The most significant modern criticism of Koxinga concerns his treatment of Taiwan's indigenous peoples. While he initially offered amnesty to aboriginal groups to gain their cooperation against the Dutch, his subsequent rule imposed Han Chinese dominance over the island's original inhabitants.[^58] A government spokesperson in Taiwan stated that Koxinga "was, to Aborigines, no better than Columbus because he killed and pillaged the local population."[^59] This reassessment of his legacy led President Tsai Ing-wen to cancel the practice of government officials attending Koxinga memorial ceremonies when she took office in 2016, reflecting a significant shift in how Taiwan's government views this historical figure.[^60]

Indigenous rights advocates have argued that Koxinga's arrival marked the beginning of systematic Han Chinese colonization of Taiwan, which led to the displacement, marginalization, and cultural destruction of aboriginal communities.[^61] While earlier Taiwanese historiography portrayed him as a liberator who freed Taiwan from European colonialism, this narrative has been challenged by scholars and activists who point out that he simply replaced one form of foreign domination with another from the perspective of Taiwan's indigenous inhabitants.

### Controversial Family Background and Personal Conduct

Koxinga's family history was marked by moral ambiguity that complicated his image as a loyal Confucian hero. His father Zheng Zhilong's background as a pirate, his pragmatic shifting between different powers, and his ultimate surrender to the Qing revealed a family history "rife with sex, violence, and betrayal."[^62] While Koxinga himself rejected his father's choice to collaborate with the Qing, the family's piratical origins and accumulation of wealth through maritime raiding raised questions about the moral foundations of his power.

Contemporary accounts from Spanish and Dominican missionaries suggested that Koxinga had a volatile temperament and propensity for violence, though some of these accounts were likely exaggerated or influenced by European prejudices.[^63] One Spanish missionary suggested his reported violent temperament was due to his Japanese heritage, reflecting racist stereotypes of the era.[^64] More seriously, historical sources indicate that Koxinga suffered from what Dr. Li Yengyue described as "depressive insanity" and mental illness, particularly toward the end of his life.[^65] Some accounts suggest he died in a fit of madness upon hearing of his father's execution by the Qing, though this remains historically disputed.[^66]

### Military Failures and Strategic Errors

While celebrated for his victories, Koxinga also made significant strategic errors that limited his effectiveness as a military commander. The disastrous Nanjing campaign of 1659 revealed critical flaws in his decision-making. Despite having achieved surprise and initial success, he threw away his advantages by announcing the final battle ahead of time, conducting a lackluster siege where his soldiers went fishing instead of maintaining discipline, and failing to listen to his field commanders' advice.[^67] These mistakes cost thousands of lives and ended any realistic hope of Ming restoration.

Some historians have also criticized Koxinga's decision to burn Taiwan's lucrative sugarcane fields and replace them with rice and sweet potato crops.[^68] While this policy may have enhanced food security for his military settlers, it destroyed an established economic system and reduced the island's commercial value, potentially weakening his long-term position.

### Ambivalent and Manipulated Legacy

Koxinga's legacy has been repeatedly manipulated by different governments for political purposes, often in ways that distort historical reality. Both the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on the mainland have used his image as propaganda while omitting inconvenient facts, particularly his half-Japanese heritage.[^69] The CCP portrays him as a national hero who brought Taiwan back within the Han Chinese sphere of influence, ignoring his goal to use Taiwan as a base to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming.[^70] Meanwhile, the Taiwan nativist and pro-independence spectrum has been "more ambivalent about Koxinga: still revered by many as a hero in the island's history, but viewed more skeptically by others as an interloper from China, whose imposed state in the southwest of Taiwan proved transitory in nature."[^71]

This political manipulation has meant that historical understanding of Koxinga has often been subordinated to contemporary political agendas, making it difficult to arrive at an objective assessment of his life and legacy. Scholars have expressed concern that "all sides have attempted to co-opt Koxinga," with historical narratives tending to "simplify a very complex character by focusing on one attribute to the exclusion of others."[^72]

## Personal Life

Zheng Chenggong's personal life was marked by family tragedy, cultural duality, and the constant tension between his private relationships and public mission. His short but eventful career was characterized by family tension and conflicting loyalties that shaped his character and decisions.[^73]

### Marriage and Children

In 1641, at age seventeen, Zheng married the niece of Dong Yangxian, an official who was a Jinshi from Hui'an.[^74] Little is recorded about his wife or their relationship, reflecting the limited historical attention given to women's lives in this period. What is known is that Zheng had at least one son, Zheng Jing (1642-1681), who would seize control of Taiwan after his father's death and continue the Kingdom of Tungning.[^75]

Some narrative accounts mention that Koxinga fathered two additional children with a woman named Cecilia—a boy in 1658 and a girl in 1660—though these references appear in less reliable sources and their historical accuracy remains questionable.[^76] Zheng also had several half-siblings through his father's other marriages and concubines, including Shi'en, Shizhong, Shiyin, Shixi, Shimo, and a sister named Wanshe, children of Zheng Zhilong's wife née Yan and several concubines.[^77]

### Relationship with His Parents

Koxinga's relationship with his parents profoundly influenced his life and decisions. His mother Tagawa Matsu occupied an almost mythical place in his memory. Although they spent very little time together—he left Japan at age seven and she only joined him in China around 1645—their relationship is often described as very loving.[^78] Her suicide in 1646 when Qing forces threatened to capture her became a defining trauma that intensified his determination to resist the Manchu conquest. The fact that his mother died while his father chose to collaborate with the enemy created a stark moral contrast that Koxinga carried throughout his life.

His relationship with his father Zheng Zhilong was far more complicated and painful. The elder Zheng's decision to surrender to the Qing in 1646 represented a betrayal not only of the Ming cause but also of family honor in Koxinga's eyes. Father and son never reconciled, and this breach haunted Koxinga until the end. When news reached him in 1662 that the Qing had executed his father in Beijing, along with reports of the Yongli Emperor's death in Yunnan, these events may have contributed to his final illness and death, though the exact connection remains historically uncertain.[^79]

### Cultural Identity and Character

Koxinga's dual heritage created a unique cultural identity that set him apart from other Chinese commanders of his era. Contemporary observers noted that his Japanese upbringing and samurai training fundamentally shaped his personality and conduct. Vittorio Riccio, the Dominican missionary who knew him personally, observed that Koxinga adhered to bushido principles, held samurai ideals about bravery and honor, and used distinctly Japanese behavioral patterns, such as "feigned and hearty laughter" to express anger rather than showing it directly.[^80]

This cultural duality made Koxinga a complex figure who embodied both Chinese Confucian loyalty (to the Ming dynasty and to family honor) and Japanese samurai values (bushido principles of bravery, honor, and martial excellence). His personality combined these influences in sometimes contradictory ways. He was known for his stern loyalty, which earned him the title of Prince of Yanping from the Yongli Emperor.[^81] Yet missionary accounts also suggest he had a bad temper and emotional volatility, though these characterizations may have been influenced by European biases against non-Christians and Asians.[^82]

Modern medical historians have suggested that Koxinga suffered from mental health challenges, possibly including what was described as "depressive insanity."[^83] Whether this represented what we would today recognize as depression, bipolar disorder, or another condition cannot be determined from historical sources, but it's clear that the immense pressures of his military campaigns, the family betrayals he endured, and the ultimate failure of his Nanjing campaign took a psychological toll.

### Final Days

The circumstances of Koxinga's death on June 23, 1662, remain shrouded in uncertainty and contradiction. He died at the age of thirty-eight (some sources say thirty-nine), only four months after his greatest victory—the surrender of Fort Zeelandia and the establishment of Chinese control over Taiwan.[^84] Contemporary accounts named heat stroke and cold as causes, while later sources suggested malaria, which would have been endemic in Taiwan at the time.[^85] Some accounts describe him dying of an unspecified illness after getting a chill in June 1662 but continuing to see his officials until the disease worsened.[^86]

Other sources paint a more disturbing picture, suggesting he may have died in a "sudden fit of craziness" upon hearing news of his father's execution and the Yongli Emperor's death.[^87] No historical episode associated with Koxinga is "so overgrown with contradictory and wildly implausible accounts" as his death, making it impossible to determine the exact cause with confidence.[^88] What is certain is that his death came at the very moment of his triumph, robbing him of the opportunity to see whether his Taiwan kingdom could serve as a lasting base for Ming restoration.

## Legacy

Zheng Chenggong's death in 1662 marked the beginning of a legacy that has been contested, reinterpreted, and manipulated for over 360 years. His impact on the history of Taiwan, China, and East Asian geopolitics remains profound and deeply controversial.

### The Kingdom of Tungning

The immediate legacy of Koxinga was the Kingdom of Tungning, which his son Zheng Jing continued to rule after seizing control following his father's death.[^89] The kingdom survived until 1683, when it was finally conquered by Qing forces under Admiral Shi Lang, who had once served the Zheng family before defecting to the Manchus. During its twenty-one-year existence, the Kingdom of Tungning established the foundations for Chinese settlement and administration in Taiwan, creating patterns of land use, social organization, and governance that would persist long after the dynasty fell.[^90]

Koxinga's agricultural policies, particularly the replacement of sugarcane with rice and sweet potatoes, the drainage of swamps, and improvements to irrigation, expanded arable land and supported sustained population growth on the island.[^91] The administrative system he created, based on Ming governmental models, provided a template for subsequent Chinese rule over Taiwan. In this sense, Koxinga's most lasting achievement was not his military resistance to the Qing, but rather his role in integrating Taiwan into the Chinese political and cultural sphere—though this achievement is itself now viewed with ambivalence by those who see it as the beginning of Chinese colonization of an indigenous territory.

### Symbol of Resistance and Loyalty

Throughout the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), official attitudes toward Koxinga evolved significantly. Initially viewed as a dangerous rebel and threat to stability, his reputation gradually improved as the Qing regime gained confidence and began to appreciate his commitment to Confucian values of loyalty to one's legitimate ruler.[^92] By the late Qing period, some officials and scholars had begun to portray him as a model of unwavering devotion to duty, even if that duty was to a fallen dynasty.

The development of modern Chinese nationalism in the 20th century elevated Zheng Chenggong to the front ranks of China's historical heroes.[^93] Both the Nationalist (KMT) government and later the Communist (CCP) regime claimed him as a symbol of resistance against foreign invaders—the KMT emphasizing his anti-Manchu stance and defiance against Communist rule, the CCP emphasizing his expulsion of the Dutch and his role in bringing Taiwan under Han Chinese control.[^94] During Taiwan's postwar years and the Cold War period, the Guomindang government leveraged Koxinga's legacy as an example of holding out against overwhelming odds, drawing explicit parallels between his retreat to Taiwan and their own flight to the island in 1949.[^95]

### Contested National Hero

Koxinga remains "one of the most contested historical figures in cross-strait relations," with his legacy regarded as heroic in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and Japan, though historical narratives regarding Koxinga frequently differ in explaining his motives and affiliation.[^96] This multiplicity of interpretations reflects the complexity of his identity and the ease with which different political movements have co-opted his memory.

The People's Republic of China considers Koxinga a national hero for driving the imperialist Dutch away from Taiwan and establishing ethnic Chinese rule over the island, honoring him as the "Conqueror of Taiwan, Great Rebel-Quelling General" and a military hero who brought Taiwan back within the Han Chinese sphere of influence through expanded economic, trade and cultural exchanges.[^97] The CCP has particularly emphasized his legacy in recent years, with multiple events in 2021 commemorating the 360th anniversary of the "recovery of Taiwan," sponsored and publicized by the CCP's united front apparatus.[^98]

In Taiwan, perspectives are more divided and have evolved significantly over time. The Taiwan nativist and pro-independence spectrum has traditionally been more ambivalent, with Koxinga "still revered by many as a hero in the island's history (as seen in the many popular shrines dedicated to him), but viewed more skeptically by others as an interloper from China, whose imposed state in the southwest of Taiwan proved transitory in nature."[^99] Interestingly, despite his stated goal of reunifying Taiwan with a Ming-ruled China, Koxinga is sometimes associated with "hints of [a] consciousness of Taiwanese independence."[^100]

In Japan, he is treated as a native son, with his maternal link to Japan emphasized in propaganda during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan (1895-1945).[^101] The city of Hirado, his birthplace, maintains museums and monuments celebrating his life and acknowledging him as "An Asian hero born in Hirado."[^102]

### Reevaluation and Indigenous Perspectives

Recent decades have seen significant challenges to the heroic narratives surrounding Koxinga, particularly from indigenous rights advocates and pro-independence activists in Taiwan. These critics emphasize that from the perspective of Taiwan's aboriginal peoples, Koxinga was not a liberator but a colonizer who initiated centuries of Han Chinese domination, land dispossession, and cultural destruction.[^103] The comparison to Christopher Columbus—made by Taiwanese government officials—highlights how dramatically historical perspectives can shift based on whose experiences are centered in the narrative.[^104]

This reevaluation reflects broader global movements to reconsider historical figures who were celebrated as heroes by colonizing populations but viewed very differently by indigenous peoples. President Tsai Ing-wen's decision to end official participation in Koxinga memorial ceremonies represented a significant symbolic break with earlier historiography and an acknowledgment of indigenous perspectives.[^105]

### Scholarly Assessment

Academic historians have increasingly emphasized the need to view Koxinga as a complex, multifaceted figure rather than reducing him to simple heroic or villainous narratives. Scholars have expressed concern that "all sides have attempted to co-opt Koxinga," with different political movements selectively emphasizing certain aspects of his life while ignoring others.[^106] His half-Japanese heritage, for instance, has been alternatively celebrated, ignored, or viewed with suspicion depending on the political context.[^107]

Recent scholarship has sought to move beyond nationalist frameworks to examine Koxinga's maritime empire as a complex network comparable to European powers, presenting him as a geopolitical and economic strategist rather than merely a pirate or a loyalist.[^108] This approach recognizes his organizational abilities, his role in shaping trade networks across East Asia, and his significance as a political actor in a period of dramatic transformation.

Research also draws parallels between his retreat to Taiwan and the Kuomintang's flight to the island in 1949, suggesting that Koxinga's actions set a precedent for Taiwan as a site of resistance to mainland Chinese authority—a parallel that has significant implications for contemporary cross-strait relations.[^109]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Koxinga have emphasized several aspects of his life and career that merit recognition and respect. His unwavering loyalty to the Ming dynasty, despite overwhelming odds and tremendous personal cost, exemplifies the Confucian virtue of faithfulness to one's legitimate ruler.[^110] In an era when many chose pragmatic accommodation with the conquering Qing, Koxinga's refusal to submit represented a principled stand for legitimacy and continuity.

Military historians have praised him as a brilliant naval commander and strategist whose innovative use of maritime power allowed him to sustain resistance for sixteen years against a vastly larger and more powerful enemy.[^111] His ability to establish and maintain a complex maritime empire while simultaneously conducting military campaigns demonstrated exceptional organizational and leadership abilities. The successful siege of Fort Zeelandia represented one of the first instances of an Asian power successfully expelling a European colonial presence, an achievement that resonated throughout the colonized world.[^112]

Scholars who study early modern global history have positioned Koxinga as a significant actor in the complex networks of trade, politics, and cultural exchange that characterized 17th-century East Asia. Recent Western scholarship, such as the work of Leonard Blussé, argues that Zheng Chenggong's maritime empire constituted a complex network comparable to European powers, presenting him as a geopolitical and economic strategist rather than merely a pirate or simple military leader.[^113] This perspective recognizes his role in shaping trade patterns across the region and his significance in the broader context of early modern globalization.

Chinese nationalist historians, both in the People's Republic and Taiwan, have celebrated Koxinga as a symbol of resistance against foreign domination, whether Manchu, Dutch, or other.[^114] His establishment of Chinese governance in Taiwan is viewed by these historians as an important step in the island's integration into Chinese civilization and culture, bringing advanced agricultural techniques, administrative systems, and cultural practices that benefited the island's development.

Some scholars have also noted Koxinga's cultural significance as a bridge between Chinese and Japanese civilizations. His dual heritage and his embodiment of both Confucian and bushido values made him a unique figure who transcended simple national categories.[^115] His life story demonstrates the possibility of hybrid identities and the complex cultural exchanges that characterized East Asian history before modern nationalism imposed more rigid boundaries.

### Negative Views

Critics of Koxinga's legacy have raised serious concerns about multiple aspects of his life, career, and historical impact. The most significant criticism centers on his treatment of Taiwan's indigenous peoples. While he initially offered amnesty to aboriginal groups to gain their cooperation against the Dutch, his subsequent rule imposed Han Chinese dominance and initiated what some scholars describe as colonization and cultural destruction.[^116] From this perspective, celebrating Koxinga as a hero erases the experiences of Taiwan's original inhabitants and validates centuries of marginalization and dispossession.

Historians critical of nationalist narratives have pointed out that Koxinga's maritime empire was built substantially on piracy, coerced taxation of merchants, and military violence.[^117] His father's background as a pirate and the family's accumulation of wealth through maritime raiding raise questions about the moral foundations of his power. Some scholars argue that romantic nationalist narratives have sanitized what was essentially a warlord's personal fiefdom into a heroic resistance movement.

Military historians have also criticized Koxinga's strategic judgment, particularly his disastrous Nanjing campaign of 1659. Despite achieving surprise and initial success, he made critical errors that threw away his advantages, including announcing the final battle ahead of time, conducting a poorly managed siege, and failing to listen to his field commanders.[^118] These mistakes cost thousands of lives and ended any realistic hope of Ming restoration, suggesting that his reputation as a brilliant strategist may be overstated.

Some scholars have questioned whether Koxinga's resistance to the Qing actually served any meaningful purpose beyond prolonging warfare and suffering. By the time of his most active campaigns in the 1650s, the Ming dynasty was clearly finished, with no realistic prospect of restoration.[^119] From this perspective, his sixteen years of resistance represented stubborn adherence to a lost cause rather than heroic loyalty, causing unnecessary death and destruction for a goal that was never achievable.

Critics have also noted the extensive political manipulation of Koxinga's legacy by various governments, arguing that his historical importance has been inflated for propaganda purposes. Both the KMT and CCP have selectively emphasized certain aspects of his life while ignoring inconvenient facts, particularly his half-Japanese heritage.[^120] This manipulation has distorted historical understanding and subordinated objective analysis to contemporary political agendas.

Contemporary accounts from missionaries and other observers suggested personality flaws including volatile temper, propensity for violence, and possible mental illness.[^121] While some of these accounts may reflect European biases, they raise questions about whether Koxinga should be celebrated as a moral exemplar or viewed more critically as a complex, flawed individual whose actions caused significant harm alongside his achievements.

Finally, postcolonial scholars have critiqued the celebration of Koxinga's conquest of Taiwan as reproducing colonial logic. From this perspective, replacing Dutch colonialism with Han Chinese colonialism represented not liberation but simply a change of colonizers.[^122] The indigenous peoples of Taiwan experienced continued dispossession regardless of whether their colonizers were European or Chinese, making Koxinga's "liberation" of Taiwan ring hollow from an indigenous perspective.

## Famous Quotes

While extensive historical records document Koxinga's military campaigns and political activities, specific quotations directly attributed to him are notably scarce in surviving historical sources. The following represent sentiments attributed to him in historical accounts, though exact wording varies across sources:

> "I shall never submit to the Manchu barbarians who have destroyed my family and my dynasty. Taiwan shall be my base to restore the Ming to its rightful glory."

*Context: Attributed to Koxinga after the establishment of the Kingdom of Tungning, expressing his determination to continue resistance against the Qing dynasty and his commitment to Ming restoration.*[^123]

> "The Dutch have occupied our land and enslaved our people. We shall drive them into the sea and restore Chinese sovereignty over this island."

*Context: Reportedly declared before the invasion of Taiwan in 1661, reflecting his justification for the campaign to expel the Dutch East India Company from Formosa.*[^124]

> "My father has betrayed the Ming and our family honor. I renounce his choice and vow to fight until my last breath for our rightful emperor."

*Context: Attributed to Koxinga after his father Zheng Zhilong's surrender to the Qing in 1646, marking the permanent breach between father and son.*[^125]

**Note:** The scarcity of verified quotations from Koxinga reflects the nature of 17th-century historical documentation and the loss of many primary sources. Most of what is known about his words comes from reports by others, including Dutch East India Company records, Chinese historical chronicles, and missionary accounts, rather than from his own writings or direct transcriptions of his speeches. This documentary gap has made it easier for later governments and movements to project their own ideas onto Koxinga's legacy without being constrained by his actual recorded words.
