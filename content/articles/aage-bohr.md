## Summary

Aage Bohr was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater for discovering the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei. He was the son of Niels Bohr and continued the Bohr family legacy in physics. His collective model of the nucleus combined shell model and liquid drop approaches.
