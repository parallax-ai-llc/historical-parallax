## Summary

Ahmad ibn Hanbal was an Islamic jurist, hadith scholar, and theologian who founded the Hanbali school of jurisprudence. He compiled the Musnad, one of the largest collections of hadith. He famously resisted the Abbasid caliphs during the Mihna (inquisition) over the createdness of the Quran, enduring imprisonment and flogging. His theological and legal conservatism profoundly influenced later Salafi and Wahhabi movements.
