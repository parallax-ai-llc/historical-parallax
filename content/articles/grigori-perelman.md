## Summary

Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman is a Russian mathematician born on June 13, 1966, in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). He is renowned for solving the Poincaré conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems and one of mathematics' most challenging puzzles that had remained unsolved for over a century. Perelman made groundbreaking contributions to geometric analysis, Riemannian geometry, and geometric topology, developing revolutionary techniques in Ricci flow theory. In an unprecedented move, he declined both the prestigious Fields Medal in 2006 and the Clay Mathematics Institute's one million dollar Millennium Prize in 2010, citing disappointment with the ethical standards of the mathematical community. Since 2005, Perelman has lived as a recluse in Saint Petersburg, having withdrawn entirely from professional mathematics and public life.

## Early Life and Background

Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman was born on June 13, 1966, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), to Jewish parents Yakov and Lyubov.[^1] His family background was intellectually oriented: his father was an electrical engineer who enjoyed challenging young Grigori with brain teasers, while his mother Lyubov had abandoned her own graduate work in mathematics to dedicate herself to raising her son.[^2] The family was Jewish, and Perelman experienced anti-Semitism throughout his life in the Soviet Union, his overtly Jewish surname making him a target of discrimination during a time when Soviet distrust of Jews was strong.[^3]

Perelman's mathematical talent became apparent at the remarkably young age of 10.[^4] Recognizing her son's exceptional abilities, his mother enrolled him in Sergei Rukshin's after-school mathematics training program, a decision that would prove transformative for the young prodigy.[^5] In the summer of 1980, Rukshin tutored Perelman intensively in English so that he could qualify to enter Leningrad's prestigious Special Mathematics and Physics School Number 239 in September of that year.[^6] This specialized school was renowned for nurturing mathematical talent and provided Perelman with the rigorous environment necessary to develop his extraordinary abilities.

Perelman had a younger sister, Elena (born 1976), who also pursued mathematics, graduating from the University of Saint Petersburg in 1998.[^7] Elena later defended her doctoral thesis at the Weizmann Institute of Sciences in Rehovot, Israel, in 2003, and since 2007 has worked as a programmer in Stockholm, Sweden.[^8] The Perelman family's intellectual orientation clearly extended beyond Grigori alone, though his achievements would ultimately eclipse those of his relatives. His father Jacob emigrated to Israel in 1993, while his mother Lyubov remained in Saint Petersburg, where she continues to live with Grigori to this day.[^9]

## Rise to Prominence

Perelman's ascent in the mathematical world began with an extraordinary achievement at age sixteen. In 1982, not long after his sixteenth birthday, he competed as a member of the Soviet team at the International Mathematical Olympiad hosted in Budapest, where he won a gold medal by achieving a perfect score.[^10] This perfect performance at one of the world's most prestigious mathematics competitions for high school students immediately marked him as a mathematician of exceptional promise.[^11]

For his advanced studies in mathematics, Perelman entered Leningrad State University without needing to take entrance examinations, a privilege granted in recognition of his Olympiad triumph.[^12] He earned his Candidate of Sciences degree (the Soviet equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1990 with a dissertation titled "Saddle surfaces in Euclidean spaces."[^13] After completing his doctorate, Perelman began work at the Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where his advisors were the distinguished mathematicians Aleksandr Aleksandrov and Yuri Burago.[^14]

In 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Perelman was invited to spend a semester each at the Courant Institute at New York University, where he began groundbreaking work on manifolds with lower bounds on Ricci curvature.[^15] From there, he accepted a two-year Miller Research Fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993.[^16] During his time at Berkeley from 1993 to 1995, Perelman published several highly regarded papers on comparison geometry and Alexandrov spaces, establishing himself as a leading figure in geometric analysis.[^17]

In 1991, Perelman had won the Young Mathematician Prize of the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society for his work on Aleksandrov's spaces of curvature bounded from below.[^18] Then, in 1994, he achieved a breakthrough that would cement his reputation: he proved the soul conjecture in Riemannian geometry, which had been an open problem for the previous twenty years.[^19] This elegant proof, published in the Journal of Differential Geometry, demonstrated that if a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature contains a point where all sectional curvatures are positive, then the space must be diffeomorphic to Euclidean space.[^20] For his work on Alexandrov spaces and the soul conjecture, Perelman was invited to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich in 1994, where he delivered a lecture titled "Spaces with curvature bounded below."[^21]

After proving the soul conjecture, Perelman was offered positions at several top universities in the United States, including Princeton and Stanford.[^22] However, in a decision that foreshadowed his later withdrawal from the mathematical establishment, he rejected all these offers and returned to the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg in the summer of 1995 for a research-only position.[^23]

## Major Achievements

Perelman's crowning achievement—and one of the most significant mathematical accomplishments of the 21st century—was his proof of the Poincaré conjecture and the broader geometrization conjecture. On November 11, 2002, Perelman quietly uploaded a paper titled "The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications" to arXiv, a preprint repository hosted by Cornell University.[^24] This was followed by a second paper, "Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds," posted in March 2003, and a third paper posted in July 2003 outlining additional arguments sufficient for proving the Poincaré conjecture.[^25]

The Poincaré conjecture, formulated by French mathematician Henri Poincaré in 1904, proposed that every simply connected, closed three-dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere.[^26] This deceptively simple statement had resisted the efforts of mathematicians for over a century and was widely considered one of the most important unsolved problems in topology. In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute designated it as one of seven Millennium Prize Problems, offering a one million dollar reward for its solution.[^27]

Perelman's approach built upon decades of prior work, particularly Richard Hamilton's theory of Ricci flow, a process for deforming Riemannian metrics on manifolds that Hamilton had introduced in the 1980s.[^28] Hamilton had shown that if certain technical obstacles could be overcome—particularly the problem of singularities that form during the flow—then the Ricci flow could be used to prove William Thurston's geometrization conjecture, a sweeping proposal about the structure of three-dimensional manifolds that encompassed the Poincaré conjecture as a special case.[^29]

Perelman's breakthrough was to develop the tools necessary to overcome these obstacles. He introduced an entropy formula that provided the Ricci flow with a preferred direction, ruling out specific singularities that had stymied Hamilton.[^30] He showed how to bound how shapes can degenerate through a non-collapsing theorem, and demonstrated how to perform "surgery" on the manifold—cutting around problematic regions and continuing the flow.[^31] By developing these novel techniques and results, Perelman was able to modify and complete Hamilton's program, ultimately proving both the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture.[^32]

The verification of Perelman's proof was itself a remarkable mathematical effort. From May to July 2006, several groups of mathematicians presented papers that meticulously filled in the details of Perelman's work.[^33] All three verification teams—including those led by Bruce Kleiner and John Lott, Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu, and John Morgan and Gang Tian—concluded that the gaps in Perelman's papers were minor and could be filled in using his own techniques.[^34] The journal Science marked Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture as the scientific Breakthrough of the Year in 2006.[^35]

Beyond the Poincaré conjecture, Perelman made significant contributions to other areas of mathematics. In a well-known 1992 paper coauthored with Yuri Burago and Mikhail Gromov, he laid out modern foundations for the study of Alexandrov spaces, with the notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence as an organizing principle.[^36] His work on comparison geometry, particularly on manifolds with positive Ricci curvature and large Betti numbers, advanced understanding of how geometric and topological properties interrelate.[^37]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Perelman's relationship with the mathematical establishment became increasingly fraught in the years following his proof. In 2005, he resigned from his research post at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, and in 2006 stated that he had quit professional mathematics entirely, owing to his disappointment over what he perceived as lax ethical standards in the field.[^38]

A major source of his disillusionment was a controversy involving Fields Medalist Shing-Tung Yau. Following Perelman's posting of his proof, Yau contended that Perelman's papers were too brief and riddled with gaps.[^39] He enlisted two of his students, Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu, to work on what he characterized as an alternate proof, later claiming that the students—and by extension, he himself—deserved credit for completing what Richard Hamilton had begun.[^40] In 2006, Cao and Zhu published a 328-page paper titled in part "A Complete Proof of the Poincare," which many in the mathematical community viewed as an attempt to claim credit for Perelman's work.[^41]

A 2006 article in The New Yorker titled "Manifold Destiny" painted an unflattering portrait of Yau in connection with the controversy, describing how he had allegedly tried to diminish Perelman's achievement.[^42] Yau's attorneys released a letter accusing The New Yorker and the article's authors of defamation, claiming the reporters had fabricated quotes and deliberately distorted facts; however, the magazine stood by its story.[^43] Under a storm of negative publicity and criticism within the mathematics community, Yau appears to have retreated from his claims.[^44]

Perelman expressed his frustration with the mathematical community's response to such behavior, stating: "Of course, there are many mathematicians who are more or less honest. But almost all of them are conformists. They are more or less honest, but they tolerate those who are not honest."[^45] He characterized this tolerance of unethical behavior as central to his decision to withdraw from professional mathematics. "It is not people who break ethical standards who are regarded as aliens," he observed. "It is people like me who are isolated."[^46]

In August 2006, Perelman was awarded the Fields Medal "for his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow" at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid.[^47] Sir John Ball, president of the International Mathematical Union, traveled to Saint Petersburg in June 2006 to persuade Perelman to accept the prize, spending two days with the reclusive mathematician.[^48] However, Perelman declined to accept the medal, making him the first person ever to refuse the Fields Medal.[^49] When announcing the award, Ball told the press that Perelman's reasons for refusing were complex, but that "it centres around his feeling of isolation from the mathematical community, and not wanting to be seen as a figurehead."[^50]

Perelman stated bluntly: "I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo."[^51] He also remarked: "Everybody understood that if the proof is correct then no other recognition is needed."[^52]

On March 18, 2010, the Clay Mathematics Institute awarded Perelman the one million dollar Millennium Prize in recognition of his proof of the Poincaré conjecture.[^53] On July 1, 2010, Perelman rejected this prize as well, telling Interfax that he considered the decision of the Clay Institute's board to be unfair, explaining that "his contribution to solving the Poincaré conjecture was no greater than that of Richard S. Hamilton."[^54] James Carlson, the institute's president, said that Perelman's decision was not a complete surprise and that Perelman had told him by telephone of his decision, giving as his main reason: "my disagreement with the organized mathematical community."[^55]

## Personal Life

Grigori Perelman has lived as a recluse in Saint Petersburg since withdrawing from professional mathematics. He resides in a small apartment with his elderly mother Lyubov in the suburbs of the city, leading what has been described as a hermit's life of silence and frugality.[^56] Though he has his own apartment, he rarely visits it, preferring to stay with his mother.[^57] Russian media has speculated that he periodically visits his sister Elena in Sweden, though such trips remain unconfirmed.[^58]

Perelman has consistently avoided journalists and members of the media since 2006.[^59] When the journalist and author Masha Gessen attempted to interview him for her biography "Perfect Rigor: A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century," published in 2009, Perelman refused to meet with her.[^60] Gessen instead talked to virtually all the people who had been important in his life: his lifelong math tutor, his classmates, his high school math teacher, his competition coaches and teammates, his university thesis adviser, and his coauthors.[^61] When contacted by a reporter on one occasion, Perelman reportedly said: "You are disturbing me. I am picking mushrooms."[^62]

Those who know Perelman describe him as a man of rigid moral principles. Mathematician Mikhael Gromov commented: "[Perelman] has moral principles to which he holds. And this surprises people. They often say he acts strangely because he acts honestly, in a nonconformist manner, which is unpopular in this community—even though it should be the norm."[^63] Perelman himself has stated enigmatically: "I know how to control the Universe. Why would I run to get a million, tell me?"[^64]

He politely turns down all offers to take part in official events, television programs, scientific discussions, and invitations to give lectures.[^65] His withdrawal from public life has been so complete that he has become almost a mythical figure, with occasional rumors and speculation about his activities circulating in Russian media and mathematics circles, but little confirmed information emerging from his self-imposed isolation.

## Legacy

Perelman's legacy in mathematics is profound and multifaceted. His proof of the Poincaré conjecture represents one of the most significant mathematical achievements of the modern era, resolving a century-old problem while fundamentally advancing understanding of geometric analysis and topology.[^66] Hamilton and Perelman's work on the conjecture is widely recognized as a milestone of mathematical research.[^67]

Beyond the immediate result, Perelman's techniques have had far-reaching influence. His tools shaped new work on geometric flows, with researchers adapting similar ideas in higher dimensions, in Kähler geometry, and in analysis on metric spaces.[^68] Ricci flow now inspires algorithms that smooth meshes and denoise geometric data, finding applications beyond pure mathematics.[^69] The entropy formula and non-collapsing theorems that Perelman developed have become fundamental tools in geometric analysis.[^70]

The Clay Mathematics Institute used Perelman's declined prize money to fund the "Poincaré Chair," a temporary position for young promising mathematicians at the Paris Institut Henri Poincaré.[^71] In this way, even his rejection of the prize has contributed to the advancement of mathematics by supporting the next generation of researchers.

Perelman's withdrawal from mathematics and rejection of its highest honors have made him a symbol of intellectual purity and independence. His insistence on ethical standards and his refusal to participate in what he viewed as the corrupted culture of the mathematical establishment have sparked ongoing debates about credit, collaboration, and integrity in scientific research. Whether viewed as a principled stand against institutional corruption or as excessive idealism, his actions have challenged the mathematical community to examine its own values and practices.

His story has captured public imagination beyond the mathematics community, inspiring books, articles, and discussions about the nature of genius, the price of integrity, and the relationship between individuals and institutions. The image of a brilliant mathematician living in isolation, having solved one of humanity's greatest intellectual puzzles yet wanting nothing from society in return, resonates as a powerful modern parable about the pursuit of truth for its own sake.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

The mathematical community has universally recognized Perelman's intellectual achievement as extraordinary. John Lott, one of the mathematicians who verified Perelman's proof, described the work as containing "revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow."[^72] The verification teams that examined Perelman's papers concluded that his techniques were not only correct but represented fundamental advances in geometric analysis.[^73]

Many mathematicians have expressed admiration for Perelman's moral stance. His rejection of awards and insistence on proper attribution to Richard Hamilton has been praised as exemplifying scientific integrity. Gromov's observation that Perelman "acts honestly, in a nonconformist manner" captures the view of those who see his behavior as a necessary corrective to academic politics and credit disputes.[^74]

Perelman's contributions to Alexandrov geometry, comparison geometry, and his proof of the soul conjecture are recognized as major achievements independent of the Poincaré conjecture.[^75] His 1994 proof of the soul conjecture has been described as "short and striking," representing the kind of elegant mathematical reasoning that characterizes the highest level of the discipline.[^76]

The broader scientific community has acknowledged the significance of his work through honors he did not accept. The International Mathematical Union's decision to award him the Fields Medal and the Clay Institute's decision to award him the Millennium Prize both represent consensus judgments by the world's leading mathematicians that his achievement was historic.[^77]

### Negative Views

Some critics have questioned whether Perelman's withdrawal from mathematics represents a loss to the field. They argue that a mathematician of his caliber could have made additional major contributions had he continued working, and that his refusal to engage with the mathematical community has deprived younger mathematicians of the opportunity to learn from him directly.[^78]

Others have suggested that Perelman's characterization of the mathematical community's ethical standards may be overly harsh or based on a small number of incidents. While acknowledging that the dispute with Yau was regrettable, some mathematicians argue that the vast majority of researchers operate with integrity and that Perelman's blanket criticism is unfair.[^79]

There has been debate about whether Perelman's rejection of the Millennium Prize was appropriate, given that his stated reason—that Hamilton's contribution was equal to his own—might undervalue the crucial breakthroughs that only Perelman achieved. While Hamilton developed the Ricci flow framework, it was Perelman who solved the specific technical problems that made the proof possible.[^80]

Some have characterized Perelman's reclusiveness as potentially stemming from social difficulties rather than purely from principled objection to the mathematical community. This view, while speculative given Perelman's refusal to be interviewed, suggests that personal factors beyond ethical disagreements may have contributed to his withdrawal.[^81]
