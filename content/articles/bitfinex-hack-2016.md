## Overview

In 2016, the Bitfinex exchange was hacked, losing nearly 120,000 Bitcoin ($72 million then).
For years, the money sat dormant. As Bitcoin's price exploded, the stash became worth over **$4.5 billion**.
In 2022, the DOJ arrested a hipster couple in New York: **Ilya Lichtenstein** and his wife **Heather Morgan** (who rapped under the name "Razzlekhan").
They were not master criminal masterminds hiding in a bunker; they were living in Wall Street, posting cringe rap videos on TikTok ("Crocodile of Wall Street").

## The Laundering

They tried to wash the money through:
- Buying NFTs.
- Buying Walmart gift cards.
- Using "Peel chains" (moving small amounts thousands of times).
But the blockchain never forgets. The feds traced the funds to a cloud storage account owned by Lichtenstein. Inside was a file with the private keys to the stolen billions.
