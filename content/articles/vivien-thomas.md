## Summary

Vivien Thomas was an African-American surgical technician who developed the Blalock-Taussig shunt procedure for treating "blue baby" syndrome. Despite having no medical degree, his surgical skill and experimental work at Johns Hopkins were instrumental in developing the life-saving procedure. Racial barriers prevented him from receiving credit for decades until he was eventually awarded an honorary doctorate.
