## Summary

Hilde Mangold performed the groundbreaking experiment demonstrating the organizer effect in embryonic development in 1921. Her work showed that a small region of an embryo could induce a second body axis when transplanted, proving the existence of embryonic induction. She died tragically in a kitchen explosion at age 25, before the significance of her work was fully recognized.
