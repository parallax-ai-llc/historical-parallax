## Summary

Shin Dong-joo (Shigemitsu Hiroyuki) is the eldest son of Lotte founder Shin Kyuk-ho who lost a bitter succession battle to his younger brother Shin Dong-bin for control of Lotte Group. The family feud, which played out publicly in 2015, exposed the complex dual Korean-Japanese structure of Lotte. He attempted to seize control through legal challenges in both Japan and South Korea but ultimately lost. The dispute became a symbol of chaebol succession conflicts.
