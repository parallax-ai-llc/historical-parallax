## Summary

Dogen Zenji was a Japanese Zen Buddhist monk who founded the Soto Zen school in Japan. His masterwork Shobogenzo (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye) is one of the most profound philosophical texts in Japanese literature. He emphasized shikantaza (just sitting) meditation as itself the expression of enlightenment, not merely a means to it. His philosophy of time, being, and practice continues to influence philosophy worldwide.
