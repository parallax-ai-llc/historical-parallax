## Summary

José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer, ophthalmologist, and polymath who became the national hero of the Philippines.[^1] His literary works, particularly the novels *Noli Me Tángere* (1887) and *El Filibusterismo* (1891), exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and inspired the Philippine independence movement.[^2] Though he advocated peaceful reform rather than violent revolution, his execution by Spanish authorities on December 30, 1896, transformed him into a martyr whose death catalyzed the Philippine Revolution.[^3] A Renaissance man fluent in twenty-two languages, Rizal excelled not only in medicine and literature but also in sculpture, painting, science, and numerous other disciplines.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

José Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, to Francisco Rizal Mercado and Teodora Alonso y Quintos, the seventh of eleven children in a prosperous landed family.[^5] The Rizal family belonged to the *principalía* class—the ruling elite of their town—and lived a life of comfort and prosperity.[^6] His mother, Teodora, was educated, principled, and deeply religious, serving as his first teacher and encouraging his natural curiosity from an early age.[^7] Rizal showed intellectual and artistic promise as a young child, reportedly reading and writing by the age of five.[^8]

The family's Chinese-Filipino ancestry—Rizal's great-great-grandfather was Chinese—placed them within a complex social hierarchy in Spanish colonial Philippines.[^9] His older brother, Paciano, exposed him to progressive ideas and the early stirrings of reform, serving as a crucial intellectual influence.[^10] The Rizal household valued education and moral uprightness, creating a nurturing environment that shaped José's character and ambitions.[^11]

Rizal received his early education at home before entering Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1877 with the highest honors possible.[^12] At fifteen, he had already demonstrated exceptional academic abilities.[^13] To save his mother's failing eyesight—she was suffering from cataracts—he decided to study medicine at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila.[^14] This personal motivation to help his mother would drive his later specialization in ophthalmology.[^15]

The young Rizal's education exposed him to both the privileges and the constraints of colonial society. While the Spanish colonial system provided educational opportunities for the *ilustrado* class, it also enforced strict Catholic orthodoxy and maintained rigid hierarchies that limited Filipino autonomy.[^16] These early experiences of colonial inequality would profoundly shape Rizal's intellectual development and his later advocacy for reform.[^17]

## Rise to Prominence

In 1882, at age twenty-one, Rizal traveled to Spain to complete his medical degree, beginning a period of European sojourn that would fundamentally shape his worldview and political consciousness.[^18] He received his medical degree in 1884 from the Universidad Central de Madrid, followed by a degree in philosophy and letters at age twenty-four.[^19] He completed a second doctorate at the University of Heidelberg in Germany in 1887, specializing in ophthalmology.[^20]

While in Europe, Rizal trained under prominent ophthalmologists including Louis de Wecker in Paris and Otto Becker in Heidelberg, as well as working with Dr. Karl Ernest Schweigger in Berlin.[^21] On his travels through Europe, he visited and worked with other renowned specialists, including Ernst Fuchs in Vienna.[^22] This training transformed him into what contemporaries described as an excellent and tireless ophthalmologist.[^23] He successfully operated on his mother's left eye, restoring her ability to read and write.[^24]

Beyond his medical pursuits, Rizal became a key figure in the Propaganda Movement, a reformist campaign led by Filipino students and expatriates in Spain advocating for political, religious, and economic reforms in the Philippines.[^25] He contributed essays, allegories, poems, and editorials to the Spanish newspaper *La Solidaridad* in Barcelona, using pen names including "Dimasalang," "Laong Laan," and "May Pagasa."[^26] His articles addressed critical issues facing the Filipino people, including "Los Agricultores Filipinos" (The Filipino Farmers) and his influential essay series "Filipinas dentro de cien años" (The Philippines Within One Hundred Years), published in multiple installments in 1889-1890.[^27]

While in Berlin in 1887, Rizal published his groundbreaking novel *Noli Me Tángere* (Latin for "Touch Me Not"), a searing critique of Spanish colonial rule and the Catholic Church's complicity in oppression.[^28] The novel exposed the inequities in law and practice in the treatment of Filipinos by the colonial government and Spanish Catholic friars.[^29] Written originally in Spanish, the work would later be published in Tagalog and English, becoming foundational to Filipino national consciousness.[^30] The Spanish authorities immediately recognized the book's subversive power, and it was banned in the Philippines along with its sequel.[^31]

In 1891, while in Belgium, Rizal published his second novel, *El Filibusterismo* (The Subversive, also known as *The Reign of Greed*), which continued the story of *Noli Me Tángere* with a darker, more revolutionary tone.[^32] These two novels became the national epic of the Philippines, inspiring both peaceful reformists and armed revolutionaries alike.[^33] The core of Rizal's writings centered on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom—specifically, rights for the Filipino people.[^34]

## Major Achievements

### Literary Masterworks and Cultural Impact

Rizal's two novels represent his most significant achievements in shaping Filipino national consciousness. *Noli Me Tángere* (1887) satirized the Spanish clergy and colonial administrators, exposing systemic corruption and abuse through the story of Crisóstomo Ibarra and his attempts to reform Philippine society.[^35] The novel's publication established Rizal's reputation as a courageous voice for reform and made him a target of colonial authorities.[^36]

*El Filibusterismo* (1891), darker and more pessimistic than its predecessor, depicted the protagonist Simoun's attempts to foment revolution, reflecting Rizal's growing disillusionment with the possibility of peaceful reform.[^37] Together, these works formed what literary scholars consider the nucleus of Philippine literature and inspired generations of Filipinos to fight for independence.[^38] So significant were these novels that the Philippine government later passed Republic Act No. 1425, mandating their study in all schools, colleges, and universities.[^39]

Beyond novels, Rizal produced poetry that has endured as expressions of Filipino identity and aspiration. His final work, "Mi Último Adiós" (My Last Farewell), composed on the night before his execution, December 29, 1896, stands as one of the most important works in Philippine literature.[^40] Written without title, signature, or date, the poem was hidden in a small alcohol stove and discovered by his family after his execution.[^41] The poem has been translated into forty-six Philippine languages and at least thirty-five English versions, with the 1911 Charles Derbyshire translation being the most popular.[^42]

### Founding La Liga Filipina and Political Activism

On July 3, 1892, shortly after returning to the Philippines, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina in Manila, a civic organization designed to unite Filipinos in pressing for peaceful reforms within the Spanish colonial system.[^43] The organization's aims included uniting the archipelago into one compact, vigorous body; encouraging education, agriculture, and commerce; and studying and applying reforms.[^44] La Liga was structured as a mutual aid and self-help society, with members paying monthly dues to build a fund for scholarships, legal aid, small-capital loans, and cooperatives.[^45]

The Liga's goals reflected Rizal's belief in institutional reform rather than violent revolution. He advocated for equal treatment of Filipinos, limiting the power of Spanish friars, and representation for the Philippines in the Spanish Cortes (Spain's parliament).[^46] However, Spanish authorities viewed the organization as a threat to colonial stability.[^47] Within days of La Liga's founding, Rizal was arrested and exiled to Dapitan in northwest Mindanao, disrupting the organization but not extinguishing the movement it represented.[^48]

After Rizal's arrest, La Liga membership split into two factions: conservatives who formed the Cuerpo de Compromisarios to continue supporting *La Solidaridad*, and radicals led by Andrés Bonifacio who founded the Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society.[^49] The Katipunan's founding date of July 7, 1892—just days after Rizal's arrest—demonstrates how La Liga's suppression catalyzed the transition from reform to revolution.[^50]

### Accomplishments During Dapitan Exile (1892-1896)

Rizal's four-year exile in Dapitan, far from silencing him, became a period of remarkable productivity and community service. He established a school in 1893 that began with three pupils and eventually grew to twenty-one students, teaching reading, writing in Spanish and English, geography, history, mathematics, industrial work, nature study, morals, and gymnastics.[^51] He resumed his medical practice as an ophthalmologist and general physician, charging foreigners according to their means while treating townspeople for free.[^52]

As an engineer, Rizal designed and constructed a waterworks system for Dapitan with the help of his pupils, providing year-round water supply for his farm and household needs.[^53] In 1895, he inaugurated the Linao waterworks and operated the Talisay dam.[^54] He drained marshes to eliminate malaria-carrying mosquitoes and provided a lighting system using coconut oil lamps posted in dark streets.[^55]

His scientific contributions during this period earned him lasting recognition in natural history. Several species he collected were named in his honor, including *Draco rizali* (flying lizard), *Rhacophorus rizali* (tree frog), and *Apogonia rizali* (beetle).[^56] He built up a rich collection of 346 shells representing 203 species.[^57] He also engaged in profitable business ventures, partnering with Ramon Carreon in fishing, copra, and hemp industries.[^58]

### Mastery of Multiple Disciplines

Rizal's achievements extend far beyond any single field, establishing him as one of history's most remarkable polymaths. He was conversant in twenty-two languages, mastering Filipino, Spanish, Latin, Greek, English, French, German, Italian, and numerous other European and Asian tongues.[^59] His German friend, Adolf Bernhard Meyer, described Rizal's abilities as "stupendous."[^60]

He excelled as an ophthalmologist, sculptor, painter, educator, farmer, historian, playwright, and journalist.[^61] He dabbled with varying degrees of expertise in architecture, cartography, economics, ethnology, anthropology, sociology, dramatics, martial arts, fencing, and pistol shooting.[^62] His scientific work encompassed anthropology, archaeology, ethnology, ichthyology, ophthalmology, medicine, and zoology.[^63] Documented studies confirm Rizal's ability to master various skills and subjects, making him not only the Philippines' national hero but one of history's most accomplished polymaths.[^64]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Retraction Controversy

The most contentious controversy surrounding Rizal involves an alleged retraction letter dated December 29, 1896—one day before his execution—in which he supposedly recanted his criticisms of the Catholic Church and condemned Freemasonry.[^65] The document, reportedly found by Fr. Manuel Garcia in 1935, sparked intense debates because it seemed fundamentally inconsistent with Rizal's character as a champion of reason and critic of religious authority.[^66]

Scholars including Ricardo Pascual questioned the document's authenticity, claiming it was not in Rizal's handwriting.[^67] Many historians believe the Jesuits' claim to possess the original retraction was intended to protect the Catholic Church's reputation by showing that Rizal "returned" to the faith before death, thereby diminishing the anti-clerical impact of his writings.[^68] The retraction controversy remains unresolved, with some academics accepting it as genuine and others rejecting it as fabrication.[^69]

The alleged retraction reportedly occurred hours before Rizal's execution at Fort Santiago and supposedly permitted him to marry Josephine Bracken in an ecclesiastical ceremony.[^70] However, some sectors, including members of Rizal's own family, dispute this marriage because no verifiable records of the union have been found.[^71]

### Questions About American Sponsorship of His Hero Status

Another significant controversy involves claims that José Rizal was designated as the national hero through American intervention rather than organic Filipino choice.[^72] Some historians suggest that Governor General William Howard Taft in 1901 recommended that the U.S.-sponsored Philippine Commission name Rizal as the national hero for Filipinos.[^73]

According to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, however, no Filipino historical figure—including Rizal—was officially declared a national hero through law or executive order.[^74] This controversy feeds into broader debates about whether Rizal's moderate, reformist approach was promoted by American colonial authorities to discourage more radical revolutionary nationalism exemplified by figures like Andrés Bonifacio.[^75]

### Elitism and Limited Popular Reach

Critics have long noted that Rizal was a member of the wealthy *ilustrado* elite class, had lived abroad for nearly as long as he had lived in the Philippines, and wrote primarily in Spanish rather than Tagalog or Cebuano.[^76] Most historians agree that the majority of Filipinos were unaware of Rizal during his lifetime due to his elite status and his use of a language inaccessible to the masses.[^77]

This elitism raises questions about Rizal's connection to ordinary Filipinos and whether his advocacy truly represented the aspirations of the broader population. His privileged background and European education placed him in a fundamentally different social position from the peasants and workers who bore the brunt of colonial exploitation.[^78]

### Ambiguity on Revolution and Violence

Confusion over Rizal's actual stance on armed revolution remains a source of debate and criticism. In *Noli Me Tángere*, he appears to oppose violence, while *El Filibusterismo* seems to advocate for more radical action.[^79] Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno described Rizal as "a soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it," pivoting between fear and hope, between faith and despair.[^80]

Historian Teodoro Agoncillo argued that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not "the leader of its liberation forces," suggesting that Andrés Bonifacio—who led the Katipunan and initiated armed revolution—should be honored alongside or instead of Rizal.[^81] This criticism reflects a broader question: Should a nation's premier hero be someone who advocated restraint and peaceful reform, or someone who led the armed struggle for independence?[^82]

Although Rizal had no connections with the Katipunan and had taken no part in the 1896 insurrection, he was arrested and tried for sedition by the military, found guilty, and executed.[^83] His distance from the actual revolutionary movement yet his designation as the national hero strikes some as historically incongruous.[^84]

### Unresolved Debates

Many Filipinos maintain an ambivalent or uncertain attitude toward José Rizal and his heroism.[^85] The issues and controversies surrounding his status as national hero have not reached resolution and continue to generate scholarly debate.[^86] These ongoing discussions reflect the complexity of assessing historical figures who operated in morally ambiguous colonial contexts and whose legacies serve diverse political purposes.[^87]

## Personal Life

### Family Relationships

Rizal maintained close relationships with his large family throughout his life. His parents, Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso, had eleven children: Saturnina, Paciano, Narcisa, Olympia, Lucia, Maria, Jose (nicknamed "Pepe"), Concepcion, Josefa, Trinidad, and Soledad.[^88] Only Concepcion died in childhood.[^89] His brother Paciano was a major influence, having witnessed abuses by Spanish authorities and being actively involved in reform movements.[^90]

Rizal's mother, Teodora, had a particularly strong influence on his development, and her failing eyesight due to cataracts motivated his decision to become an ophthalmologist.[^91] His successful surgery on her left eye, restoring her ability to read and write, represented a deeply personal triumph.[^92]

### Romantic Relationships

Rizal's personal life included multiple romantic relationships, reflecting both his charm and the constraints of his political situation. He wrote about nine women who have been identified in his life: Gertrude Beckett of London; Nelly Boustead of an English-Iberian merchant family; Seiko Usui (O-Sei-san), last descendant of a noble Japanese family; Segunda Katigbak; Leonor Valenzuela; and Leonor Rivera, a distant cousin with whom he had an eight-year romantic relationship.[^93]

Leonor Rivera was particularly significant in Rizal's emotional life. Their relationship ended when Leonor's mother hid letters from Rizal and arranged a marriage for her with Henry Kipping, partly because of the bad reputation Rizal had gained in the Philippines for writing *Noli Me Tángere*.[^94] This loss deeply affected Rizal and influenced the romantic dimensions of his literary work.[^95]

### Marriage to Josephine Bracken

Marie Josephine Leopoldine Bracken became Rizal's common-law wife during his exile in Dapitan.[^96] They lived together as husband and wife in Talisay, Dapitan, though their relationship faced significant obstacles.[^97] They applied to marry, but because of Rizal's reputation from his writings and political stance, the local priest Father Obach would only perform the ceremony if Rizal could obtain permission from the Bishop of Cebu.[^98] When Rizal refused to return to practicing Catholicism, the bishop refused permission for an ecclesiastical marriage.[^99]

The couple had a son, but the child lived only a few hours after birth. Rizal named him Francisco after his own father.[^100] This tragedy added to the hardships of their relationship.[^101]

Hours before Rizal's execution on December 30, 1896, the couple were allegedly married at Fort Santiago following Rizal's alleged reconciliation with the Catholic Church through the controversial retraction.[^102] However, some sectors, including members of Rizal's family, dispute the marriage because no verifiable records have been found regarding the union.[^103]

### Personality and Character

Contemporaries described Rizal as intellectually curious, disciplined, and remarkably talented across multiple domains. His ability to master languages, sciences, arts, and practical skills reflected not only innate genius but also extraordinary dedication and work ethic.[^104] His writings reveal a man torn between idealism and pragmatism, between faith in peaceful reform and despair over colonial intransigence.[^105]

Despite his accomplishments, Rizal maintained humility and a sense of service to his people. During his Dapitan exile, he treated poor patients for free while charging wealthy foreigners, demonstrating a commitment to social justice beyond mere rhetoric.[^106] His establishment of a school and community development projects showed a practical commitment to uplifting his fellow Filipinos.[^107]

## Legacy

### Martyrdom and National Awakening

José Rizal's execution on December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan Field (now Rizal Park) transformed him from a reformist intellectual into a national martyr whose death galvanized the Philippine independence movement.[^108] A firing party of eight Filipino soldiers formed the front rank, with a backup line of Spanish troops behind them ready to shoot the executioners should they fail to obey orders.[^109] Ordered to face away as befit a traitor, Rizal asked to face the firing squad but was refused; at the instant of the volley, he twisted as he fell so that he landed facing upward.[^110] Multiple accounts record his last words as "Consummatum est" (It is finished).[^111]

The Spanish were so fearful of public mutiny that they executed Rizal an hour earlier than scheduled, but December 30, 1896, proved to be a pivotal turning point that activated a full-scale revolution.[^112] His martyrdom convinced Filipinos that there was no alternative to independence from Spain, stiffening the will of the revolutionary movement already in the field.[^113] His death made "permanent retention of power by Spain clearly impossible."[^114]

The Philippine Revolution, inspired by Rizal's writings and catalyzed by his execution, ultimately led to the Philippine Declaration of Independence in 1898.[^115] Today, December 30 is observed as Rizal Day, one of the most important national holidays in the Philippines.[^116]

### Educational and Cultural Impact

Rizal's legacy permeates Philippine education and culture. Republic Act No. 1425, known as the Rizal Law, requires that *Noli Me Tángere* and *El Filibusterismo* be read by all high school students throughout the country.[^117] University courses on "The Life and Works of Rizal" are mandatory in Philippine higher education, ensuring that each generation encounters his ideas and his example.[^118]

His ideas, principles, and sacrifices continue to resonate with Filipinos, inspiring subsequent generations to strive for freedom, democracy, and social justice.[^119] Rizal's patriotism and his standing as one of Asia's first intellectuals have inspired recognition of the importance of national identity to nation-building.[^120] He serves as a beacon not only for Filipinos but for oppressed peoples worldwide seeking self-determination.[^121]

### Monuments and Global Recognition

The Rizal Monument in Manila's Rizal Park (formerly Bagumbayan Field, the site of his execution) stands as the principal memorial to the national hero.[^122] The monument, with its original title *Motto Stella* (Latin for "guiding star"), consists of a standing bronze sculpture of Rizal holding his two famous novels, with an obelisk set on a stone base within which his remains are interred.[^123] During its centenary in 2013, the monument was declared a national cultural treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines and a national monument by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines.[^124]

Rizal's recognition extends far beyond the Philippines. Monuments to him stand in eight U.S. cities including Juneau, Alaska; Hawaii; Chicago; Orlando; California; New Jersey; New York City; and Seattle.[^125] International monuments include a near-exact replica of the Manila monument in Madrid, Spain; a monument in Jinjiang, China, standing 18.61 feet high (symbolizing his birth year of 1861); memorials in Singapore; and statues across four continents in Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America.[^126]

The proliferation of Rizal monuments globally reflects not only the Filipino diaspora's reverence for their national hero but also international recognition of his significance as an anti-colonial intellectual and champion of human rights.[^127] Visiting heads of state to the Philippines customarily lay wreaths at the Rizal Monument, demonstrating the diplomatic significance of his legacy.[^128]

### Continuing Relevance

Contemporary scholars continue to explore new dimensions of Rizal's relevance. Recent academic work, including Andreas T. Zanker's 2024 study "'I Enter the Future with the Memory of the Past': José Rizal, the Philippines and Classical Antiquity," examines Rizal's engagement with classical learning and its influence on his political thought.[^129] Other recent scholarship claims Rizal was a pioneer of Philippine futures thinking and foresight, examining his intellectual exercises and character traits.[^130]

Academic perspectives in 2024-2025 continue to describe Rizal as a pivotal figure who emerges as a symbol of enlightenment, resilience, and national identity, born during Spanish colonial rule as a versatile nationalist and reformist.[^131] The mandatory Life and Works of Rizal courses in Philippine universities ensure that new generations engage critically with his legacy, including international students who gain insight into Philippine history and values through studying his life.[^132]

Rizal's writings remain touchstones for discussions of colonialism, nationalism, reform versus revolution, and the role of intellectuals in social change. His famous quotes continue to inspire: "He who does not know how to look back at where he came from will never get to his destination" and "The youth is the hope of our future" are regularly cited in Philippine discourse.[^133]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and defenders of Rizal emphasize his role as a pioneering anti-colonial intellectual who used literature and peaceful advocacy to challenge oppressive structures. Leon Ma. Guerrero refers to Rizal as "the First Filipino," recognizing him as the figure who most fully articulated a unified Filipino national identity transcending regional and linguistic divisions.[^134]

Supporters highlight Rizal's multifaceted genius—his mastery of languages, sciences, arts, and medicine—as evidence of the intellectual capacity of Filipinos at a time when colonial ideology presumed racial inferiority.[^135] His academic achievements in European universities demonstrated that Filipinos could excel on equal terms with Europeans, undermining racist justifications for colonial rule.[^136]

Admirers of Rizal emphasize his moral courage in publishing *Noli Me Tángere* and *El Filibusterismo*, knowing that these works would make him a target of colonial authorities.[^137] His willingness to face execution rather than remain silent exemplifies principled commitment to truth and justice.[^138] The fact that he composed "Mi Último Adiós" on the eve of his execution, expressing love for his country and hope for its future, demonstrates extraordinary moral strength.[^139]

Defenders also point to Rizal's practical work during his Dapitan exile—establishing schools, providing medical care, developing infrastructure, and conducting scientific research—as evidence that he was not merely a theorist but someone committed to concrete improvement of Filipino lives.[^140] His advocacy for education, legal reform, and economic development reflected a comprehensive vision for national progress.[^141]

Scholars appreciate Rizal's nuanced critique of colonialism, which targeted not only Spanish political oppression but also the Catholic Church's institutional power and the passivity of Filipinos themselves.[^142] His call for Filipinos to take responsibility for their own liberation—expressed in his statement "There can be no tyrants where there are no slaves"—reflects a sophisticated understanding of how oppression operates through both external force and internal acquiescence.[^143]

### Negative Views

Critics of Rizal's heroic status emphasize his privileged background, elite education, and limited connection to the masses who bore the brunt of colonial exploitation.[^144] Historian Teodoro Agoncillo's observation that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not "the leader of its liberation forces" reflects discomfort with elevating a peaceful reformist over revolutionary leaders.[^145]

Some scholars argue that Rizal's moderate approach and his advocacy for reform within the Spanish colonial system represented a conservative position that delayed more radical action necessary for independence.[^146] His opposition to the Katipunan and armed revolution, from this perspective, placed him on the wrong side of history.[^147] The fact that he was executed despite having no connection to the 1896 insurrection and having explicitly opposed violent methods underscores the futility of his reformist strategy.[^148]

Critics point to the alleged American promotion of Rizal as national hero as evidence that his legacy serves conservative political purposes—encouraging peaceful, moderate approaches to social change rather than revolutionary transformation.[^149] This interpretation suggests that Rizal's canonization serves elite interests by promoting a model of change that does not threaten existing power structures.[^150]

The retraction controversy, from a critical perspective, either reveals Rizal's ultimate lack of commitment to his stated principles (if the retraction was genuine) or demonstrates the Catholic Church's willingness to fabricate documents to undermine his legacy (if it was forged).[^151] Either interpretation complicates the heroic narrative.[^152]

Some critics view Rizal's personal life—his multiple romantic relationships, his cosmopolitan lifestyle in Europe, his use of Spanish rather than native languages—as evidence of disconnection from authentic Filipino culture and identity.[^153] His embrace of European Enlightenment values, from this nationalist perspective, represented cultural colonization rather than genuine liberation.[^154]

Miguel de Unamuno's characterization of Rizal as "a soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it" captures critics' view that he was fundamentally ambivalent and conflicted, lacking the clarity and commitment necessary for true revolutionary leadership.[^155] The contradiction between *Noli Me Tángere*'s advocacy of peaceful reform and *El Filibusterismo*'s darker, more revolutionary tone reflects this internal conflict.[^156]

Contemporary scholars note that many Filipinos maintain ambivalent attitudes toward Rizal, suggesting that the debates over his heroism remain unresolved and contentious.[^157] The fact that his status as national hero was never formally legislated but rather evolved through custom and practice reflects the contested nature of his legacy.[^158]
