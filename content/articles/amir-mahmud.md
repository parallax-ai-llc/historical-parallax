## Summary

General (Ret.) Amir Machmud (21 February 1923 – 21 April 1995) was an Indonesian military general and politician who played a pivotal role in the transfer of power from President Sukarno to General Suharto through his involvement in the signing of the Supersemar document on 11 March 1966.[^1] Serving as Minister of Home Affairs from 1969 to 1982, he earned the nickname "The Bulldozer" for his tough stance against government opponents and dissidents.[^2] He later became Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) and Speaker of the People's Representative Council (DPR) from 1982 to 1987, during which he presided over the awarding of the "Father of Development" title to Suharto.[^3] His career spanned Indonesia's independence struggle, the Indonesian National Revolution, and the authoritarian New Order regime.

## Early Life and Background

Amir Machmud was born on 21 February 1923 in Cimahi, West Java, during the Dutch colonial period.[^4] He was the second of five siblings in a family with modest means. His father, Atang, worked as an employee for a public company owned by the Dutch colonial government, while his mother, Ganirah, whose name was later immortalized as the name of a street in Cimahi, raised the family during a tumultuous period in Indonesian history.[^5]

Growing up in the colonial era, Machmud received his education at the "Ardjoena" Hollandsch-Inlandsche School in Bandung, a Dutch-Native school that served the indigenous population under colonial rule. He graduated in 1938 at the age of fifteen.[^6] Demonstrating early technical aptitude, he continued his education at a technical school for two additional years. In 1941, just before the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies, he took a topography course, which would later prove valuable in his military career.[^7]

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia in 1942 fundamentally altered the trajectory of Machmud's life. By 1943, the Japanese Imperial Army had established the Defenders of the Homeland (PETA), a volunteer auxiliary force designed to assist Japanese forces against a possible Allied invasion. In 1943, the eighteen-year-old Machmud joined PETA, receiving his first military training and remaining a member until 1945.[^8] This organization would prove instrumental in Indonesia's independence struggle, as former PETA officers and troops, including future presidents like Suharto and General Sudirman, formed the core of the fledgling Indonesian National Armed Forces after independence.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Following the proclamation of Indonesian independence by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta on 17 August 1945, Amir Machmud joined the Indonesian revolutionary forces with enthusiasm and dedication.[^10] The Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) announced the establishment of the People's Security Body (BKR), and Machmud was appointed to head a unit in Lembang, West Java, demonstrating the trust placed in him by revolutionary leaders despite his youth.[^11]

In 1946, after the People's Security Army (TKR) had been established as Indonesia's formal military organization, the Lembang BKR unit was integrated into the legendary Siliwangi Division, the military regional command responsible for the security of West Java.[^12] From May 1946, the division was commanded by then-Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution, with Umar Wirahadikusumah as his adjutant, and slightly later Machmud served as the Division Commander's Chief of Staff, a position of significant responsibility.[^13]

The Siliwangi Division faced its greatest test during the tumultuous years following the Renville Agreement of 1948. Under this agreement, the Indonesian government was forced to recognize territories that had been taken under Dutch control, including West Java. The Siliwangi Division was consequently forced to leave its home territory and relocate to Central Java under Colonel Nasution's command.[^14] When the Dutch launched Operation Kraai in December 1948, swiftly capturing the Indonesian provisional capital at Yogyakarta, the Siliwangi Division conducted a fighting retreat back to West Java, where its soldiers had their social networks and were familiar with the terrain, making it ideal for guerrilla warfare.[^15]

After the Indonesian War of Independence concluded with Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, Machmud remained with the Siliwangi Territorial and Army command until 1960, ending his time in direct command of troops in Bandung.[^16] Recognizing the need for military officers to understand political and economic affairs, he studied at the Army Staff College (Seskoad), where he learned about politics and economics—subjects deemed essential for soldiers in an army increasingly involved in running the government. It was during this period that he became acquainted with Suharto, a connection that would prove crucial to his later career.[^17]

## Major Achievements

On 5 September 1962, Amir Machmud was appointed Commander of KODAM X/Lambung Mangkurat, which was responsible for the security of South Kalimantan. He held this post until 1965, marking his first stint as a Regional Commander.[^18] In December 1965, following the failed coup attempt of 30 September 1965 (the G30S/PKI movement), Machmud was appointed Commander of KODAM V/Jaya, making him responsible for the security of Jakarta and its surrounding areas during one of the most critical periods in Indonesian history.[^19]

As Suharto began gathering political support and momentum to challenge Sukarno's authority, Machmud's position as Jakarta commander placed him at the center of power. During this period, there was a duality to his stance—politically he aligned with Suharto, the Army, and anti-Sukarno protesters, while professionally feeling responsible to prevent Jakarta from descending into chaos.[^20]

The most significant event of Machmud's career occurred on 11 March 1966. On that day, President Sukarno was advised to leave a cabinet meeting and flew by helicopter to the presidential palace in Bogor, 60 km south of Jakarta, after student demonstrations protected by the army took place while troops without insignia surrounded the presidential palace.[^21] Major General Basuki Rahmat (Minister for Veterans Affairs), Brigadier General Mohammad Jusuf (Minister for Basic Industry), and Brigadier General Amir Machmud traveled to Bogor Palace. Machmud suggested that Sukarno give Suharto some powers to govern Indonesia jointly so that security could be maintained.[^22] The three generals persuaded Sukarno to sign what became known as Supersemar (Eleventh of March Order), which gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.[^23] On the way back to Jakarta, Machmud asked to read the document and seemed shocked to discover that it was effectively a handover of power to Suharto.[^24]

In early 1969, when Basuki Rahmat died suddenly, Machmud was transferred from his position as Commander of KODAM V/Jaya to succeed him as Minister of Home Affairs. He was officially appointed on 22 January 1969 and sworn in on 28 January 1969.[^25] During his thirteen-year tenure as Minister of Home Affairs (1969-1982), Machmud became one of the most powerful figures in the Suharto regime. He established a General Election Board in mid-1969, which he headed personally.[^26] In 1971, he was instrumental in forming the Republic of Indonesia Civil Servants Corps (KORPRI), which was established by Presidential decree in November 1971, bringing all civil servants into an organizational framework totally controlled by the Minister of Home Affairs.[^27] KORPRI was integrated into Golkar, and during elections, KORPRI's two million members were obliged to campaign on behalf of Golkar.[^28] He supervised the Legislative Elections of 1971, 1977, and 1982, ensuring Golkar's dominance in each contest.[^29]

## Controversies and Criticisms

During his tenure as Minister of Home Affairs, Amir Machmud developed a notorious reputation for authoritarian practices and earned the nickname "The Bulldozer" for being tough on government opponents and dissidents.[^30] He helped strengthen Suharto's control over Indonesia through systematic political repression and the creation of mechanisms to ensure regime loyalty.[^31]

In 1969, Machmud implemented a controversial policy that banned civil servants from being involved in politics while simultaneously encouraging them to vote for Golkar in Legislative Elections as a sign of loyalty to the government.[^32] This created an ostensibly "neutral" bureaucracy that was effectively mobilized to support the ruling party, violating democratic principles of civil service independence and freedom of association.

The establishment of KORPRI in 1971 represented a fundamental violation of workers' rights. Civil servants were required to cease membership in independent trade unions, which were dissolved, and were compelled to join KORPRI.[^33] Created as a means to ensure political control of Indonesia's bureaucracy, KORPRI functioned as a support mechanism to Golkar, the ruling party of the period.[^34] This system eliminated civil servants' freedom of association and turned the entire bureaucracy into a political machine for the New Order regime.

As Minister of Home Affairs, Machmud was tasked, along with Suharto's personal assistant and the internal security organization Kopkamtib, with ensuring Golkar won elections.[^35] This involved systematic manipulation of electoral processes, intimidation of opposition parties, and mobilization of state resources for partisan purposes. The elections held under his supervision in 1971, 1977, and 1982 were widely criticized for lacking genuine democratic competition, with Golkar's victories predetermined through state intervention.

While specific documentation of human rights violations during his tenure is limited in available sources, his reputation as "The Bulldozer" suggests a pattern of harsh treatment toward political dissidents and government critics during a period when the New Order regime was consolidating authoritarian control.[^36] His role in strengthening Suharto's grip on power made him complicit in the broader human rights abuses and democratic backsliding that characterized the New Order era.

## Personal Life

Amir Machmud maintained a relatively private personal life despite his prominent public role. He was married and had a family that remained largely out of the public spotlight throughout his career.[^37] When he died on 21 April 1995, he left behind a wife whose name is not widely documented in public sources, two children, and ten grandchildren, suggesting a close-knit extended family.[^38]

Born and raised in Cimahi, West Java, Machmud maintained connections to his hometown throughout his life. His mother's name, Ganirah, was immortalized as the name of a street in Cimahi, reflecting the family's local significance.[^39] The city also named a street after the general himself—Jalan Jenderal Amir Machmud—honoring his position as a prominent son of Cimahi who rose to national prominence.[^40]

Machmud's personality, as reflected in his nickname "The Bulldozer," suggests a forceful, determined individual who pursued objectives with single-minded intensity. His willingness to implement authoritarian measures as Minister of Home Affairs indicates a pragmatic approach to power and a strong loyalty to Suharto and the New Order regime. His shock upon reading the Supersemar document suggests he may not have fully understood the implications of the mission he was undertaking to Bogor Palace, though he subsequently became one of Suharto's most loyal supporters.[^41]

As a military man who spent his formative years in the independence struggle, Machmud represented a generation of Indonesian officers who transitioned from revolutionary fighters to administrators of an authoritarian state. His education at Seskoad in politics and economics reflected the Indonesian military's doctrine of dwifungsi (dual function), which justified military involvement in civilian governance.[^42]

## Legacy

Amir Machmud's legacy remains deeply contested in Indonesian historical memory. He died on 21 April 1995, during the final years of Suharto's New Order regime, and was buried at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery (Taman Makam Pahlawan Kalibata) in Jakarta, an honor reserved for those deemed national heroes and significant military figures.[^43]

For supporters of the New Order, Machmud represents a generation of military leaders who brought stability to Indonesia after the chaotic transition from Sukarno to Suharto. His role in the Supersemar event is viewed by this perspective as having prevented potential civil war and saved Indonesia from communist influence following the 1965 coup attempt. His thirteen years as Minister of Home Affairs are credited with establishing administrative structures that supported Indonesia's economic development during the 1970s and early 1980s.

His instrumental role in creating KORPRI and managing elections is seen by regime defenders as having provided political stability that enabled economic growth. The period of his service coincided with significant infrastructure development and poverty reduction in Indonesia, achievements that Suharto's supporters attribute to the political control that figures like Machmud helped establish.

However, for critics and advocates of democracy, Machmud's legacy is far more problematic. His tenure as Minister of Home Affairs represents the systematic dismantling of democratic institutions and the consolidation of authoritarian control. The nickname "The Bulldozer" symbolizes the ruthless suppression of dissent and opposition that characterized the New Order regime. His creation of KORPRI violated workers' fundamental rights to freedom of association and transformed the civil service into a partisan political machine.

The electoral manipulations conducted under his supervision undermined Indonesia's democratic development and entrenched single-party dominance for decades. His role in strengthening Suharto's control contributed to a regime that would ultimately be responsible for widespread human rights abuses, corruption, and the suppression of political freedoms until its collapse in 1998.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and commentators sympathetic to the New Order emphasize Machmud's role in preventing chaos during Indonesia's turbulent transition period in the mid-1960s. His position as Commander of KODAM V/Jaya during the critical months following the 1965 coup attempt placed him in a position to either maintain order or allow Jakarta to descend into violence, and he chose the former.[^44] This perspective credits him with pragmatic leadership during a genuine crisis.

Defenders point to his long military service dating back to the independence struggle as evidence of his dedication to Indonesia. His participation in PETA during the Japanese occupation, his service with the Siliwangi Division during the Indonesian National Revolution, and his role in the division's famous march back to West Java during Operation Kraai are cited as evidence of his patriotism and military competence.[^45]

Some analysts argue that the administrative systems Machmud established, including KORPRI, while authoritarian, provided organizational capacity that enabled the Indonesian government to implement development programs across the archipelago. The Suharto regime's economic achievements in poverty reduction and infrastructure development during the 1970s and 1980s are sometimes attributed in part to the political stability that figures like Machmud helped create.

His role as MPR Chairman from 1982 to 1987 is viewed by some as having provided institutional continuity during Indonesia's ongoing development. During his chairmanship, the MPR awarded Suharto the title of "Father of Development" on 9 March 1983, reflecting the regime's narrative of prioritizing economic progress over political liberalization.[^46]

### Negative Views

Critics and pro-democracy scholars view Amir Machmud as a key architect of Indonesia's authoritarian New Order system. His reputation as "The Bulldozer" and his acknowledged toughness on government opponents and dissidents represent systematic political repression that violated human rights and democratic principles.[^47] These critics argue that whatever stability he provided came at an unacceptable cost in terms of political freedom and human dignity.

The creation of KORPRI is viewed by labor rights advocates and democracy activists as a fundamental violation of workers' freedom of association. By forcing civil servants to leave independent unions and join a government-controlled organization that served as a Golkar support mechanism, Machmud helped create a system of political control that corrupted the civil service and violated international labor standards.[^48]

Electoral experts and political scientists criticize Machmud's role in supervising the manipulated elections of 1971, 1977, and 1982. His responsibility for ensuring Golkar victories represents the antithesis of democratic governance, with elections serving as mere window-dressing for authoritarian control rather than genuine exercises in popular sovereignty.[^49] This electoral manipulation delayed Indonesia's democratic development by decades.

Scholars examining the New Order's legacy argue that figures like Machmud bear responsibility for creating and maintaining a system that enabled corruption, cronyism, and human rights abuses on a massive scale. While he may not have directly committed specific atrocities, his role in strengthening Suharto's control made him complicit in the regime's broader patterns of abuse. The nickname "The Bulldozer" suggests an approach to governance that prioritized control over rights and stability over justice.

Contemporary Indonesian historians increasingly contextualize Machmud within the broader pattern of military officers from the independence generation who became administrators of an authoritarian state, raising questions about how revolutionary ideals of freedom and independence became transformed into practices of repression and control.[^50]
