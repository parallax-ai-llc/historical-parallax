## Summary

Vijay Shekhar Sharma founded Paytm, India's largest digital payments platform. Paytm grew explosively after India's demonetization in 2016, which forced millions to adopt digital payments. The company expanded into financial services, banking, and commerce. Paytm's IPO in 2021 at $20 billion was India's largest tech listing, though the stock subsequently declined significantly.
