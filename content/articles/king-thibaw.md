## Summary

King Thibaw Min (1859-1916) was the last monarch of the Konbaung dynasty and the final king in Burmese history.[^1] Born a junior prince, he ascended the throne in 1878 following a bloody palace massacre that eliminated rival claimants.[^2] His brief seven-year reign ended when British forces conquered Upper Burma in 1885, leading to his forced abdication and 31 years of exile in Ratnagiri, India.[^3] Though portrayed by British colonial propaganda as a weak, despotic ruler, modern scholarship reveals a more complex figure who attempted reforms and sought to preserve Burmese independence against overwhelming imperial pressure.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Prince Thibaw was born Maung Yay Set on January 1, 1859, the son of King Mindon (r. 1853–1878) and one of his lesser consorts, Laungshe Mibaya.[^5] Among King Mindon's more than 70 sons by numerous consorts, Thibaw held a relatively insignificant position in the royal hierarchy.[^6] His mother had been banished from the palace court by Mindon and spent her final years as a thilashin, a female Burmese Buddhist renunciant, further diminishing young Thibaw's prospects at court.[^7]

As a junior prince, Thibaw's exposure to the Burmese court was limited compared to senior heirs.[^8] During his early years, he dedicated himself to studying Buddhist texts at a kyaung (monastery school) to win his father's favor and recognition.[^9] His religious devotion proved genuine and profound—he passed the Pahtamabyan religious examinations, demonstrating proficiency in Buddhist scriptures and the Pali language, which earned him respect from his father and the chief queen.[^10]

Thibaw briefly attended a Christian missionary school in Mandalay, where observers described him as "a quiet, inoffensive, docile lad" lacking distinguishing vices or virtues and easily influenced.[^11] This characterization would later be used to portray him as a weak ruler susceptible to manipulation, though it may simply have reflected his scholarly, introspective temperament. Contemporary historians viewed him as "a goodhearted, even-tempered young man easily influenced by those around him—in other words a puppet to be manipulated by them."[^12]

Thibaw was a pious student of Buddhist religion and was not entirely keen on becoming king in the first place, preferring his religious studies to political intrigue.[^13] His ascension to the throne would come not through merit or ambition, but through the machinations of powerful figures at court who saw in him a malleable candidate they could control.

---

## Rise to Power

Thibaw's unexpected path to the throne began with the scheming of Queen Hsinbyumashin, one of King Mindon's chief consorts and the Queen of the Middle Palace.[^14] As King Mindon's health declined in 1878, intense rivalry erupted among the numerous princes and their mothers over the succession. Hsinbyumashin conspired with the prime minister, Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung, to secure the succession for Prince Thibaw, who was in love with her middle daughter, Supayalat.[^15]

The queen initially planned to arrange a marriage between Thibaw and her eldest daughter, Supayagyi, but Thibaw declared his love for the younger Supayalat instead.[^16] In a dramatic move during the anointing ceremony, Supayalat positioned herself to be crowned alongside or in precedence to her sister, ensuring her marriage to Thibaw was consummated while Supayagyi's remained unfulfilled.[^17] Supayalat and Thibaw were 19 and 20 years old respectively when they ascended the Lion Throne.[^18]

King Mindon died on October 1, 1878, and after two days, Thibaw was proclaimed king.[^19] What followed became one of the darkest episodes in Burmese royal history. Under the guise that Mindon wanted to bid his children farewell, Queen Hsinbyumashin had all royals of close age who could potentially become heirs to the throne mercilessly slaughtered by edict, to ensure that Thibaw and Supayalat would assume and hold the throne unchallenged.[^20]

The massacre unfolded over three days in February 1879: five royal relatives were killed on February 13, nineteen members of the royal family were executed on February 15, and another nineteen were killed the following night.[^21] Some victims had their throats crushed with bamboo poles while others were killed by sword.[^22] Estimates of the total death toll range from around 40 to over 80 princes and princesses.[^23]

The question of responsibility for this atrocity remains debated. Historical evidence indicates that Queen Hsinbyumashin and senior ministers such as Kinwun Mingyi, Taingda Mingyi, and Hlethin Atwinwun bore primary responsibility for ordering the massacre.[^24] Many historians accused Queen Supayalat of orchestrating the killings, but she denied the allegation in a 1924 interview with the Bandoola Journal, stating: "I was a teenager at the time and too young to undertake such an inhuman act. The massacre must have been organized by ministers and officials."[^25]

King Thibaw himself was deeply upset by the massacre and ordered the execution of the Latthonedaws (trusted royal bodyguards) and executioners responsible for the killings, though Queen Supayalat and her mother pleaded for their lives to be spared.[^26] The British government sent a formal letter of protest describing the killings as "shocking and horrible," urging that surviving members of the royal family be spared, and warning that if executions continued, the British flag would be taken down and the embassy in Mandalay withdrawn.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Despite the violent beginning of his reign and its brief duration, King Thibaw's government made genuine attempts at modernization and reform. Contrary to colonial narratives that portrayed him as an ineffective tyrant, his administration was at first highly reformist, led by capable ministers such as the Kinwun Mingyi and the Yaw Atwinwun, as well as several officials who had returned from studies in Europe.[^28]

King Thibaw's government was eager to modernize, reach out to the West, and preserve Burma's independence.[^29] His administration created a new administrative unit based on the British Indian system, dividing the kingdom into 10 districts in an attempt to improve governance and revenue collection.[^30] These reform efforts represented a continuation and expansion of the modernization initiatives begun under his father, King Mindon, who had established state-owned factories to produce modern weaponry and goods.[^31]

One of the most significant diplomatic initiatives of Thibaw's reign was his attempt to counterbalance British power by cultivating relations with France. In May 1883, a high-level Burmese delegation left for Europe, officially to gather industrial knowledge, but soon made its way to Paris where it began negotiations with French Foreign Minister Jules Ferry.[^32] This mission stayed in France for almost two years.[^33]

The delegation negotiated a supplement to the 1873 Franco-Burmese commercial treaty, which was signed in Paris.[^34] In 1885, a commercial treaty was concluded, and a French representative arrived in Mandalay.[^35] Ferry admitted to the British ambassador that the Burmese were attempting to negotiate a political alliance along with a purchase of military equipment.[^36] Though France refused in 1884 to sign a treaty promising military support against third-party attacks, they suggested the possibility of arms shipments from Tonkin.[^37]

This French connection alarmed the British, who saw it as a direct threat to their regional dominance. Rumors circulated that Thibaw's government had granted the French economic concessions in exchange for a political alliance, and British officials in Rangoon, Calcutta, and London began demanding immediate annexation of Upper Burma.[^38]

King Thibaw also demonstrated his commitment to Buddhist traditions and cultural patronage. As a devout Buddhist who had studied Pali texts and passed rigorous religious examinations, he sponsored local festivals, particularly during Diwali, even during his years in exile.[^39] His reign maintained the traditional relationship between the Burmese monarchy and the sangha (Buddhist monkhood), which had been a cornerstone of Burmese society for centuries.

## Controversies and Criticisms

King Thibaw's reign was plagued by controversies that severely damaged his legitimacy both domestically and internationally. The 1879 palace massacre cast a dark shadow over his rule from its inception, creating an image of brutality that British colonial propaganda would later exploit extensively.[^40] Whether or not Thibaw personally ordered the killings, his inability to prevent them or hold the true perpetrators accountable demonstrated weakness in controlling the powerful factions at court.

The kingdom was politically unstable under Thibaw's rule.[^41] Many hereditary chiefs took advantage of the political turmoil during his reign and paid less and less into the royal coffers.[^42] The writ of court mandarins no longer extended far beyond the city walls of Mandalay, and their position had already been weak.[^43] This internal fragmentation undermined the kingdom's ability to present a united front against external threats.

From 1883-85, the reformists around the king, led by the Kinwun Mingyi, the Yaw Atwinwun, and the Wetmasut Wundauk, were unable to implement the sweeping changes they felt necessary to save the kingdom.[^44] Conservatives, supported by factions within the army and the royal establishment, pushed back and halted many of the constitutional and fiscal reforms originally set in motion.[^45] This internal opposition revealed Thibaw's limited political power and his inability to overcome entrenched interests even when survival of the kingdom was at stake.

British colonial propaganda portrayed Queen Supayalat as a decadent tyrant who dominated her husband and opposed all change, while depicting Thibaw as a drunkard—though as a Buddhist monarch, he was more likely a teetotaler.[^46] The British claimed that King Thibaw was a tyrant intending to side with the French, that he had lost control of the country (thus allowing disorder at the frontiers), and that he was reneging on a treaty signed by his father.[^47] One British official intended to publish stories about Thibaw's wickedness that, he thought, "would make every old woman in London weep."[^48]

The immediate trigger for the Third Anglo-Burmese War was a dispute with the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation. The company was fined by Thibaw's government in October 1885 for under-reporting its extractions of teak from Toungoo and not paying its employees.[^49] The fine amounts reported vary from different sources, ranging from £2.3 million to around 500,000 rupees to 9.4 million rupees.[^50] The British demanded that the Burmese government accept a British-appointed arbitrator to settle the dispute, and when the Burmese refused, the British issued an ultimatum on October 22, 1885.[^51]

The ultimatum demanded that Burma accept a new British resident in Mandalay, suspend any legal action or fines against the company until the resident's arrival, submit to British control of foreign relations, and provide commercial facilities for developing trade between northern Burma and China.[^52] King Thibaw rejected these counter-demands, viewing them as an unacceptable infringement on Burmese sovereignty.[^53] As historian Blackburn notes: "And so the might of the British army was directed against a weak sovereign state, not to save British lives but to protect British profits."[^54]

---

## Personal Life

King Thibaw's personal life was dominated by his complex relationship with Queen Supayalat, his half-sister and principal wife. Their relationship began as a genuine love match rather than a purely political arrangement, with Thibaw declaring his love for Supayalat instead of accepting the arranged marriage to her elder sister that had been planned for him.[^55] However, the nature of their relationship and the balance of power between them would become a subject of intense scrutiny and controversy.

Queen Supayalat wielded substantial political authority during Thibaw's reign from 1878 to 1885.[^56] As king, he was strongly influenced by his wife and her mother, Hsinbyumashin.[^57] Supayalat held the power to appoint officials and make decisions on behalf of the king and had great influence over the court and the people.[^58] Her power was so formidable that when Supayalat "lifted her finger," the entire city shuddered, according to Lord Dufferin, the British Viceroy.[^59]

The stereotype of Supayalat as a conniving queen emerges largely as a remnant of colonial smear campaigns to discredit the Burmese monarchy in the lead-up to the British conquest of Upper Burma in 1885.[^60] Contemporary British press painted the Queen as a scheming "shrew" who controlled her husband.[^61] However, the true dynamics of their relationship were likely more nuanced than colonial caricatures suggested.

Thibaw and Supayalat had four daughters together: Myat Phaya Gyi (the eldest), Myat Phaya Lat (the second daughter), Myat Phaya (born March 7, 1886, in Madras during their journey to exile), and Myat Phaya Galay (the youngest).[^62] The birth of their third daughter during the traumatic journey into exile underscored the family's dramatic fall from power.

When British forces captured Mandalay in November 1885, Supayalat urged Thibaw to fight, saying that even if defeat was certain, at least there was honor in losing a war rather than surrendering without resistance.[^63] This statement reveals her fierce spirit and unwillingness to submit to foreign domination, even in the face of overwhelming odds.

The royal family was exiled to Ratnagiri, India, arriving in April 1886.[^64] During their first 24 years in India, Thibaw's family lived at Outram Hall in Dharangaon, inland from Ratnagiri, but in 1906 the British government agreed to spend over 125,000 rupees to construct a new official residence for them.[^65] Thibaw was reported to be reclusive and did not leave the property during his time in Ratnagiri.[^66] He described the place to his palace as "a very unpleasant place to live in" full of "snakes and scorpions."[^67]

The king had a hard life in Ratnagiri after leaving the grandeur of Mandalay's royal palace, living near a plague and leper colony.[^68] The royal family was in reduced circumstances and the king had to sell his jewels to make ends meet.[^69] In exile, the king's firstborn daughter, Myat Phaya Gyi, had a romance with a married Indian gatekeeper, Gopal Sawant, which resulted in a daughter, Tutu.[^70] Despite family disagreement, Myat Phaya Gyi and Tutu returned to Ratnagiri and lived there for the rest of their lives in poverty, with Tutu eventually having eleven children.[^71]

## Legacy

King Thibaw's legacy is complex and contested, viewed dramatically differently by various groups and changing interpretations over time. He died at age 57 on December 15, 1916, in Ratnagiri after spending 31 years in exile.[^72] He died of a heart attack, never having been allowed to return to his homeland.[^73] The British authorities rejected Queen Supayalat's request for a Buddhist burial for the late king, and the colonial government refused to allow his body to be returned home for fear that it might lead to calls for independence.[^74]

King Thibaw was buried in a small walled plot adjacent to a Christian cemetery in Ratnagiri, denied even in death the Buddhist funeral rites he deserved as a devout Buddhist monarch.[^75] The queen did not attend the funeral, although she sent two of the royal princesses to the ceremony.[^76] The surviving exiled royal family was relocated to Burma in 1919, after the king's death.[^77] It would not be until December 2012 that a Burmese head of government—President Thein Sein—would pay homage at the tomb of the king in Ratnagiri and meet the late monarch's descendants.[^78]

The memory of King Thibaw and the Burmese monarchy served as a potent symbol of national pride and the struggle for independence as resistance to colonial rule grew.[^79] General Aung San, the father of Myanmar's independence, reportedly went so far as saying that the restoration of the monarchy was integral to "the meaning of independence."[^80] A committee backed by U Nu, the first prime minister, planned to return Thibaw's remains to Burma.[^81]

During independence celebrations in 1948, people still recalled the day in 1885 when Burma's last king sailed into exile and the British took over.[^82] This demonstrates how King Thibaw's exile remained a touchstone for understanding Myanmar's colonial experience and loss of sovereignty. The demise of the monarchy and the monkhood—the twin pillars of Burmese society—was perhaps the most devastating aspect of the colonial period.[^83]

The British decisions to eliminate the monarchy (sending Thibaw into exile) and to detach the government from religious affairs deprived the sangha of its traditional status and official patronage.[^84] Colonialism left the nation divided and destroyed, with the British deploying their notorious divide-and-rule strategy.[^85] The colonial period fundamentally transformed Burmese society, economy, and political structure, leaving lasting impacts that continue to shape Myanmar today.

Despite the many generations that have passed since a Burmese king last sat on the Lion Throne, the monarchy still has the potential to ignite passions, described as "something that is still smoldering—and it can burst into flames any time."[^86] The myth of King Thibaw continues to inspire the people of Myanmar, serving as a basis for unity, stability, and progress.[^87] It's not King Thibaw personally but the bygone era of Konbaung rule that is remembered by some with nostalgia, with the perception being that the country was robbed of the institution of monarchy by the British with colonization.[^88]

The royal regalia of Burma, removed as spoils of war, were displayed in the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A Museum, London).[^89] In 1964, the British government returned more than 140 pieces of royal jewelry and other items from among the many valuables that British colonizers looted from the Mandalay Palace following their annexation of Upper Burma in 1885.[^90] This return of stolen treasures represented a symbolic acknowledgment of past injustices, though it came far too late for Thibaw himself.

King Thibaw's impoverished descendants continue to live in both Myanmar and India today.[^91] His granddaughter, Hteik Su Phaya Gyi, born in the 1920s, lived to age 97 in Yangon and Pyin Oo Lwin.[^92] The youngest daughter, Myat Phaya Galay, known as the "Rebel Princess," boldly demanded in the early 1930s the return of her father's kingdom and the royal jewels seized during the annexation.[^93]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarly reassessment of King Thibaw has challenged colonial-era characterizations and revealed a more sympathetic portrait of Burma's last king. Sudha Shah's meticulously researched 2016 book "The King In Exile" captures Thibaw's life with great empathy, representing a historiographical turn toward understanding this last Burmese monarch in his full human complexity rather than as a colonial caricature.[^94]

Revisionist historians emphasize that King Thibaw's government was highly reformist at first, led by capable men such as the Kinwun Mingyi and the Yaw Atwinwun, as well as several officials who had returned from studies in Europe.[^95] These scholars argue that attempts by Mandalay in the period 1853–85 to modernize administration have been dismissed as well-meaning but insignificant, when in fact they represented serious efforts at state-building and reform.[^96]

Historians note that Thibaw created a new administrative unit based on British India's system, dividing the kingdom into 10 districts—a significant administrative reform that demonstrated engagement with modern governance structures.[^97] His government was eager to modernize, reach out to the West, and preserve Burma's independence, even if these ambitious plans were ultimately foiled by conservative opposition within the palace and army.[^98]

Some scholars emphasize that there was a slanderous English rumor that Thibaw was a drunkard, when it is more likely that, as a Buddhist monarch who had passed rigorous religious examinations, he was a teetotaler.[^99] Contemporary historians increasingly view him as "a goodhearted, even-tempered young man" who was genuinely devoted to Buddhist principles and scholarship rather than the despotic tyrant of British propaganda.[^100]

Defenders of Thibaw point out that he "probably undeservedly" became notorious for the 1879 massacre, which was likely arranged by Queen Supayalat's mother and powerful ministers rather than the king himself.[^101] His deep upset at the massacre and his order to execute those responsible (later commuted due to pleading from Supayalat and her mother) suggests he was not the bloodthirsty tyrant portrayed in colonial narratives.[^102]

Historical revisionism has revealed that British characterizations of King Thibaw as a despotic tyrant were part of a propaganda campaign to justify annexation of Burma for economic and geopolitical reasons.[^103] As one British official cynically noted, he intended to publish stories about Thibaw's wickedness that "would make every old woman in London weep"—revealing the deliberate nature of the propaganda effort.[^104] Scholar Blackburn writes: "And so the might of the British army was directed against a weak sovereign state, not to save British lives but to protect British profits."[^105]

### Negative Views

Critics of King Thibaw point to significant weaknesses in his rule that contributed to Burma's fall to British imperialism. Historians describe Thibaw as a weak ruler who fell under the influence of his secondary queen Supayalat and her mother, resulting in a regime marked by palace intrigue rather than effective governance.[^106] Contemporary historians viewed him as "a puppet to be manipulated" by those around him—a characterization that, while perhaps exaggerated by colonial sources, contained elements of truth about his limited political power.[^107]

The kingdom was demonstrably politically unstable under Thibaw's rule.[^108] Many hereditary chiefs took advantage of the political turmoil during his reign and paid less and less into the royal coffers, severely undermining state finances and central authority.[^109] The writ of court mandarins no longer extended far beyond the city walls of Mandalay, revealing the hollowing out of royal power even before the British invasion.[^110]

Critical scholars note that from 1883-85, the reformists around the king were unable to implement the sweeping changes they felt necessary to save the kingdom, being blocked by conservatives supported by factions within the army and royal establishment.[^111] This failure to overcome internal opposition even when the kingdom's survival was at stake revealed fundamental weaknesses in Thibaw's leadership and political acumen. The reformist programs of his reign "are never placed in a broader historical context" because they ultimately failed to achieve meaningful transformation.[^112]

The 1879 palace massacre, regardless of who specifically ordered it, occurred under Thibaw's rule and with his acquiescence (at least initially).[^113] The massacre of 40 to 80 royal family members to secure his throne—whether ordered by him, his wife, his mother-in-law, or ministers—represented a catastrophic moral failure and delegitimized his rule in the eyes of both domestic and international observers.[^114] His inability to prevent the massacre or ensure swift justice for the victims demonstrated either complicity or weakness, neither of which inspired confidence in his leadership.

British officials and contemporary observers consistently characterized Thibaw as a feeble and despotic king.[^115] While modern historians recognize this as partly propaganda, the characterization gained traction because Thibaw's actual governance provided supporting evidence—political instability, loss of territorial control, failed reforms, and dependence on court factions. The British justification for war—that Thibaw was a tyrant who had lost control of the country, was conspiring with the French, and was reneging on treaties—contained exaggerations but was not entirely fabricated.[^116]

Critics also point to Thibaw's diplomatic failures. His attempt to play France against Britain backfired spectacularly, providing the British with a casus belli without securing any meaningful French military support.[^117] His rejection of the British ultimatum in 1885, while perhaps principled, was also strategically naive given Burma's complete military inferiority to the British Empire. Queen Supayalat urged him to fight even if defeat was certain, prioritizing honor over pragmatic survival—a romantic but ultimately disastrous approach that ensured Burma's complete annexation rather than a negotiated settlement that might have preserved some autonomy.[^118]
