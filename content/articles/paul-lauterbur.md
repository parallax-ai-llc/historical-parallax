## Summary

Paul Lauterbur developed the technique of using magnetic field gradients to create two-dimensional NMR images, which became the basis for MRI. His 1973 paper in Nature showed how spatially localized NMR signals could produce images of objects, including living organisms. He shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
