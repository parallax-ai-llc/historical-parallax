## Summary

Wu Jianxiong (Chien-Shiung Wu) was a Chinese-American experimental physicist who conducted the Wu experiment in 1957, which proved that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. Known as the 'First Lady of Physics,' she was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Princeton. Despite her Nobel-caliber work, she was controversially not included in the Nobel Prize.
