## Summary

J. Craig Venter led the private effort to sequence the human genome, competing with the publicly funded Human Genome Project and reaching a tie in 2000. He later created the first synthetic bacterial genome and the first organism with a fully synthetic genome (Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0) in 2010, opening the era of synthetic biology.
