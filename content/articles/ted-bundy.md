## Summary
Theodore Robert Bundy was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped, and murdered numerous young women during the 1970s. He confessed to 30 murders before his execution, though the actual number of victims may be higher. Bundy was known for his charismatic personality, which he used to lure victims. He is one of the most infamous serial killers in American history.

## Early Life
Ted Bundy was born on November 24, 1946, in Burlington, Vermont, to Eleanor Louise Cowell. He was raised believing his grandparents were his parents and his mother was his sister. Bundy grew up in Tacoma, Washington, where he was described as a bright but socially awkward youth. He attended the University of Puget Sound and later the University of Washington, where he studied psychology. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Bundy began his killing spree in 1974, targeting young women in Washington and Oregon. He would often feign injury or impersonate authority figures to gain victims' trust. His crimes spread across multiple states including Utah, Colorado, and Florida. He was known for revisiting crime scenes and engaging in necrophilia. His victims were typically young women with dark hair parted in the middle. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Bundy was first arrested in Utah in 1975 for aggravated kidnapping. He escaped custody twice — once from a courthouse in Aspen, Colorado in 1977, and again from jail in Glenwood Springs. After his second escape, he fled to Florida where he committed further murders at the Chi Omega sorority house at Florida State University. He was captured in Pensacola in February 1978 and convicted of murder. He was executed by electric chair at Florida State Prison on January 24, 1989. [^3]
