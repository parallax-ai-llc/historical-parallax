## Summary

Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072) was a Chinese poet, historian, and statesman of the Song dynasty who reintroduced the simple "ancient style" in Chinese literature and sought to reform Chinese political life through principles of classical Confucianism.[^1] He is considered the central figure of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song and is credited with reviving the Classical Prose Movement.[^2] As a historian, he led the compilation of the New Book of Tang and wrote the Historical Records of the Five Dynasties, the only book in the Twenty-Four Histories written privately by a single author.[^3] His influence extended beyond his lifetime, as he trained and promoted brilliant young writers including Su Shi, Su Zhe, and Zeng Gong, shaping Chinese literature for nearly a millennium.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ouyang Xiu was born in 1007 in Mianyang, Sichuan province, where his father served as a judge.[^5] His family originated from Jishui (then known as Luling) in Jiangxi province, though they were of relatively humble background, not descended from one of the old great lineages of Chinese society.[^6] Tragedy struck early when his father died when Ouyang was only three years old, fundamentally shaping his childhood.[^7] His literate mother was responsible for much of his early education and took him to live in his paternal uncle's house in Suizhou, Hubei, where they lived in rural poverty.[^8]

Unable to afford traditional tutoring due to their impoverished circumstances, Ouyang was largely self-taught, a remarkable testament to both his intellectual abilities and his mother's dedication to his education.[^9] Despite these financial hardships, his mother ensured he received instruction in classical texts and Confucian principles.[^10] This early experience of poverty and loss would later influence his political sympathies and his literary themes, particularly his concern for ordinary people and his critique of aristocratic privilege.[^11]

The young Ouyang demonstrated exceptional literary talent from an early age. He immersed himself in classical texts and was particularly impressed by the works of Han Yu, the great master of Tang-dynasty literature, whose pure and easy "ancient style," free of outworn metaphors and allusions, would become a major influence on his own writing.[^12] He married the daughter of a local but rich and well-connected family, though his first wife died, probably during childbirth; his second wife also died, and he remarried a third and final wife.[^13] At age 22, in 1030, Ouyang passed the jinshi degree examination on his third attempt, placing first in the doctoral examinations—a remarkable achievement that launched his official career.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Following his success in the imperial examinations in 1030, Ouyang Xiu was appointed a judge at the western capital, Luoyang, beginning his career in government service.[^15] In 1034, a pivotal moment in his career occurred when he was appointed collator of texts at the Imperial Academy in Kaifeng, where he became associated with Fan Zhongyan, the prefect of Kaifeng.[^16] This relationship would prove crucial to his political development and would define much of his career trajectory.

When Fan Zhongyan was demoted after criticizing the Chief Councillor and submitting reform proposals, Ouyang courageously defended him, an action that brought him both demotion and recognition among reform-minded officials.[^17] This principled stand demonstrated the Confucian values that would characterize Ouyang's entire career—loyalty to mentors, commitment to reform, and willingness to sacrifice personal advancement for political principles.[^18]

During the 1040s, Ouyang Xiu emerged as one of the major proponents of the Qingli Reforms, a comprehensive reform program led by Fan Zhongyan, Fu Bi, and Han Qi from 1043 to 1045.[^19] The reforms included a ten-point platform that addressed improved entrance examinations for government service, elimination of favoritism in government appointments, increased salaries for officials, strengthened agricultural production, land reclamation, and enhanced administrative efficiency.[^20] However, when lead reformer Fan Zhongyan fell from power in 1045, Ouyang was also demoted to posts away from the capital.[^21]

During this period of exile from central government, Ouyang was accused and tried for having had illicit relations with his niece many years before, though he was acquitted.[^22] It was during one such demotion to Chuzhou that he built the famous Zuiweng Pavilion (Old Drunkard's Pavilion) and wrote the celebrated essay about it that would become one of the most famous works in Chinese literature.[^23] He returned to the central government only in 1054 and gradually moved up the bureaucratic ladder again.[^24] By 1060, he was made assistant councilor of the state, and in the early 1060s, he was one of the most powerful men in court, holding the positions of Hanlin Academician, Vice Commissioner of Military Affairs, Vice Minister of Revenues, and Assistant Chief Councilor concurrently.[^25]

## Major Achievements

### Literary Innovations and the Classical Prose Movement

Ouyang Xiu's greatest achievement was his revival and promotion of the Classical Prose Movement (guwen), establishing a literary revolution that would dominate Chinese writing for centuries.[^26] Like Han Yu before him, Ouyang advocated a simpler, more direct prose to replace the mannered and excessively rhythmic pianwen ("parallel prose") style then popular, and his writings in the resultant guwen style established a model emulated thenceforth.[^27] The movement promoted writing that was direct, expressive, rooted in classical texts, while also incorporating elements of colloquial language for accessibility.[^28]

His writing was likened to a meandering stream: fluid, ample, and intricate in form, yet clear in logic and easy in tone.[^29] Even at its most intense, Ouyang's prose remained unforced and graceful, exemplifying the three key functions of prose—argument, narration, and lyricism—which were masterfully blended and perfected by Song dynasty prose writers led by Ouyang.[^30] His innovative style contained elements learned from his prose writing, including his use of self-caricature and exaggeration, and his poetry bears the characteristic of literary playfulness common to Northern Song poetry.[^31]

### Historical Scholarship

As a historian, Ouyang Xiu was put in charge by Emperor Renzong of creating the New Book of Tang, which was completed in 1060 after 17 years of work.[^32] The work was compiled by a team of Song dynasty scholars, led by Ouyang and Song Qi, covering the Tang dynasty in ten volumes and 225 chapters.[^33] Ouyang frequently invoked the principle of reason in evaluating historical accounts and purged all accounts containing elements of myth or superstition, thereby dramatically shortening many biographies of emperors and major figures.[^34]

The New Book of Tang included several innovative sections, such as a much-expanded series of treatises on topics including the horse trade with Tibet and military affairs, and a table of the bureaucratic hierarchy of Tang administration that was missing from the Old Book of Tang.[^35] It was the first of the standard histories to include a treatise on selecting and appointing officials.[^36] Ouyang also wrote in his spare time the Historical Records of the Five Dynasties (Wudai Shiji), spending more than 20 years on its compilation—the only book in the Twenty-Four Histories to have been written in private by a single author.[^37]

### Founding of Chinese Epigraphy

Zhu Xi (1130-1200) named Ouyang Xiu the first to collect and record "inscriptions on metal and stone" (jinshi), and he is considered the founder of Chinese epigraphy.[^38] His collection titled 'Collected Records of the Past' (Jigu lu) comprised approximately 1,000 items organized by acquisition dates, including over 1,000 rubbings of stone inscriptions.[^39] Unwilling to leave inscriptions to the elements or to entrust them to faulty human copyists, he decided to make rubbings, playing an important role in establishing the use of epigraphy as a historiographic technique.[^40]

### Poetry and Literary Works

Ouyang wrote both shi and ci poetry. His poems are generally relaxed, humorous, and often self-deprecatory; he gave himself the title "The Old Drunkard" (Zuiweng).[^41] He is best known for his ci, which he was instrumental in raising to the level of being an important and widespread Song poetic style.[^42] His series of ten poems entitled "West Lake is Good," set to the tune "Picking Mulberries," helped to popularize the genre as a vehicle for serious poetry.[^43] His poetry dealt with new themes that previous poets had avoided, including interactions with friends, family life, food and beverages, antiques, and political themes.[^44]

His most celebrated prose work, "Zuiwengting ji" ("Old Drunkard Pavilion"), is lyrical in quality and acclaimed as one of the highest achievements of Chinese travel writing.[^45] The essay's most well-known line, "The Old Toper cares not for the wine, his interest lies in the landscape," remains an idiom in modern Chinese to describe someone with an ulterior motive.[^46] In 1059, he wrote "The Sounds of Autumn," a fu (rhapsodic prose poem) considered one of the most beautiful pieces in Chinese literature.[^47]

### Mentorship and Educational Reform

In 1057, Ouyang Xiu was placed in charge of civil service examinations and shifted the selection criteria in favor of candidates who excelled in classical style prose writing.[^48] That year, Zeng Gong, Su Shi, and Su Zhe passed the imperial examination under his supervision.[^49] He offered his patronage and endorsement to the "Three Su" (Su Xun and his sons Su Shi and Su Zhe), magnifying their reputation in the literary circle.[^50] Ouyang became the backbone of keeping the Ancient Style Prose Movement alive in the Song period by training and promoting numerous talented young writers, earning recognition as the leading man of letters in the Northern Song.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Political Scandals

Ouyang Xiu's career was marred by several damaging scandals, some fabricated by political enemies. In 1045, he was targeted through a fabricated scandal, accused of improper relations with his niece via a subordinate's involvement—a charge lacking evidence but amplified by political rivals through rumors and satirical songs, leading to his exile from the capital.[^52] Around 1067, during the ascension of Emperor Shenzong, Ouyang was charged with several crimes, including having sexual relations with his daughter-in-law.[^53] While the charges had no credibility, the investigation alone damaged his reputation irreparably.[^54] His enemies knew that even baseless accusations, if investigated, could harm a scholar-official's standing in Confucian society, which prized moral rectitude above all else.

### Opposition to Wang Anshi's Reforms

Politically, Ouyang was an early patron of the political reformer Wang Anshi but later became one of his strongest opponents.[^55] While a magistrate in Shandong, he opposed and refused to carry out reforms advocated by Wang Anshi, particularly a system of low-interest loans to farmers.[^56] In 1069, when his former protégé Wang Anshi undertook a program of radical reforms known as the New Policies, Ouyang criticized the program as ill-advised and repeatedly requested permission to resign.[^57] He retired from politics in 1071, after vehemently and unsuccessfully opposing Wang Anshi's New Policies, whose career he had very much helped earlier.[^58]

### Reputation as a Libertine

Revered as one of the greatest Confucian scholars of the Northern Song dynasty, Ouyang Xiu also went down in history for his reputation as a libertine and his involvement in a series of sexual scandals, creating a persistent contradiction between the public orthodoxy of the great statesman and the heterodoxy of his private experiences.[^59] Modern scholars acknowledge that alongside his image as a venerable Confucian, an alternative narrative of Ouyang Xiu exists as a dissolute libertine, fond of wine, song lyrics (ci), and courtesans.[^60]

### Historical Methodology Criticisms

As a historian, Ouyang has been criticized as overly didactic in his approach.[^61] His insistence on purging accounts containing elements of myth or superstition, while promoting rational historiography, also meant that he sometimes removed culturally significant material that provided insight into Tang dynasty beliefs and practices.[^62] Critics have argued that his moral judgments sometimes overshadowed historical accuracy, reflecting the tension in Confucian historiography between recording events faithfully and using history for moral instruction.[^63]

---

## Personal Life

Ouyang Xiu married the daughter of a local but rich and well-connected family, though his personal life was marked by tragedy and loss.[^64] His first wife died, probably during childbirth; his second wife also died, and he remarried a third and final wife.[^65] These personal losses deeply affected him and are reflected in some of his more melancholic poetry.[^66]

He called himself Zuiweng ("Old Drunkard") and later Liu Yi Jushi ("居士of Six Ones"), reflecting his self-deprecating humor and his love of wine, which featured prominently in his poetry and essays.[^67] His personality was characterized by an optimistic and lighthearted attitude coupled with intense self-cultivation, making him a model scholar, political figure, and Confucian gentleman for generations of Chinese.[^68]

His final years were spent planning retirement to beautiful Anhui, the place of his Old Drunkard Pavilion, though he was finally permitted to retire in 1071 with the title of grand preceptor of the crown prince—five years before the standard retirement age.[^69] However, he died within months of his retirement on September 22, 1072, in present-day Fuyang, Anhui, of unknown causes.[^70] He was posthumously honored with the title Wenzhong ("literary and loyal").[^71]

---

## Legacy

Ouyang Xiu's legacy endures as he is celebrated as a model scholar and an influential figure in Chinese literature and history, with his writings remaining valued and studied across generations.[^72] A political figure and innovative writer of prose and poetry, Ouyang substantially shaped the Confucian tradition that dominated China for almost a thousand years.[^73] Because of the breadth of his abilities and his optimistic and lighthearted attitude, coupled with intense self-cultivation, it was Ouyang who became a model scholar, political figure, and Confucian gentleman for generations of Chinese.[^74]

His most enduring impact was on Chinese prose style. The guwen movement he championed became the dominant prose style in China until the late Qing dynasty, influencing centuries of scholars and officials.[^75] Song prose, under his leadership, became more concise, natural, and accessible to common readers.[^76] It was the late Ming scholar Mao Kun who coined the name "Eight Masters of the Tang and Song" in a compilation he curated, titled "Selected Works of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song," and the subsequent popularity of this book solidified their status as masters of Chinese prose.[^77]

His influence on later generations of writers was profound. Through his patronage and his role in imperial examinations, he ensured that the Classical Prose Movement would continue through disciples like Su Shi, Su Zhe, and Zeng Gong, who themselves became literary giants.[^78] Even his political opponent Wang Anshi wrote moving tributes on his behalf, referring to him as the greatest literary figure of his age.[^79]

The Zuiweng Pavilion in Chuzhou remains a world-renowned ancient landmark, standing at the foot of Langya Mountain in Chuzhou City, Anhui Province, and is known as one of the "Four Famous Pavilions of China."[^80] His historical works, particularly the New Book of Tang, remain important sources for understanding Tang dynasty history, and his pioneering work in epigraphy established methodologies that scholars continue to use today.[^81]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars and historians celebrate Ouyang Xiu as one of the founders of the ci tradition and acknowledge his central role in shaping Song dynasty literature.[^82] He is regarded as one of the great masters of prose of the Tang and Song era, with his writings establishing models that influenced Chinese literature for nearly a millennium.[^83] His promotion of reason and rejection of superstition in the New Tang History marked a significant departure from earlier historical works, establishing more rigorous historiographical standards.[^84]

Scholars particularly praise his role as a mentor and patron. His willingness to recognize and promote young talent, regardless of factional politics, demonstrated a commitment to literary excellence over personal advantage.[^85] His revision of examination criteria to favor classical prose writing fundamentally changed the nature of Chinese civil service examinations and helped ensure that literary merit, rather than mere technical skill, became a key criterion for advancement.[^86]

His work in epigraphy is recognized as pioneering, establishing methods for collecting, cataloging, and analyzing ancient inscriptions that advanced Song-era studies of ancient artifacts and bronze vessels.[^87] The combination of his literary, historical, and scholarly achievements makes him one of the most multifaceted intellectuals of the Song dynasty.[^88] Contemporary assessments note that his contributions to Confucian aesthetics, through both his theoretical writings and his practice of calligraphy and epigraphy, helped define Song dynasty cultural values.[^89]

### Negative Views

Despite his towering reputation, Ouyang Xiu has faced significant criticism from both contemporaries and later scholars. As a historian, he has been criticized as overly didactic, allowing moral judgments to override historical accuracy.[^90] His insistence on removing all supernatural and mythological elements from historical accounts, while promoting rationalism, also meant losing valuable cultural and religious information about the Tang period.[^91]

His political career was marked by inconsistency and pragmatic compromises that disappointed some followers. After championing the Qingli Reforms in the 1040s, he later opposed Wang Anshi's more radical reforms in the 1060s, leading to accusations of conservative timidity.[^92] Some critics argued that his opposition to Wang Anshi stemmed more from personal and factional rivalries than from principled policy disagreements.[^93]

The sexual scandals that dogged his career, whether true or fabricated, created a persistent shadow over his reputation as a Confucian moral exemplar.[^94] The contradiction between his public advocacy of Confucian orthodoxy and his reputation for involvement with courtesans and wine led some to question his sincerity.[^95] Later Confucian moralists found his behavior problematic and struggled to reconcile his literary genius with his apparent personal failings.[^96]

Some literary critics have argued that while his prose was influential, it lacked the emotional depth and stylistic brilliance of his disciple Su Shi.[^97] His poetry, though innovative in addressing new themes, was sometimes criticized as too prosaic and lacking the refinement of earlier Tang masters.[^98] Modern scholars note that his influence, while vast, may have also stifled more experimental literary approaches by establishing the guwen style as orthodox.[^99]
