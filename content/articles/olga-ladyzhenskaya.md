## Summary

Olga Ladyzhenskaya made groundbreaking contributions to partial differential equations and fluid dynamics. She proved fundamental existence and uniqueness results for the Navier-Stokes equations (in 2D) and developed the theory of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. Her father was executed during Stalin's purges, but she persevered to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.
