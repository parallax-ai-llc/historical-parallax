## Summary

Jenny Saville is a British painter known for her monumental paintings of the human body, particularly female flesh. Her large-scale nudes challenge conventional beauty standards with their unflinching depiction of scale, weight, and physicality. She became the most expensive living female artist when Propped sold for $12.4 million.
