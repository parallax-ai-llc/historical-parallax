## Summary

Fela Kuti was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, and activist who created Afrobeat, a fusion of West African music, jazz, funk, and political commentary. His sprawling compositions with his band Africa 70 became vehicles for fierce criticism of Nigerian military governments. Despite repeated arrests and beatings, he remained defiant until his death.
