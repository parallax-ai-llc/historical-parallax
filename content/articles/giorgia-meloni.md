## Summary

Giorgia Meloni is an Italian politician who became Italy's first female Prime Minister on October 22, 2022, leading the most right-wing Italian government since World War II.[^1] Born in Rome in 1977, she rose from a working-class background to become the leader of the Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d'Italia) party, which has direct institutional links to Italy's post-fascist political movement.[^2] Her political journey began at age 15 when she joined the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement, a neo-fascist party founded by supporters of Benito Mussolini.[^3] Despite concerns about her party's fascist roots, Meloni has pursued a pragmatic governing approach, maintaining strong relations with NATO, the European Union, and supporting Ukraine against Russian invasion, while domestically promoting traditional values, strict immigration controls, and national sovereignty.[^4][^5] She is recognized as one of the most powerful women in the world, with Forbes ranking her fourth and Politico naming her the most powerful person in Europe in 2025.[^6]

## Early Life and Background

Giorgia Meloni was born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy, in the working-class neighborhood of Garbatella in central Rome.[^7] Her early life was marked by economic hardship and family instability. Her father, a tax advisor, abandoned the family in 1978 when Meloni was only one year old, moving to the Canary Islands and leaving her mother, Anna Paratore, to raise two daughters alone.[^8][^9] Anna Paratore, who hailed from Sicily, later became a novelist and worked to support her family in challenging circumstances.[^10]

Growing up in Garbatella, a historically working-class district of Rome, shaped Meloni's political worldview and her connection to ordinary Italians struggling with economic difficulties. Raised by a single mother, Meloni developed a close bond with her older sister Arianna, whom she described as "the most important person in my life" before the birth of her own daughter.[^11] This working-class upbringing and experience of paternal abandonment would later inform her political rhetoric about traditional family values and Italian identity.

Meloni's education began at the Istituto Tecnico Professionale di Stato Amerigo Vespucci in Rome, where she studied languages from 1990 to 1996, receiving a mark of 60/60 on her diploma di maturità linguistica.[^12] She demonstrated early academic promise and went on to pursue legal studies at the University of Rome La Sapienza, one of Italy's most prestigious universities. In 2000, she received a Laurea in Giurisprudenza (law degree), which would later complement her political career.[^13] Beyond her formal education, Meloni is also a professional journalist, a qualification that has helped her navigate Italy's media-saturated political landscape.[^14]

However, perhaps the most defining aspect of Meloni's formative years was her early political involvement. At the remarkably young age of 15, in 1992, Meloni joined the Youth Front (Fronte della Gioventù), the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano; MSI), a neo-fascist political party founded in 1946 by supporters of former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.[^15][^16] This early political engagement would prove controversial throughout her career, as the MSI was explicitly created to preserve the legacy of Italian fascism in the post-war era. Despite the party's controversial origins, the teenage Meloni found in it a political home and a sense of purpose that had been missing from her unstable family life.

## Rise to Power

Giorgia Meloni's ascent through Italian politics was meteoric, characterized by youth, ambition, and a consistent right-wing ideological commitment. After joining the MSI's youth wing in 1992, she quickly distinguished herself as a talented organizer and speaker. When the Italian Social Movement dissolved in 1995 and transformed into the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale; AN), a post-fascist party that sought to distance itself from Mussolini's legacy while maintaining right-wing positions, Meloni seamlessly transitioned with it.[^17] She became the national leader of Student Action (Azione Studentesca), the student movement of the National Alliance, demonstrating leadership capabilities that belied her young age.[^18]

Meloni's first electoral success came in 1998, at just 21 years old, when she was elected as a councillor to the provincial government of Rome.[^19] She held this position until 2002, gaining valuable experience in local governance and building a network of political contacts. Her performance in this role caught the attention of senior figures in Italy's center-right coalition, and in 2006, at age 29, she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian parliament.[^20]

The most significant breakthrough in Meloni's early career came in 2008 when Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi appointed her as Minister for Youth in his cabinet.[^21] At 31, she became the youngest minister in postwar Italian political history, a distinction that brought her national prominence and media attention. She held this portfolio until 2011, during which time she worked to promote youth employment initiatives and cultural programs, though her tenure was also marked by Italy's broader economic struggles during the global financial crisis.

Following the collapse of Berlusconi's government and the dissolution of the National Alliance, which had merged into Berlusconi's People of Freedom party, Meloni saw an opportunity to create a new political vehicle. On December 21, 2012, she founded Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), a party that would return to the nationalist, conservative roots of the Italian right while eschewing some of the baggage of Berlusconi's center-right coalition.[^22] In 2014, she was elected president of the party, a position she has held continuously since.[^23]

The Brothers of Italy initially struggled to gain traction, remaining a minor party in Italian politics while Berlusconi's coalition and the populist Five Star Movement dominated the political landscape. However, Meloni's patience and persistence proved strategic. She kept her party in opposition during the chaos of the 2018-2022 parliamentary term, which saw multiple governments rise and fall, allowing her to criticize the failings of others while building her own political brand.

The breakthrough came in the 2019 European Parliament elections, when Brothers of Italy won more than 6 percent of the vote, signaling growing support for Meloni's brand of nationalism.[^24] Her rising stature was recognized internationally when she was named president of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), a Euroskeptic bloc within the European Parliament, in 2020.[^25] This position gave her a platform to build relationships with other right-wing and conservative leaders across Europe.

By 2022, Meloni had positioned herself perfectly to capitalize on Italian voters' exhaustion with political instability and economic stagnation. Leading a right-wing coalition that included Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini's League, she campaigned on promises to impose a naval blockade on migrants in the Mediterranean, stand up to "globalists," and restore Italian sovereignty and traditional values.[^26] Her message resonated: in the September 2022 elections, Fratelli d'Italia won 26 percent of the vote, making it the largest party in parliament.[^27] On October 22, 2022, at age 45, Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy's first female prime minister, heading the most right-wing government Italy had seen since 1945.[^28]

## Major Achievements

Since taking office in October 2022, Giorgia Meloni has compiled a record of achievements that have surprised many international observers who expected a more radical or incompetent government. Her pragmatic approach to governance has produced both domestic stability and international respect, even as she maintains her nationalist rhetoric for domestic consumption.

### Government Stability and Longevity

Perhaps Meloni's most significant achievement has been simply staying in power. The Meloni government has become the seventh longest-serving government of the Italian Republic and the third-longest government of Italy's Second Republic, with more than 1,000 days in office as of late 2025.[^29] In a country notorious for political instability—Italy has had more than 60 governments since World War II—this represents a remarkable achievement. Her coalition has remained largely cohesive despite including fractious partners like Matteo Salvini's League and the remnants of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (until his death in 2023).

### Foreign Policy Pragmatism

From the outset of her mandate, Meloni abandoned the implementation of her sovereigntist campaign agenda on major international issues.[^30] On Ukraine, the European Union, and transatlantic relations, she has followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, the widely respected technocrat Mario Draghi, rather than pursuing the anti-EU, Russia-friendly policies that some feared.

**Ukraine Support**: Meloni has been a strong supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russian invasion. On February 22, 2023, she visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stressing that Ukraine could count on Italy's continued military, economic, and political support.[^31] This stance put her at odds with some of her domestic allies and European counterparts on the far right, but aligned Italy firmly with NATO and EU consensus.

**European Union Relations**: Despite her Euroskeptic campaign rhetoric, Meloni has maintained cordial relations with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and positioned herself as a reliable interlocutor within the EU.[^32] She has skillfully navigated EU politics, securing Italian interests while avoiding the confrontational approach that characterized the previous populist government. Her Minister of the Economy has pursued a rigorous fiscal policy that facilitated access to funds from the European Recovery Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza, PNRR), of which Italy is the main beneficiary, representing a loan of nearly €200 billion.[^33]

**NATO Commitment**: Meloni's government has been committed to strengthening Italy's role within NATO and has underscored the importance of the transatlantic relationship with the United States.[^34] She has consistently supported increased defense spending and Italy's contribution to NATO operations, reversing years of Italian reluctance to meet defense spending targets.

### International Recognition

Meloni's pragmatic governance has earned her significant international recognition. In 2025, Forbes ranked her as the fourth-most-powerful woman in the world, and Time magazine listed her among the most influential people globally.[^35] Most notably, Politico ranked her as the most powerful person in Europe in 2025, ahead of traditional powerbrokers like Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz.[^36] In September 2024, she received recognition from the Atlantic Council, giving a speech at their Global Citizen Awards ceremony, a sign of her acceptance in transatlantic security circles.[^37]

### Domestic Policy Implementation

On the domestic front, Meloni has pursued a conservative social agenda while maintaining economic pragmatism:

**Traditional Values**: She has championed a vision of Italy that prioritizes Italian traditions, the traditional family unit, law and order, and economic self-sufficiency.[^38] Her government has implemented policies supporting families with children and promoting Italian cultural heritage.

**Immigration Policy**: While Meloni's rhetoric on immigration remains tough—advocating for robust measures to curb illegal immigration and calling for greater national control over immigration policies—her practical approach has been more nuanced.[^39] She has challenged the EU's quota system and emphasized the defense of Italy's borders as a matter of national sovereignty. However, facing Italy's severe labor shortage, she has in practice authorized the granting of 500,000 work visas to non-European nationals, demonstrating a willingness to adapt ideology to economic reality.[^40]

**Economic Management**: The government has maintained fiscal discipline while accessing EU recovery funds, a balancing act that has kept financial markets calm and Italy's borrowing costs manageable. This represents a significant achievement for a country that has long struggled with high public debt and economic stagnation.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her governmental achievements, Giorgia Meloni remains a deeply controversial figure, both in Italy and internationally, with critics raising serious concerns about her political origins, her relationship with Italy's fascist past, and the implications of her policies for democracy and human rights.

### Fascist Origins and Historical Ambiguity

The most persistent controversy surrounding Meloni concerns her party's direct lineage to Italian fascism. She has been repeatedly criticized for "trying to distance her neofascist past from fascism itself" rather than genuinely repudiating fascist ideology.[^41] Meloni was a member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI) from 1992 to 1994, a party explicitly founded by former fascists to preserve Mussolini's legacy.[^42] She is the first Italian Prime Minister whose party could claim an institutional link to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party.[^43]

As a young activist in 1996, Meloni stated in a televised interview that she believed Benito Mussolini had been a "good politician," a comment that has haunted her throughout her career.[^44] While she now claims that those nostalgic for fascism "have no place" in Italian political life, critics argue that her repudiation is superficial and tactical rather than genuine.

### Party Symbolism and Youth Wing Scandal

Meloni has refused to remove the tricolor flame from her Brothers of Italy party logo, despite calls from within her own camp to dispense with fascist symbols.[^45] According to some analysts, the base of the logo represents Mussolini's tomb, a claim that underscores the party's continuing symbolic connection to the fascist past.[^46]

In a damaging scandal, an undercover media investigation released a video showing members of her party's youth wing making fascist salutes and chanting "Sieg Heil."[^47] Meloni responded by stating "There is no room in Brothers of Italy for racism or antisemitism," but the incident raised serious questions about the culture within her party organization and the sincerity of its claimed distance from fascism.[^48]

### Historical Revisionism Concerns

Academic researchers have documented concerning patterns of historical revisionism under Meloni's government. A controversy arose with the publication of the Italian army's 2024 calendar, which included tributes to soldiers who fought for Mussolini's regime, criticized as an attempt to rehabilitate fascism.[^49] Scholars have identified three categories of abuses of the fascist past by Meloni's government: historical reassessment, fake history, and evocation-cum-denial of fascist connections.[^50]

### Attacks on Press Freedom and Democratic Norms

Meloni has been criticized for using defamation lawsuits to silence critics, including journalists and academics. Most notoriously, she has gone after 82-year-old historian Luciano Canfora, who will face trial for describing Meloni as a "neo-Nazi in her soul."[^51] Press freedom organizations have expressed concern about this pattern of litigation against critical voices.

Her government is also pushing a constitutional reform where the prime minister would be directly elected by voters, with the plan guaranteeing the prime minister's coalition would receive 55 percent of seats in parliament.[^52] Critics, including opposition parties and constitutional experts, warn that this could allow authoritarianism to take root in Italy by concentrating power in the executive and undermining parliamentary checks and balances.

The Civil Liberties Union for Europe has dubbed Italy under Meloni one of five "dismantlers" that "intentionally undermine the rule of law in nearly all aspects."[^53] Concerns persist about the government's democratic credentials and its impact on the quality of Italian democracy generally.

### Academic Characterization

Leading historians and scholars have raised alarms about Meloni's government. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, David Broder, and Laurence Bertrand Dorléac have observed that Meloni and Fratelli d'Italia have been ambiguous about their fascist past, at times rejecting it and at other times minimizing it.[^54] Academic research has characterized Fratelli d'Italia as embodying "a 'gray neofascism': a form of populist, formally democratic authoritarianism that promotes a sanitized memory of fascism."[^55]

Some academics question whether Fratelli d'Italia can be defined as anything other than a post-fascist populist movement, with significant implications for the future of democracy in Italy and beyond.[^56] The characterization of her government as "the most right-wing Italian government since WWII" reflects widespread scholarly concern about the direction of Italian politics under her leadership.[^57]

## Personal Life

Giorgia Meloni's personal life has been marked by both her public commitment to traditional family values and the complexities of modern relationships that don't always conform to those ideals. Her personal experiences, including being raised by a single mother and later becoming an unmarried mother herself, add layers of complexity to her political messaging about the traditional family.

### Relationship and Separation

Meloni began a relationship with Andrea Giambruno in 2015, a journalist working for Mediaset TV channels.[^58] It's important to note that Giambruno was her partner, not her husband—the couple never married, despite Meloni's vocal advocacy for traditional marriage.[^59] Their daughter, Ginevra, was born in 2016, and Meloni has frequently spoken about motherhood as central to her identity.[^60]

The relationship ended in October 2023 when Meloni announced her split with Giambruno following the revelation of his off-air statements that were widely described as "sexist" and "chauvinist."[^61] The statements, captured without his knowledge, included Giambruno propositioning a female colleague for a threesome.[^62] The scandal was deeply embarrassing for Meloni, who had cultivated an image as a champion of women's dignity and traditional values. Her decision to publicly announce the separation was seen as an attempt to take control of the narrative and distance herself from Giambruno's behavior.

### Family Background and Relationships

Meloni's family background has profoundly shaped her worldview. Her father abandoned the family when she was just one year old, moving to the Canary Islands and leaving her mother, Anna Paratore, to raise two daughters alone.[^63][^64] This experience of paternal abandonment and being raised by a single mother created a complex relationship with her advocacy for traditional family structures—she experienced firsthand the challenges of non-traditional family arrangements, yet politically promotes a model that excludes or stigmatizes such families.

Meloni maintains a very close relationship with her older sister, Arianna, whom she described as "the most important person in my life" before the birth of her daughter Ginevra.[^65] Arianna has also been involved in politics and works closely with Giorgia in party affairs, making their relationship both personal and political.

### Self-Definition and Identity

Meloni has famously defined herself through a series of identities that capture her political philosophy: "I am Giorgia, I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, I am Christian."[^66] This declaration, made at the 2019 World Congress of Families gathering, encapsulates the traditionalist, nationalist, and religious elements of her political identity. The statement went viral and became something of a rallying cry for her supporters, though critics note the irony of someone who has never married and who was raised by a single mother championing such traditional values.

### Public Image and Personal Style

As a woman in Italian politics, Meloni has navigated the challenges of a traditionally male-dominated field. Some scholars suggest her rise may reflect a pattern in which women in politics feel compelled to adopt more extreme positions—particularly on conservative platforms—to assert authority in traditionally male-dominated spheres.[^67] Her personal style combines professional competence with appeals to maternal instinct and female dignity, creating a distinctive political persona that differs from both traditional male politicians and feminist political figures.

---

## Legacy

Although Giorgia Meloni remains in office and her ultimate historical legacy cannot yet be fully assessed, her impact on Italian and European politics is already substantial and likely to endure regardless of how long she remains in power.

### First Female Prime Minister

Meloni's most obvious legacy is being Italy's first female Prime Minister, breaking a significant glass ceiling in a country where women have historically been underrepresented in top political positions.[^68] However, this achievement is complicated by the fact that she has not championed feminist causes or women's empowerment in the way that female political leaders in other countries have. Instead, she has promoted a traditional vision of womanhood centered on motherhood and family, leading to debates about what her premiership means for gender equality in Italy.

As one analysis noted, she has pursued a "legacy of breaking glass ceilings and closing borders," combining historic firsts for women with restrictive policies on immigration and cultural openness.[^69] This complex legacy challenges simple narratives about female political leadership and progress.

### Reshaping the Italian Right

Meloni has fundamentally reshaped the Italian right-wing political landscape. By founding and building Brothers of Italy from a marginal party to the dominant force on the right, she ended the decades-long dominance of Silvio Berlusconi's political machines and Matteo Salvini's League.[^70] She demonstrated that a party with explicit roots in post-fascism could win power in a Western European democracy by moderating its tone in government while maintaining ideological coherence.

Her "double game—sovereigntist in rhetoric, pragmatic in practice"—has created a template for how far-right parties can govern in mainstream European politics without triggering the institutional and international backlash that more radical approaches might provoke.[^71] This model is being studied and potentially replicated by right-wing movements across Europe.

### European Political Influence

By 2025, Meloni had emerged as one of the most influential leaders in Europe, ranked by Politico as the most powerful person on the continent.[^72] She has positioned herself as a bridge between the mainstream conservative European People's Party and the more radical right-wing parties, giving her disproportionate influence in European politics. Her leadership of the European Conservatives and Reformists group has elevated that bloc's profile and created an alternative pole of conservative politics in the European Parliament.[^73]

### Impact on Democratic Norms

A more troubling aspect of Meloni's legacy concerns the long-term impact on Italian democratic norms and institutions. Her government's approach to press freedom, historical memory, judicial independence, and constitutional reform has raised concerns among democracy watchdogs.[^74] Even if her specific policies are reversed by future governments, the normalization of certain anti-democratic practices and rhetoric may prove difficult to undo.

The characterization of her government as representing "gray neofascism"—a form of populist, formally democratic authoritarianism—suggests that her legacy may include making previously taboo political positions and historical revisionism acceptable in mainstream Italian politics.[^75] The manipulation of historical memory regarding fascism has become a "growing political and academic concern" under her leadership.[^76]

### Gender and Power

Meloni's rise to power as a woman leading a far-right party challenges conventional assumptions about the relationship between gender and political ideology. Her success may inspire more women to enter right-wing politics, but it also complicates narratives about women's political empowerment being inherently progressive. Scholarly work on her leadership has examined how she has used "modern motherhood, neo-Catholicism, and reproductive racism" to construct a distinctively feminine form of far-right politics.[^77]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and some analysts offer several positive assessments of Giorgia Meloni's leadership and historical significance.

**Governmental Competence**: Defenders point to her record of governmental stability in a country notorious for political chaos. The fact that her government has survived more than 1,000 days and become the third-longest government of Italy's Second Republic demonstrates, in this view, a capacity for practical governance that transcends ideological concerns.[^78] Supporters argue that she has proven far more competent and pragmatic than critics feared when she took office.

**Democratic Mandate**: Meloni's supporters emphasize that she won power through democratic elections with a clear 26 percent plurality, the highest vote share of any party.[^79] She has respected the basic rules of democratic competition and has not attempted a coup or unconstitutional seizure of power. In this view, criticisms of her government as "fascist" or "authoritarian" are exaggerated and unfair characterizations of a legitimately elected conservative government.

**European Pragmatism**: Some international observers, particularly in transatlantic security circles, appreciate her pragmatic approach to foreign policy. Her strong support for Ukraine, commitment to NATO, and constructive engagement with EU institutions have made her a reliable partner on key international issues.[^80] The Atlantic Council's recognition of her with their Global Citizen Award reflects this positive assessment within establishment foreign policy circles.[^81]

**Breaking Glass Ceilings**: Supporters celebrate her status as Italy's first female Prime Minister as a historic achievement that demonstrates the possibility of women rising to the highest levels of power regardless of their political ideology.[^82] In this view, she has shown that women can be strong, decisive leaders without adopting feminist or progressive positions.

**Conservative Values**: Those who share her ideological commitments praise her defense of traditional family values, national sovereignty, and Italian cultural identity against what they see as the excesses of globalization, mass immigration, and progressive social engineering.[^83] From this perspective, she represents a necessary correction to decades of liberal policy consensus that has undermined national communities and traditional ways of life.

**Economic Realism**: Despite her populist rhetoric, Meloni has maintained fiscal discipline and avoided the economic catastrophes that befell other populist governments. Her pragmatic authorization of 500,000 work visas despite anti-immigration rhetoric shows, in this view, a willingness to adapt to economic realities.[^84]

### Negative Views

Critics, including many academics, journalists, and opposition politicians, offer harsh assessments of Meloni's leadership and its implications for democracy.

**Post-Fascist Continuity**: The most serious criticism is that Meloni leads "the most right-wing Italian government since WWII" and "the most right-wing government since 1945," representing a dangerous continuity with Italy's fascist past rather than a complete break from it.[^85][^86] Scholars emphasize that she is "the first Italian Prime Minister whose Fratelli d'Italia party could claim an institutional link to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party."[^87] Her refusal to completely repudiate her party's fascist origins and her 1996 statement calling Mussolini a "good politician" are seen as disqualifying.

**Gray Neofascism**: Academic research characterizes her party as embodying "a 'gray neofascism': a form of populist, formally democratic authoritarianism that promotes a sanitized memory of fascism."[^88] This framework suggests that while she may not be implementing classic fascism, she is creating a new authoritarian form that borrows from fascist traditions while adapting to democratic constraints. Critics warn this represents a threat to liberal democracy that is more insidious because it operates within formal democratic institutions.

**Historical Revisionism**: Historians have documented systematic abuses of historical memory under Meloni's government, including historical reassessment that minimizes fascist crimes, fake history, and evocation-cum-denial of fascist connections.[^89] Ruth Ben-Ghiat, David Broder, and Laurence Bertrand Dorléac have observed that Meloni and her party have been ambiguous about their fascist past, at times rejecting it and at other times minimizing it.[^90] This manipulation of historical memory is seen as particularly dangerous in a country that never fully reckoned with its fascist past.

**Threat to Democratic Norms**: The Civil Liberties Union for Europe's designation of Italy as one of five "dismantlers" that "intentionally undermine the rule of law in nearly all aspects" reflects deep concern about democratic backsliding.[^91] Critics point to her use of defamation lawsuits against journalists and academics, her proposed constitutional reforms that would concentrate power in the executive, and her party's tolerance of fascist symbolism among youth members as evidence of authoritarian tendencies.

**Reproductive Racism and Anti-Gender Politics**: Scholarly analysis has examined how Meloni's politics combine "anti-immigration and anti-gender stances" with "modern motherhood, neo-Catholicism, and reproductive racism."[^92] Critics argue that her vision of the traditional family is exclusionary and based on ethnic nationalism that privileges native Italian births over immigration, representing a form of demographic politics with troubling historical echoes.

**Double Game and Hypocrisy**: While some see her pragmatism as a virtue, critics characterize it as a cynical "double game—sovereigntist in rhetoric, pragmatic in practice"—that allows her to maintain extremist credentials with her base while reassuring international partners.[^93] This is seen as fundamentally dishonest and as normalizing far-right positions by making them seem compatible with mainstream governance.

**Post-Truth Politics**: Recent academic work has examined "Giorgia Meloni and the post-truth society," suggesting that her political approach relies on manipulation of facts and historical memory in ways that undermine the shared reality necessary for democratic deliberation.[^94]
