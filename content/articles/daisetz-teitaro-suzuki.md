## Summary

D. T. Suzuki was a Japanese scholar who was the most important figure in introducing Zen Buddhism to the Western world. His prolific English-language writings on Zen philosophy made it accessible to Western audiences for the first time. He influenced figures ranging from Carl Jung to the Beat poets. His interpretation of Zen, while sometimes criticized as selective, permanently changed the Western understanding of Buddhism.
