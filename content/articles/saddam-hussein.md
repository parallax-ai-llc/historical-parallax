## Summary
Saddam Hussein was the fifth President of Iraq, serving from 1979 until his overthrow in 2003. A leading member of the revolutionary Baath Party, he established a brutal authoritarian regime marked by costly wars against Iran and Kuwait, and the suppression of Shias and Kurds.

## Downfall
He was deposed during the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, captured by US forces in Operation Red Dawn, and later executed by hanging after being convicted of crimes against humanity.
