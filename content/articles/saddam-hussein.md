## Summary

Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti (April 28, 1937 – December 30, 2006) was the fifth President of Iraq, ruling from 1979 until his overthrow in 2003. Rising through the Ba'ath Party ranks, Saddam established one of the Middle East's most brutal dictatorships, characterized by extreme violence, personality cult, and regional aggression. His regime committed genocide against Kurds, waged devastating wars against Iran and Kuwait, and maintained power through systematic terror. The 2003 U.S. invasion ended his rule, and he was executed in 2006 after being convicted of crimes against humanity.
