## Summary

Andrey Markov developed the theory of Markov chains — sequences of random events where each event depends only on the preceding one. Markov chains became one of the most important concepts in probability, statistics, and computer science, with applications in speech recognition, genomics, search engines (PageRank), and machine learning.
