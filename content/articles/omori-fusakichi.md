## Summary

Omori Fusakichi was a Japanese seismologist who developed Omori's law describing the decay rate of earthquake aftershocks. He designed improved seismographs and was one of the first scientists to systematically study aftershock sequences. Ironically, he died shortly after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 while studying its aftershocks.
