## Summary

Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari was an Islamic theologian who founded the Ash'ari school of Sunni theology. After 40 years as a Mu'tazilite rationalist, he dramatically broke with them and developed a middle path that used rational argumentation to defend traditional Islamic beliefs. His theology became dominant in Sunni Islam. Key works include al-Ibana an Usul al-Diyana and Maqalat al-Islamiyyin.
