## Summary

In March 1990, as Taiwan was poised between its authoritarian past and democratic future, over 20,000 students gathered at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to demand what their parents had never dared: real elections. For six days, they occupied the plaza with their symbol, the white wild lily (百合花), representing purity and Taiwan's hope for democracy. When newly inaugurated President Lee Teng-hui met with student representatives and promised reforms, they achieved what decades of opposition had not: a commitment to end one-party rule.[^1]

The Wild Lily Movement was triggered by a constitutional crisis over the National Assembly—the "Ten-Thousand-Year Parliament" whose members, elected in mainland China in 1947, had never faced reelection. Students demanded dissolution of this relic and direct presidential elections. Lee Teng-hui, navigating between KMT hardliners and a society yearning for change, used the student movement to justify reforms he already sought.[^2]

The movement succeeded beyond its immediate goals. Within a year, the emergency provisions that justified authoritarian rule were lifted. By 1996, Taiwan held its first direct presidential election—Lee Teng-hui won with 54% of the vote. The wild lily became a symbol of Taiwan's peaceful democratization, and the students who sat at CKS Memorial became the generation that transformed their island.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Authoritarian Taiwan

Taiwan under the KMT was a one-party state:

- **1949:** KMT fled mainland after losing civil war to Communists
- **Martial law:** 1949-1987 (one of world's longest)
- **White Terror:** Tens of thousands imprisoned or killed
- **Temporary Provisions:** "Emergency" laws suspending democracy
- **Ten-Thousand-Year Parliament:** Assembly elected in 1947 never reelected[^4]

### Opening (1987-1990)

President Chiang Ching-kuo began liberalization:
- **1987:** Martial law lifted
- **1988:** Chiang died; Lee Teng-hui became first Taiwanese-born president
- **Opposition:** DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) formed 1986
- **National Assembly crisis:** Triggered the movement

### The Constitutional Crisis (March 1990)

The National Assembly met to reelect the president (indirectly). Old legislators from 1947 were still voting—a profound democratic deficit. Lee Teng-hui was confirmed by this unrepresentative body.[^5]

## The Movement

### March 16-22, 1990

**March 16:** Students from National Taiwan University began sit-in at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall

**Growth:**
- Quickly joined by students from other universities
- At peak: **~22,000** participants
- Symbol: White Formosa lily (野百合) chosen for purity, strength, Taiwan origin

**Location:** The plaza of CKS Memorial Hall—later renamed Liberty Square partly in honor of the movement[^6]

### Student Demands

The Wild Lily Movement had four core demands:

1. **Dissolve the National Assembly** (end "Ten-Thousand-Year Parliament")
2. **Abolish the Temporary Provisions** (emergency laws)
3. **Establish a timetable for political reform**
4. **Convene a National Affairs Conference** for constitutional reform

### Lee Teng-hui's Response

**March 21:** President Lee Teng-hui met with 50 student representatives at the Presidential Building

**Lee promised:**
- To work toward their goals
- To convene a National Affairs Conference
- To pursue democratic reforms

The meeting legitimized the movement and signaled Lee's reformist intentions.[^7]

### Peaceful Conclusion

**March 22:** Students ended the sit-in after Lee's commitments

No violence occurred. The movement lasted six days—remarkably brief yet transformative.

---

## No Casualties

**Deaths:** 0
**Injuries:** 0

The Wild Lily Movement was entirely peaceful—a model of nonviolent democratic transition.[^8]

## Historical Assessment

### Democratic Perspective

**Turning Point:** The Wild Lily Movement crystallized Taiwan's democratic aspirations at a critical moment. By occupying the symbolic heart of KMT authority—CKS Memorial—students delegitimized the old order. Lee Teng-hui's response transformed protest into policy.[^9]

**Peaceful Victory:** Taiwan's democratization, uniquely, involved no revolution, no regime collapse, no foreign invasion. The Wild Lily Movement was part of a gradual transition that preserved stability while achieving democracy.

### Critical Perspective

**Lee's Calculation:** Some argue Lee Teng-hui used the students to justify reforms he already wanted, outmaneuvering KMT conservatives. The students were genuine, but their impact depended on Lee's willingness to listen.

### Comparative Context

Wild Lily occurred less than a year after Tiananmen Square. Taiwan's government chose dialogue where China chose massacre. This divergence shapes each society to this day.[^10]

## Aftermath

### Immediate Reforms

**June 1990:** National Affairs Conference convened
**May 1991:** Temporary Provisions abolished
**December 1991:** First new National Assembly elected
**1992:** First fully elected Legislature

### 1996: First Direct Presidential Election

**March 1996:** Taiwan held its first direct presidential election
- Lee Teng-hui won with 54%
- First democratically elected leader in Chinese history
- Beijing fired missiles in Taiwan Strait during campaign

### Wild Lily Alumni

Many 1990 activists became leaders in Taiwan's democracy:
- Politicians, academics, activists
- Sunflower Movement (2014) explicitly connected to Wild Lily legacy[^11]
