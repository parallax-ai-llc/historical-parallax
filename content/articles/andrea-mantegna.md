## Summary

Andrea Mantegna was a major Italian Renaissance painter known for his mastery of perspective and foreshortening. His Lamentation of Christ features one of the most dramatic examples of foreshortening in art history. As court painter to the Gonzaga family, he created the illusionistic Camera degli Sposi ceiling.
