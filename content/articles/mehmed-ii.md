## Summary

Mehmed II, known as "Fatih" (the Conqueror), was Ottoman Sultan who ruled from 1444-1446 and again from 1451-1481. At age 21, he achieved what no Muslim ruler had accomplished in eight centuries: the conquest of Constantinople on May 29, 1453, ending the 1,500-year Byzantine Empire.[^1] His reign transformed the Ottoman state from a regional power into a transcontinental empire spanning Europe, Asia, and Africa. A polyglot who spoke seven languages fluently, Mehmed was both a ruthless military commander and an enlightened Renaissance patron who commissioned Italian artists and built a library of over 8,000 manuscripts.[^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Born on March 30, 1432, in Adrianople (modern Edirne), Mehmed was the third son of Sultan Murad II and Hüma Hatun, a concubine of Balkan origins from Murad's harem.[^4][^5] Some sources indicate his mother was of Greek origin, reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the Ottoman court.[^6] Despite being the third son, Mehmed's path to power opened when his older brother Ahmed died in 1437, and he was sent to govern the Black Sea province of Amasya at the tender age of five.[^7]

Mehmed's education was extraordinary for its breadth and depth. His status as a prince afforded him the finest scholars of the Islamic world, who taught him theology, history, philosophy, mathematics, and multiple foreign languages.[^8] The Islamic education he received had a profound impact on molding his worldview, particularly under his mentor Molla Gürâni, who influenced his practice of Islamic epistemology.[^9] The scholar Akshamsaddin became especially influential, instilling in the young prince the imperative of fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine Empire by conquering Constantinople.[^10]

Yet Mehmed's intellectual curiosity extended far beyond Islamic learning. From a young age, he showed intense interest in Renaissance art and Classical literature, with his school books containing caricaturistic illustrations of ancient coins and portraiture sketched in distinctly European styles.[^11] He had two tutors trained in Greek and Latin who read him Classical histories by Diogenes Laertius, Livy, and Herodotus.[^12] This synthesis of Islamic and Western learning would define his reign. By adulthood, Mehmed was fluent in seven languages: Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Serbian, and Hebrew—a linguistic prowess unmatched among contemporary rulers.[^13][^14]

When Mehmed was eleven years old, he was sent to Amasya with two lalas (advisors) to govern and gain experience, following Ottoman custom.[^15] This early exposure to governance prepared him for the tumultuous political landscape he would soon navigate. At age twelve, in August 1444, his father Murad II abdicated in his favor according to a peace treaty, making Mehmed sultan for the first time.[^16] However, when Christian forces broke the treaty and crossed the Danube in September 1444, the young sultan proved unequal to the crisis. Murad II was recalled, defeated the Crusaders at Varna on November 10, 1444, and resumed the throne, relegating Mehmed to Amasya once more.[^17][^18]

---

## Rise to Power

Mehmed ascended to the throne for the second time on February 3, 1451, following his father's death.[^19] The transition was far from peaceful. To secure his position and eliminate potential rivals, Mehmed allegedly had his infant brother drowned—a grim practice of fratricide that would later be codified in Ottoman law to prevent civil wars.[^20] This ruthless pragmatism would characterize his entire reign.

From the moment he became sultan, Mehmed's ambition was clear: Constantinople. The Byzantine capital, once the greatest city in Christendom, had dwindled to a shadow of its former glory, but its symbolic importance remained immense. No Muslim army had successfully breached its legendary Theodosian Walls in eight centuries of attempts.[^21] For Mehmed, conquest of the city was both a strategic necessity—it sat between Ottoman territories in Anatolia and the Balkans—and a religious calling, fulfillment of the Prophet Muhammad's hadith praising the future conqueror of Constantinople.[^22]

In 1451, Mehmed immediately began preparations. He strengthened the Ottoman Navy and started diplomatic maneuvering to isolate Byzantium.[^23] In 1452, he demonstrated his strategic acumen by building the fortress of Rumelihisarı (Boğazkesen) on the European shore of the Bosphorus, directly across from the earlier fortress of Anadoluhisarı.[^24][^25] This pair of fortresses gave the Ottomans complete control over the straits, strangling Constantinople's maritime lifeline. When Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI protested, Mehmed ignored him—a clear signal that war was inevitable.

Mehmed devoted himself to military innovation. He commissioned Hungarian engineer Orban to build cannons powerful enough to demolish Constantinople's massive walls.[^26] Orban produced the Basilica cannon, a monster capable of firing 270-kilogram stone balls over 1.6 kilometers.[^27] Though the weapon was slow to reload and occasionally exploded, it represented the cutting edge of 15th-century military technology. Mehmed assembled an army estimated between 80,000 and 200,000 troops, an artillery train of over seventy large field pieces, and a navy of 320 vessels.[^28][^29]

---

## Major Achievements

### The Conquest of Constantinople (1453)

On April 6, 1453, Mehmed began the siege that would define his legacy.[^30] For 53 days, Ottoman forces bombarded the ancient walls while Byzantine defenders, numbering perhaps 7,000 men, fought desperately against overwhelming odds.[^31] The siege showcased Mehmed's tactical flexibility. When the Byzantine chain blocking the Golden Horn prevented his fleet from attacking the city's sea walls, Mehmed executed one of history's most audacious maneuvers: on April 22, he had eighty galleys transported overland on greased wooden tracks around the Genoese colony of Galata and into the Golden Horn.[^32][^33]

At dawn on May 29, 1453, after a final all-night assault, Ottoman forces breached the walls. Emperor Constantine XI died fighting, and Constantinople fell after 1,123 years as capital of the Eastern Roman Empire.[^34] Mehmed, just 21 years old, had achieved the impossible. He entered Hagia Sophia, the greatest cathedral in Christendom, and ordered it converted into a mosque, though he commanded architects to "cover the Christian mosaics with plaster so that believers will not be disturbed, but do not destroy this masterpiece."[^35]

The fall of Constantinople marked a historical watershed. It ended the Byzantine Empire and, symbolically, the final vestige of ancient Rome.[^36] Greek scholars fled westward carrying precious manuscripts, contributing to the Italian Renaissance.[^37] The conquest removed a powerful Christian defense against Muslim expansion into Europe and allowed uninterrupted Ottoman advance into the Balkans.[^38] Mehmed moved the Ottoman capital from Adrianople to Constantinople, renaming it Istanbul, though the city was also known as Konstantiniyye.[^39]

### Territorial Expansion

Mehmed's conquests extended far beyond Constantinople. His military campaigns systematically absorbed territories across three continents, creating an empire that would dominate the Mediterranean for centuries.[^40]

In the **Balkans and Europe**, Mehmed occupied Serbia in 1459, with its capital falling to Ottoman forces.[^41] The Morea (Peloponnese) fell in 1460, exactly seven years after Constantinople on May 29, ending the last independent Byzantine successor state.[^42] Athens and other Greek territories were absorbed into the empire.[^43] Bosnia was annexed in 1463, becoming the westernmost Ottoman province in Southeastern Europe.[^44] After the Albanian hero Skanderbeg died in 1468, Mehmed conquered Krujë and Albania in 1478.[^45] In little more than a decade, Mehmed had wiped away the last vestiges of Byzantine rule and absorbed Serbia, the Morea, and Bosnia.[^46]

In **Anatolia**, Mehmed achieved what his great-grandfather Bayezid I had only briefly accomplished: the unification of Anatolia under Ottoman rule.[^47] He conquered territory from various Turkmen principalities, with Karaman annexed to the Ottoman Empire in 1468.[^48] His defeat of Sultan Uzun Hasan at the Battle of Başkent in 1473 secured central Anatolia and extended Ottoman authority well into Asia Minor, reaching as far as the Euphrates River.[^49][^50]

The **Venetian War (1463-1479)** demonstrated Mehmed's strategic patience and diplomatic skill. The prolonged conflict ended with Ottoman victory, giving the empire control over Albania, Bosnia, Dalmatia, southern Romania, and the Crimean peninsula.[^51][^52] This expansion made the Ottoman Empire the preeminent naval power in the eastern Mediterranean.

### Cultural and Architectural Achievements

Beyond military conquests, Mehmed enacted sweeping administrative reforms, reorganized military forces, and launched ambitious construction projects.[^53] He established the Ottoman Classical Army, creating a standing army paid by salary rather than booty or fiefs—a revolutionary system for its time.[^54]

His architectural legacy transformed Constantinople into Istanbul. The **Fatih Mosque Complex** (Fatih Külliyesi), begun in 1463 and completed seven years later under chief architect Atik Sinan, was a multi-functional complex including a mosque, two mausolea, clusters of madrasas, a hospital, hospice, soup kitchen, caravanserai, library, Qur'an school, and baths.[^55][^56] **Topkapı Palace**, constructed under Mehmed's orders, served as the primary residence of Ottoman sultans and the empire's administrative center for nearly four centuries, with sprawling gardens, courtyards, and pavilions encapsulating Ottoman grandeur.[^57] Within the palace grounds, Mehmed commissioned pavilions in Ottoman, Greek, and Persian styles, though only the Persian pavilion (Çinili Köşk) survives.[^58]

### Renaissance Patronage

Mehmed cultivated a massive multilingual library containing over 8,000 manuscripts in Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Latin, and Greek, among other languages.[^59] He supported dozens of poets, writers, and scholars, inviting philosophers, astronomers, and painters from across Europe and the Middle East to his court.[^60] Both the sultan and his grand vezirs were men of culture, and the Conqueror's court in Istanbul rivaled in brilliance that of Western princes of the European Renaissance.[^61]

From early in his reign, Mehmed invested in patronage of Italian Renaissance artists.[^62] He commissioned Matteo de' Pasti and, most famously, Gentile Bellini, the Venetian painter who created the iconic 1480 portrait of the sultan now housed in London's Victoria and Albert Museum.[^63][^64] This patronage served diplomatic purposes, signaling to Italian states like Naples and Florence that the Ottoman court was cultured and sophisticated.[^65]

### Military Innovation

By Mehmed's reign, the Janissaries had become "perhaps the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world," drilled with guns rather than traditional bows and arrows.[^66][^67] The Ottomans preceded both European and Middle Eastern adversaries in establishing centralized troops specialized in manufacturing and handling firearms.[^68] Mehmed effectively combined traditional cavalry tactics with gunpowder weapons, exemplifying what historians call the "military revolution" of the 15th century.[^69][^70]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Sack of Constantinople

While Mehmed's conquest is celebrated in Turkish and Islamic history, the immediate aftermath involved significant violence. For three days, Ottoman troops were given license to plunder the city.[^71] Throughout the morning of May 29, massacre and plunder reigned.[^72] Prisoners were seized for ransom or to be sold "like sheep," houses were broken into, palaces were gutted and stripped bare.[^73] The population sought sanctuary in Hagia Sophia cathedral, where Turkish troops broke down the doors with axes—some people were massacred, but most were herded out as captives to be sold into slavery.[^74] Thousands of inhabitants were killed or enslaved.[^75]

Mehmed attempted to limit the destruction and, on the third day, ordered all looting to stop and sent troops back outside the city walls.[^76][^77] Nevertheless, the trauma inflicted on Constantinople's Christian population was immense, and many Orthodox churches were destroyed during the initial period of sanctioned looting.[^78]

### Economic Exploitation and Resentment

In his relentless search for revenues to fund constant military campaigns, Mehmed created monopolies over essential goods, distributing them among the highest bidders who then charged excessive prices to the population.[^79] He established that all revenue-producing property belonged to the sultan and confiscated much private property and religious foundation lands (waqf), creating tremendous resentment among those who lost their revenues.[^80] These economic policies, while effective in funding his military machine, created internal tensions within Ottoman society and bred discontent among traditional elites.[^81]

### Military Failures

Despite his many victories, Mehmed suffered notable defeats. The **Siege of Belgrade in 1456** was probably the most significant military failure of his reign.[^82] After conquering Constantinople, Mehmed sought to expand into Europe by capturing Belgrade, a strategically positioned fortress. From July 4-22, 1456, Mehmed besieged the city with 60,000-70,000 men against a garrison of 5,000-7,000 defenders.[^83][^84] Hungarian commander John Hunyadi broke the naval blockade on July 14 and reinforced the city.[^85] During the final Ottoman assault on July 21-22, Mehmed was struck by an arrow in the thigh and knocked unconscious from his horse, shattering Ottoman morale.[^86][^87] The Ottomans retreated hastily, and Belgrade became "the first glimmer of hope in the West after the fall of Constantinople."[^88] Modern historians view Mehmed's prioritization of capturing the fortress over countering the relief army as "a tactical blunder."[^89]

### Brutal Treatment of Enemies

Mehmed's conflicts were marked by extreme violence that generated fear throughout Europe. His war with **Vlad III of Wallachia** (Vlad the Impaler) demonstrated the brutality on both sides. Vlad and Mehmed had grown up together as youths when Vlad was held hostage in the Ottoman Empire.[^90] When Vlad stopped paying tribute and impaled the Sultan's two envoys, Mehmed launched a 1462 campaign to replace him with his brother Radu.[^91][^92] After Vlad's night attack at Târgoviște on June 17, 1462, Mehmed discovered a "forest of the impaled"—approximately 20,000-23,844 impaled Turkish soldiers and Bulgarian Muslims along a 60-mile stretch.[^93][^94][^95] Though Vlad was eventually forced into exile, the conflict illustrated the extreme violence characteristic of the era and Mehmed's willingness to respond to brutality with equal ferocity.[^96]

### Alleged Fratricide

Mehmed's reign allegedly began with the murder of his infant brother to avoid future power struggles.[^97] The Venetian ambassador and his son were executed after Constantinople's fall.[^98] These acts, while consistent with Ottoman succession practices designed to prevent civil war, contributed to Mehmed's fearsome reputation. Europeans were terrified of this Ottoman ruler and celebrated his death.[^99][^100] European propaganda portrayed Mehmed as a barbaric threat to Christendom, though the sultan's own image-makers sometimes encouraged and amplified Western fears of "The Grand Turk" rather than denying them.[^101] Venice even attempted multiple assassination plots against Mehmed, reflecting the intense opposition he generated.[^102]

## Personal Life

### Physical Appearance and Personality

Mehmed was described as a tall, strong, and muscular man.[^103] He possessed a strong personality that attracted respect from both subjects and enemies.[^104] Known for his relentless determination and strategic acumen, Mehmed had a lifelong commitment to learning and intellectual pursuits.[^105][^106] His proficiency in multiple languages—Arabic, Persian, Latin, French, Greek, Serbian, and Hebrew—reflected his cosmopolitan worldview.[^107][^108] He was also a patron of the arts who encouraged scholarship and architecture.[^109]

### Wives and Family

Mehmed II had at least eight known wives or partners, making him the last sultan to legally marry multiple women until Suleiman the Magnificent in the 1500s.[^110][^111] His wives included:

**Gülbahar Hatun**, mother of his successor Bayezid II and daughter Gevherhan Hatun.[^112][^113] **Sittişah Mukrime Hatun** was his first legal wife, daughter of a ruler from another Turkish state, though their marriage was unhappy and produced no children.[^114] **Gülşah Hatun** bore Şehzade Mustafa in 1450.[^115] **Çiçek Hatun** gave birth to Cem Sultan on December 22, 1459.[^116] **Helena Hatun**, daughter of the ruler of Morea, likely became his second legal wife after his conquest of that region.[^117] **Anna Hatun**, daughter of the Greek emperor of Trebizond, entered Mehmed's palace after that city's conquest and later married Zaganos Mehmed Pasha.[^118] **Maria Hatun**, widow of a prince from Trebizond, was considered very beautiful.[^119] **Hatice Hatun**, daughter of Zaganos Mehmed Pasha, likely became Mehmed's third legal wife in 1463.[^120]

His children included **Bayezid II**, his eldest son and eventual successor; **Şehzade Mustafa** (born 1450); **Cem Sultan** (born December 22, 1459), who would later contest the succession; and **Gevherhan Hatun**, daughter and full-sister of Bayezid II.[^121][^122][^123]

## Legacy

### Historical Impact

Mehmed II's reign fundamentally altered world history. The conquest of Constantinople in 1453 marked the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, ending the Roman Empire that had begun in approximately 27 BC and lasted nearly 1,500 years.[^124][^125] The fall of Constantinople was a watershed moment, effectively ending the Byzantine Empire and forcing Greek scholars to flee westward, carrying ancient manuscripts that ignited the Italian Renaissance.[^126][^127]

The conquest opened Europe to Ottoman expansion and removed a powerful Christian defense against Muslim advance.[^128] For the next four centuries, the territories Mehmed captured in Anatolia and the Balkans would constitute the Ottoman Empire's heartland.[^129] His transformation of Constantinople into Istanbul created a cosmopolitan imperial capital that bridged Europe and Asia, symbolizing the Ottoman Empire's unique position between civilizations.

### Cultural Legacy

Mehmed's massive multilingual library and patronage of scholars across religions and cultures established Istanbul as a center of learning rivaling any European capital.[^130][^131] His commissioning of Italian Renaissance artists and architects created a unique synthesis of Islamic, Byzantine, and Western European artistic traditions.[^132] The Fatih Mosque, Topkapı Palace, and other architectural projects transformed Istanbul's skyline and established Ottoman architectural standards for generations.[^133]

### Modern Remembrance

Mehmed is considered a hero in modern Turkey and much of the Muslim world.[^134] Istanbul's Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, and Fatih Mosque bear his name, and his conquest of Constantinople remains a source of national pride.[^135] Turkish historiography emphasizes his role as a unifier who brought stability, promoted culture, and established the Ottoman Empire as a world power.

In the West, historical assessment has evolved from the medieval view of Mehmed as a barbaric threat to Christendom to a more nuanced understanding of him as a complex Renaissance prince who combined military genius with cultural sophistication. His legacy remains contested—simultaneously celebrated as a great conqueror and condemned for the violence of his campaigns.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians widely recognize Mehmed as "a great military leader" who "captured Constantinople and conquered the territories in Anatolia and the Balkans that constituted the Ottoman Empire's heartland for the next four centuries."[^136] Military historians credit him with innovativeness, noting that "he effectively combined traditional cavalry tactics with new gunpowder weapons, a hallmark of what some historians call the 'military revolution' of the 15th century."[^137][^138]

His patronage of arts and literature worked toward promoting imperial authority and legitimacy, especially in newly conquered lands.[^139] He is recognized as "a benefactor of artists and authors" whose court rivaled European Renaissance princes in brilliance.[^140][^141] Administrative historians praise him for doing away with biases and nepotism, selecting officials based on merit rather than aristocratic lineage.[^142]

The religious tolerance embodied in the millet system is often highlighted as progressive for its era. Mehmed's appointment of Gennadios Scholarius as Patriarch and his welcome of persecuted Jews from Western Europe demonstrated pragmatic multiculturalism that allowed diverse communities to coexist under Ottoman rule.[^143][^144]

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize the economic exploitation that funded Mehmed's military campaigns. His monopolies over essential goods, distribution of revenue-producing property to highest bidders, and confiscation of private property and waqf lands created "tremendous resentment among those who lost their revenues."[^145] His expansionist policies "cost the empire greatly, which led to discontent" among the population bearing the tax burden.[^146]

Military historians note tactical errors, particularly at Belgrade, where his prioritization of capturing the fortress over countering the relief army was "a tactical blunder by modern historians."[^147] The violence of his conquests, including the sack of Constantinople and conflicts like the war with Vlad III, demonstrated a ruthlessness that terrified contemporaries and complicated his legacy.[^148]

The fratricide that began his reign and the executions of rivals established a precedent for Ottoman succession that would lead to centuries of bloodshed. While defenders argue this prevented civil wars, critics view it as unjustifiable political murder that normalized extreme violence within the Ottoman ruling family.[^149]

## Famous Quotes

> "We do not conquer the lands, we conquer the hearts." - Mehmed II[^150]

This quote reflects Mehmed's understanding that lasting rule required winning the loyalty of conquered peoples, not merely defeating their armies. His religious tolerance policies and patronage of diverse cultures embodied this philosophy.

> "Either I will conquer Istanbul or Istanbul will conquer me." - Attributed to Mehmed before the 1453 siege[^151]

This declaration, popularized in Turkish culture, captures the all-or-nothing determination with which the 21-year-old sultan approached the siege of Constantinople. It proved prophetic—his conquest of the city defined his identity and legacy.

> "There must be only one empire, one faith, and one sovereignty in the world." - Mehmed II[^152]

This quote reveals Mehmed's imperial ambitions and vision of universal Ottoman dominance. It reflected both Islamic concepts of dar al-Islam and Roman imperial ideology, showing how Mehmed saw himself as heir to multiple imperial traditions.

> "Cover the Christian mosaics with plaster so that the believers will not be disturbed. But do not destroy this masterpiece." - Mehmed to architects regarding Hagia Sophia[^153]

This instruction demonstrates Mehmed's appreciation for Byzantine art and his pragmatic approach to converting the great cathedral into a mosque. Rather than destroying the mosaics, he ordered them preserved beneath plaster—a decision that allowed their eventual restoration centuries later.

> "Let the Genoese merchants travel and trade freely. We will not take their children to join the Janissary corps nor will we ever use force against those who do not accept our religion." - Mehmed II[^154]

This quote illustrates Mehmed's pragmatic tolerance and understanding of economic realities. By guaranteeing religious freedom and exempting Genoese from the devshirme system, he encouraged trade and stability in his newly conquered territories.
