## Summary

Bùi Diễm (October 1, 1923 – October 24, 2021) was one of South Vietnam's most prominent diplomats, serving as ambassador to the United States under President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu from 1967 to 1972 during the critical years of the Vietnam War. The nephew of Trần Trọng Kim, Prime Minister under Emperor Bảo Đại, Bùi Diễm played a pivotal role in representing South Vietnam's interests in Washington, navigating complex relationships between American and South Vietnamese leadership during one of history's most contentious conflicts.[^1][^2] After the fall of Saigon in 1975, he became a scholar and memoirist, authoring the acclaimed book "In the Jaws of History" (1987), which provided an insider's perspective on the war from the South Vietnamese viewpoint.[^3] His career spanned journalism, diplomacy, and academia, making him a crucial voice in understanding the Vietnam War's political dimensions.

## Early Life and Background

Bùi Diễm was born on October 1, 1923, in Phủ Lý, Hà Nam province, in French Indochina, into a family with significant political connections that would shape his future trajectory.[^4] His uncle, Trần Trọng Kim, served as Prime Minister of the Empire of Vietnam under Emperor Bảo Đại in 1945, providing young Bùi Diễm with direct exposure to the highest levels of Vietnamese politics during a crucial transitional period.[^5] From an early age, he demonstrated exceptional scholarly abilities, particularly excelling in mathematics, which earned him recognition among his peers and educators.[^6]

His political awakening came during his studies at Pomelo School, where he became involved in nationalist activities. In 1944, while still a student, Bùi Diễm joined the Đại Việt Nationalist Party (Đảng Đại Việt) through the introduction of a friend, marking the beginning of his lifelong commitment to Vietnamese nationalism and anti-communist politics.[^7] The Đại Việt party, created by nationalist-minded students in the late 1930s, advocated for a "Greater Vietnam" that would be modern, either Republican or Monarchist, but decidedly non-communist and anti-colonialist.[^8]

Growing up during the tumultuous years of World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indochina, Bùi Diễm witnessed firsthand the collapse of French colonial authority and the emergence of competing visions for Vietnam's future. His uncle's brief tenure as Prime Minister in 1945, during the Japanese-backed Vietnamese government, exposed him to the complexities of navigating between occupying powers, nationalist aspirations, and the emerging communist movement led by Hồ Chí Minh.[^9] These formative experiences during the 1940s instilled in him a deep commitment to Vietnamese independence combined with fierce opposition to communism, principles that would guide his entire career.

The political education Bùi Diễm received through his family connections and early political involvement prepared him for leadership roles at a remarkably young age. His fluency in both English and French, combined with his mathematical aptitude and political acumen, positioned him as an ideal representative for South Vietnam in international forums.[^10] This multilingual capability and intellectual sophistication would prove invaluable in his later diplomatic career, enabling him to navigate the complex cultural and political landscapes of both Vietnamese and American politics.

## Rise to Power

Bùi Diễm's ascent in South Vietnamese politics accelerated rapidly in the post-World War II period. At the remarkably young age of 31, he was appointed as a member of the State of Vietnam's delegation to the pivotal 1954 Geneva Conference, which would determine the fate of Indochina following France's defeat at Điện Biên Phủ.[^11] This appointment demonstrated the trust placed in him by the anti-communist Vietnamese leadership and marked his emergence as a significant diplomatic figure. During the Geneva negotiations, Bùi Diễm and his foreign minister, Trần Văn Đỗ, were strongly opposed to the partition of Vietnam at the 17th parallel, refusing to accept the declaration that resulted from the conference.[^12]

Following the Geneva Conference, Bùi Diễm established himself in South Vietnam not only as a diplomat but also as a media entrepreneur and advocate for democratic principles. In 1963, he founded the Saigon Post, which became the first English-language newspaper in South Vietnam, operating until the fall of Saigon in 1975.[^13] The establishment of the Saigon Post represented Bùi Diễm's commitment to creating a free and independent press in Vietnam, providing English-speaking audiences with South Vietnamese perspectives on the escalating conflict.[^14] This journalistic venture demonstrated his understanding of the importance of international public opinion and media narratives in the broader struggle for South Vietnam's survival.

His combination of diplomatic experience, media influence, and political connections made Bùi Diễm an increasingly valuable asset to the South Vietnamese government. By the mid-1960s, as American involvement in Vietnam dramatically escalated, he served as chief of staff to the prime minister, positioning him at the center of South Vietnamese decision-making during the crucial period when President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed American combat troops in 1965.[^15] This role gave him intimate knowledge of the complex and often fraught relationship between South Vietnamese and American leadership, including firsthand experience with American unilateral decision-making that often excluded South Vietnamese input.

In 1967, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu appointed Bùi Diễm as Vietnamese Ambassador to the United States, the most critical diplomatic posting for South Vietnam during the war.[^16] This appointment placed him at the nexus of American-South Vietnamese relations at a time when the war's trajectory hung in the balance. Historical documents show that by June 1967, Bùi Diễm was already actively engaged in high-level meetings with U.S. officials, traveling frequently between Washington and Saigon to coordinate policy positions.[^17] His relationship with President Thiệu was complex but functional, with Bùi Diễm serving as a crucial liaison between Thiệu's government and American officials, regularly carrying messages and attempting to bridge the growing divide between the two allies.[^18]

## Major Achievements

As South Vietnam's ambassador to the United States from 1967 to 1972, and subsequently as ambassador-at-large until 1975, Bùi Diễm achieved significant diplomatic accomplishments under extraordinarily challenging circumstances.[^19] His primary achievement was maintaining channels of communication between the South Vietnamese and American governments during periods of intense strain, when mutual frustrations threatened to undermine the alliance entirely. He developed extensive networks within the American political establishment, cultivating relationships with senators, administration officials, and influential figures across the political spectrum, which proved invaluable in advocating for South Vietnam's interests.[^20]

One of Bùi Diễm's most significant contributions was his role in representing South Vietnam during the Paris Peace negotiations. He was a member of the negotiating team appointed by President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu for the Paris Peace Accords, participating in the complex diplomatic maneuvering that ultimately led to the 1973 agreement.[^21] His position required him to balance President Thiệu's legitimate concerns about South Vietnam's security with American pressure to conclude a peace settlement that would allow U.S. withdrawal. This delicate balancing act demonstrated his diplomatic skills and deep understanding of both Vietnamese and American political imperatives.

His journalistic achievement in founding the Saigon Post represented another major accomplishment that extended beyond traditional diplomacy. By creating the first English-language newspaper in South Vietnam, Bùi Diễm established a platform for presenting South Vietnamese perspectives to international audiences, journalists, and diplomats stationed in Saigon.[^22] The newspaper operated throughout the most intense years of the war, from 1963 to 1975, providing continuous coverage and commentary that challenged both communist propaganda and sometimes critical American media narratives.[^23]

In the war's final desperate months, Bùi Diễm made heroic efforts to secure American support for South Vietnam's survival. In mid-March 1975, following the fall of Ban Me Thuot, he arrived in Washington on March 23rd to lobby for emergency military aid of $700 million to defend South Vietnam against the North Vietnamese offensive.[^24] Though ultimately unsuccessful due to congressional opposition and American war weariness, his tireless advocacy demonstrated unwavering commitment to his country's cause. He "tried his best to knock at the door of friends and all those he knew in Washington calling for help," even as the situation deteriorated rapidly.[^25]

After the war, Bùi Diễm achieved scholarly recognition through his memoir "In the Jaws of History," co-written with David Chanoff and published in 1987 by Houghton Mifflin.[^26] The Washington Post called it "the ultimate insider's account of the war from the South Vietnamese side," and it remains one of the most important books written on the Vietnam War from the perspective of South Vietnamese officials.[^27] The memoir provided penetrating insights into the failures of the American-South Vietnamese alliance and the limited imagination that America had for South Vietnam's future, offering historical perspective unavailable from American sources alone.[^28] His subsequent scholarly positions at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the American Enterprise Institute, and as a research professor at George Mason University allowed him to continue contributing to understanding of the war and its consequences.[^29][^30]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Bùi Diễm's career was significantly marked by his central role in the controversial "Anna Chennault Affair" during the 1968 presidential election, which remains one of the most contentious episodes in Vietnam War history. Nixon allegedly used Anna Chennault, the Chinese-born widow of wealthy businessman Claire Chennault, as a backchannel to South Vietnamese President Thiệu via Ambassador Bùi Diễm to undermine President Lyndon B. Johnson's efforts to start peace talks before the November election.[^31] When President Thiệu suddenly refused to participate in the Paris talks, Johnson ordered the FBI to wiretap Bùi Diễm and follow Chennault to discover evidence of collusion with the Nixon campaign.[^32]

The FBI recorded a telephone call from Chennault to Bùi Diễm in which she "advised him that her boss…wanted her to give personally to the ambassador" a message to "hold on, we are gonna win."[^33] President Johnson, upon learning of these contacts, called the situation "treason" when speaking with Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen.[^34] William Bundy, Johnson's assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, summoned Bùi Diễm to a meeting at which he accused him of "improper" and "unethical" contacts with Chennault.[^35] However, Bùi Diễm repeatedly denied making any deals with the Nixon campaign to sabotage the peace talks, maintaining throughout his life that his actions were appropriate advocacy for South Vietnam's national interests.[^36]

Historian John A. Farrell argued that Nixon's encouragement, via Chennault and potentially Bùi Diễm, of Thiệu's obstinance had ended hope for peace for purely partisan reasons, making it the "most reprehensible" of all Nixon's actions.[^37] The affair raises profound questions about whether Bùi Diễm's actions prolonged the war and resulted in unnecessary casualties, or whether he was simply representing his government's legitimate concerns about a peace agreement that would leave South Vietnam vulnerable to communist takeover. This controversy has never been fully resolved, with interpretations varying based on political perspectives regarding the war itself.

Beyond the Chennault Affair, Bùi Diễm faced criticism regarding the broader relationship between South Vietnam and the United States. In his interviews and writings, he acknowledged that "the way the Americans behaved created among the South Vietnamese a lot of habits, a lot of bad habits," suggesting that American patronage fostered dependency rather than self-reliance in South Vietnamese institutions.[^38] He also noted that "in 1965 when the American came in South Vietnam and in 1972 by the time they left South Vietnam, it was mainly through their own decisions and for their own reasons and very little attention to the fate of the South Vietnamese had been paid."[^39]

Some critics have argued that Bùi Diễm and other South Vietnamese leaders failed to adequately reform their government or build sufficient popular support, contributing to South Vietnam's ultimate collapse. His close association with President Thiệu's increasingly authoritarian regime raised questions about his commitment to the democratic principles he advocated through the Saigon Post. Additionally, his inability to prevent the erosion of American support for South Vietnam, despite his extensive Washington connections, has been cited as evidence of diplomatic failure, though this criticism may underestimate the overwhelming political forces working against continued American involvement by the early 1970s.

## Personal Life

Bùi Diễm married Vũ Thị Kim Ngọc, and their marriage lasted an extraordinary 73 years until his death in 2021, representing a remarkable partnership that endured war, exile, and dramatic changes in fortune.[^40] Together they had three children: two daughters, Ann Ngọc La (who married Dũng Quí La) and Gabrielle Dang, and one son named Han Bùi.[^41] The family also included four grandchildren—Anh Sawyer (married to Thomas Sawyer), Hùng Quí La (married to Léa Dickely), Vũ Dang, and Indy Hùng Bùi—and two great-grandchildren, Chloe Sawyer and Mia Sawyer.[^42]

After the fall of Saigon in 1975, Bùi Diễm and his family settled in the United States, initially living in Rockville, Maryland.[^43] The transition from ambassador to refugee required remarkable personal resilience and adaptability. In a dramatic change from his previous life of diplomatic privilege, Bùi Diễm initially ran a Jewish delicatessen to support his family.[^44] He later borrowed money and became part-owner of Goldberg's Delly in downtown Washington, operating the business until 1982 while simultaneously beginning his scholarly career.[^45] This period demonstrated both his practical willingness to do whatever was necessary to provide for his family and his determination to rebuild his life in exile.

His fluency in English and French facilitated his transition to American academic life, where he eventually secured positions at prestigious institutions including the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the American Enterprise Institute, and George Mason University.[^46] These scholarly positions allowed him to return to intellectual work more befitting his background and experience, while also providing him a platform to preserve and transmit the historical memory of South Vietnam's struggle. Throughout his exile, he maintained connections with the Vietnamese diaspora community while also engaging with American scholars, policymakers, and the general public about the Vietnam War's lessons and legacy.

Bùi Diễm left Vietnam just a few days before the collapse in April 1975 and never returned to his homeland, living the remaining 46 years of his life in the United States.[^47] In interviews, he reflected with both sadness and pragmatism on this permanent exile, noting that he had personally thought "long before '75 that the United States would not come back to help again South Vietnam."[^48] Despite the traumatic end of his diplomatic career and his country's defeat, he remained intellectually engaged with Vietnam-related issues throughout his long life. He appeared as a witness in Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's acclaimed PBS documentary series "The Vietnam War" in 2017, providing firsthand testimony about the war's events and his experiences.[^49]

Bùi Diễm passed away peacefully in his sleep on October 24, 2021, in Potomac, Maryland, at the age of 98, surrounded by his large extended family.[^50] His longevity allowed him to witness dramatic transformations in both Vietnam and U.S.-Vietnam relations, including the normalization of diplomatic ties and Vietnam's integration into the global economy—developments that validated some of his beliefs about Vietnamese nationalism while also rendering moot the Cold War ideological struggles that had defined his career.

## Legacy

Bùi Diễm's legacy rests primarily on his role as the most articulate and sophisticated diplomatic representative of South Vietnam during the war's critical years, and as one of the most important chroniclers of the conflict from the South Vietnamese perspective. His memoir "In the Jaws of History" remains essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the war beyond American perspectives, offering insights into South Vietnamese political dynamics, the complex relationship between Saigon and Washington, and the tragedy of a nationalist cause defeated not only by military force but also by political abandonment.[^51]

His scholarly work after the war contributed significantly to American understanding of South Vietnamese viewpoints and motivations. Through his positions at the Woodrow Wilson Center, the American Enterprise Institute, and George Mason University, Bùi Diễm ensured that South Vietnam's story would not be forgotten or reduced to simplistic narratives.[^52] He consistently challenged the view that the war was simply American imperialism, instead presenting it as a complex struggle involving Vietnamese nationalism, communist expansion, and the limits of American commitment—a perspective that, while contested, added necessary nuance to historical understanding.

For the Vietnamese diaspora community, Bùi Diễm served as an important symbol of South Vietnam's nationalist cause and its ultimate betrayal by American allies. His experience as "the last ambassador to the United States" from South Vietnam gave him unique authority to speak about the war's end and its meaning for Vietnamese refugees.[^53] His continued advocacy for understanding South Vietnam's perspective, even decades after the war's end, helped maintain historical memory within exile communities that might otherwise have been overwhelmed by the dominant narrative of communist Vietnam.

Bùi Diễm's criticism of both American and South Vietnamese conduct during the war has proven prescient and valuable for historical understanding. His observation that "the situation could be different if less mistakes were committed by the Americans and less mistakes were committed by the South Vietnamese" reflects a balanced assessment rare among participants in such a polarizing conflict.[^54] His willingness to acknowledge South Vietnamese shortcomings while also documenting American failures provides a model of honest historical reflection.

In broader diplomatic history, Bùi Diễm's career illustrates the profound challenges faced by representatives of client states dependent on great power support. His experience navigating between his government's legitimate concerns and his ally's domestic political constraints offers lessons relevant to contemporary international relations. His ultimate inability to prevent American abandonment of South Vietnam, despite his diplomatic skills and extensive American contacts, demonstrates the limits of even the most capable diplomacy when confronting overwhelming political forces and fundamental shifts in public opinion.

The controversy surrounding the Anna Chennault Affair continues to complicate his legacy, with interpretations varying based on broader views of the war itself. Those sympathetic to South Vietnam tend to view his actions as legitimate advocacy for his country's interests, while critics see potential complicity in prolonging a war for partisan American political advantage. This unresolved controversy ensures that Bùi Diễm remains a contested figure in Vietnam War historiography, his legacy inseparable from ongoing debates about the war's conduct and meaning.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and commentators sympathetic to South Vietnam's cause have consistently praised Bùi Diễm as one of South Vietnam's most capable and sophisticated leaders, particularly in comparison to many of his contemporaries. His intellectual accomplishments, linguistic abilities, and genuine commitment to democratic principles distinguished him from more authoritarian or corrupt South Vietnamese officials who damaged their government's credibility. Historian David Chanoff, who co-authored Bùi Diễm's memoir, worked closely with him and presented him as a thoughtful, reflective leader genuinely committed to Vietnamese independence and modernization rather than mere anti-communism.[^55]

Defenders of Bùi Diễm's role in the Chennault Affair argue that he was simply representing his government's legitimate interests in ensuring that any peace agreement would not abandon South Vietnam to communist takeover. From this perspective, President Thiệu's concerns about the proposed Paris negotiations were entirely justified given North Vietnam's continued commitment to conquering the South, and Bùi Diễm's communications with American political figures were appropriate diplomatic advocacy rather than treason or sabotage.[^56] This view holds that the real betrayal came later, when the United States failed to enforce the Paris Accords or provide promised military aid when North Vietnam violated the agreement.

The scholarly reception of "In the Jaws of History" has been largely positive, with many historians acknowledging its importance in providing South Vietnamese perspectives often absent from Western accounts. The Washington Post's description of it as "the ultimate insider's account of the war from the South Vietnamese side" reflects widespread recognition of its historical value.[^57] The book's penetrating analysis of American failures—including unilateral decision-making, cultural insensitivity, and the creation of dependency through overwhelming assistance—has been validated by subsequent scholarship and has influenced how historians understand the alliance's dysfunction.

His post-war scholarly career at prestigious American institutions demonstrated that even critics of South Vietnam's government recognized Bùi Diễm's intellectual capabilities and the value of his insights. His appointments to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the American Enterprise Institute, despite the controversial aspects of his wartime role, suggest that American scholars and policymakers valued his perspectives and saw him as a credible analyst rather than merely a partisan advocate.[^58] His appearance in Ken Burns's authoritative Vietnam War documentary series further validates his importance as a historical witness whose testimony enriches understanding of the conflict.[^59]

Among the Vietnamese diaspora, Bùi Diễm is often viewed as a heroic figure who remained loyal to South Vietnam's cause even in defeat and exile, maintaining the historical memory of South Vietnamese nationalism against both communist propaganda and American narratives that sometimes delegitimized South Vietnam's very existence. His scholarly work and public advocacy helped ensure that the South Vietnamese experience would not be erased from history, providing future generations with access to perspectives that might otherwise have been lost.

### Negative Views

Critics of Bùi Diễm, particularly those who opposed the Vietnam War or are sympathetic to the communist victory, view him as a representative of an illegitimate regime propped up by American imperialism. From this perspective, his diplomatic sophistication and intellectual accomplishments merely made him a more effective advocate for a fundamentally flawed cause—the perpetuation of a corrupt, authoritarian government that lacked genuine popular support among the Vietnamese people. These critics argue that South Vietnam's eventual collapse vindicated this assessment, demonstrating that no amount of diplomatic skill could compensate for the regime's fundamental illegitimacy.[^60]

The Chennault Affair remains the most damaging aspect of Bùi Diễm's legacy for his critics. Historian John A. Farrell's assessment that Nixon's actions, potentially facilitated by Bùi Diễm and Chennault, constituted "the most reprehensible" of Nixon's many controversial actions carries enormous weight.[^61] If Bùi Diễm indeed participated in undermining peace negotiations for partisan political advantage, this would represent a profound moral failure that prolonged the war and caused thousands of unnecessary deaths. President Johnson's characterization of the affair as "treason" and William Bundy's accusations of "improper" and "unethical" conduct reflect the gravity with which American officials viewed his actions.[^62]

Some scholars argue that Bùi Diễm's memoirs and post-war scholarship, while valuable as historical sources, fundamentally evade responsibility for South Vietnam's failures. His tendency to blame American mistakes while minimizing South Vietnamese corruption, authoritarianism, and political repression represents self-serving revisionism in this view. Critics note that despite his advocacy for a free press through the Saigon Post, he served a regime that routinely suppressed dissent and failed to implement democratic reforms that might have built broader popular support.

His diplomatic failure to maintain American support for South Vietnam, despite his extensive connections and years of effort, has been cited as evidence that even the most capable South Vietnamese leaders could not overcome the fundamental problems with their government and cause. From this perspective, Bùi Diễm's inability to convince American policymakers and the public to continue supporting South Vietnam reflected not American betrayal but rather a rational assessment that South Vietnam could not survive without indefinite American military commitment—an unsustainable proposition.[^63]

The controversial nature of American involvement in Vietnam inevitably colors assessments of all participants, and Bùi Diễm remains a polarizing figure whose legacy cannot be separated from broader debates about the war's justification, conduct, and outcome. His sophisticated advocacy for South Vietnam's cause either represents noble dedication to national independence or tragic complicity in a doomed and illegitimate enterprise, depending on one's fundamental perspective on the conflict itself.
