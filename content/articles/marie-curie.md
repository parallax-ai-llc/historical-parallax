## Summary

Marie Skłodowska Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish-born French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity, a term she coined. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Physics 1903, Chemistry 1911), and the first female professor at the University of Paris. Along with her husband Pierre Curie, she discovered the radioactive elements polonium (named after her native Poland) and radium. Her work laid the foundation for the development of X-rays in surgery and revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in science and enduring poverty, illness from radiation exposure, and personal tragedy, Curie persevered to become one of history's most important scientists. She remains an icon of female achievement in STEM fields.

## Early Life in Poland

### Birth and Family

Maria Skłodowska was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire (Poland had been partitioned and didn't exist as an independent state). She was the youngest of five children born to Bronisława (née Boguska), a teacher and pianist, and Władysław Skłodowski, a mathematics and physics teacher.

The family was intellectual but impoverished, having lost their property and fortunes supporting Polish nationalist causes. Both parents valued education highly, despite the Russian authorities' efforts to suppress Polish culture and learning.

### Childhood Hardships

Maria's childhood was marked by tragedy:
- **Age 8**: Eldest sister Zofia died of typhus
- **Age 10**: Mother Bronisława died of tuberculosis after a five-year illness

These losses profoundly affected Maria, shaking her Catholic faith and hardening her resolve. She excelled in school despite the emotional pain, graduating from gymnasium (high school) at age 15 with a gold medal.

### The Governess Years

Russian authorities banned women from university education. Unable to attend university in Poland, Maria made a pact with her sister Bronisława: Maria would work as a governess to fund Bronisława's medical education in Paris, then Bronisława would support Maria's education in return.

From 1885-1889, Maria worked as a governess for wealthy families, sending money to Bronisława. During this period:
- She fell in love with Kazimierz Żorawski, son of her employers, but his family forbade marriage to a poor governess
- She taught herself mathematics and physics from her father's books
- She joined the "Flying University," a secret underground school teaching Polish language and culture

This period of hardship built Maria's formidable determination and self-discipline.

## Paris and the Sorbonne

### Journey to France

In 1891, age 24, Maria traveled to Paris to study at the Sorbonne (University of Paris). She was one of very few women enrolled. She changed her name to the French "Marie" and lived in a  tiny, unheated attic room, often eating nothing but bread and tea to afford books and tuition.

Despite poverty and inadequate preparation (Russian gymnasiums taught less science than French lycées), Marie threw herself into studies:
- Graduated first in her physics degree (1893)
- Graduated second in mathematics degree (1894)
- Worked in an industrial laboratory studying magnetic properties of steel

### Meeting Pierre Curie

In 1894, Marie met Pierre Curie, a brilliant French physicist known for discovering piezoelectricity with his brother Jacques. Pierre, age 35, was unmarried, devoted to science, and initially had resisted romantic entanglements.

They bonded over shared passion for science. Pierre was captivated by Marie's intellect and determination. After a year-long courtship conducted through discussions of physics and letters filled with scientific ideas, they married on July 26, 1895, in a simple civil ceremony. In lieu of a honeymoon trip, they toured France on bicycles, a hobby they both loved.

**The Partnership:**
Their marriage was an intellectual partnership as well as romantic. They would work together for a decade, making discoveries that transformed physics and earned them a shared Nobel Prize.

## Discovery of Radioactivity

### Becquerel's Mystery

In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium emitted mysterious rays that could expose photographic plates. This phenomenon was unexplained and largely ignored by most physicists.

Marie chose this topic for her doctoral research, seeing an opportunity to explore something new. She began systematically testing elements to see if any others emitted similar rays. Her approach was meticulous and quantitative, using an electrometer Pierre and his brother had invented to measure tiny electrical currents.

### Polonium and Radium

**Breakthrough Discovery (1898):**
Marie found that pitchblende (uranium ore) was far more radioactive than pure uranium—implying unknown elements were present. Pierre abandoned his own research to join her investigation.

Working in a converted shed with a leaky roof and poor ventilation (they couldn't afford better), the Curies processed tons of pitchblende:
- **July 1898**: Discovered **polonium** (named for Poland, Marie's oppressed homeland)
- **December 1898**: Discovered **radium** (from Latin "radius" = ray)

**The Grueling Work:**
To prove radium's existence, Marie needed to isolate it. This required processing eight tons of pitchblende residue to obtain one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride. The work was physically exhausting:
- Stirring boiling pitchblende in huge vats
- Moving heavy containers
- Breathing toxic fumes
- Working in freezing or sweltering conditions

Pierre handled the physics; Marie handled the chemistry. By 1902, Marie had isolated pure radium and determined its atomic weight: 226.

### Coining "Radioactivity"

Marie coined the term "radioactivity" to describe the spontaneous emission of radiation. She demonstrated it was an atomic property, not a molecular one—an insight pointing toward the atom's internal structure, contradicting the prevailing view of atoms as indivisible.

## First Nobel Prize (1903)

### Initial Exclusion

In 1903, the Nobel Committee nominated Henri Becquerel and Pierre Curie for the Physics Prize—**excluding Marie**. This was typical gender discrimination: her contributions were attributed to her husband.

A committee member (Swedish mathematician Magnus Gösta Mittag-Leffler) alerted Pierre to the slight. Pierre wrote to the committee:

> "If it is true that one is seriously thinking about me [for the Prize], I very much wish to be considered together with Madame Curie with respect to our research on radioactive bodies."

### Nobel Prize in Physics (1903)

The committee relented. Marie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, sharing it with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."

**Celebration and Challenges:**
The prize brought fame but little immediate benefit:
- Prize money (70,000 francs) provided financial relief
- Marie and Pierre were too ill (from radiation exposure) to attend the ceremony
- Media attention was overwhelming and sexist, focusing on Marie's appearance rather than her science
- Pierre was offered a professorship at Sorbonne; Marie was not (she was merely his assistant in the lab)

The Curies remained humble, refusing to patent the radium isolation process, believing scientific knowledge should be freely available.

## Tragedy and Triumph

### Pierre's Death (1906)

On April 19, 1906, Pierre was killed in a street accident: crossing Rue Dauphine in a rainstorm, he slipped and fell under a heavy horse-drawn wagon. The wheel crushed his skull, killing him instantly. He was 46.

Marie was devastated. Her diary entries reveal profound grief:
> "They filled the coffin and put flowers on it... They closed it and I could see nothing more... Pierre is sleeping his last sleep beneath the earth; it is the end of everything, everything, everything."

### First Female Professor at Sorbonne

The University of Paris offered Marie Pierre's professorship—making her the first female professor at the Sorbonne (founded 1257). Her first lecture, November 5, 1906, drew enormous crowds curious to see the famous widow.

She began precisely where Pierre's last lecture had ended, emphasizing continuity of their work. The audience was moved; it was a symbolic moment for women in academia.

### Second Nobel Prize (1911)

In 1911, Marie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry "in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."

She became the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences—a record unmatched until Linus Pauling (Chemistry 1954, Peace 1962).

**Scandal:**
The prize came during a painful scandal. Marie had begun a relationship with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre's who was unhappily married. When Langevin's wife discovered the affair, she leaked Marie and Paul's love letters to the press.

The French press savaged Marie with xenophobic and sexist attacks:
- "Foreign woman" stealing a Frenchman
- "Homewr

ecker" destroying a marriage
- Anti-Semitic slurs (Marie wasn't Jewish but was falsely accused)

Einstein wrote Marie a supportive letter:
> "If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply don't read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated."

Marie seriously considered leaving France but ultimately stayed. The controversy faded, though it left scars.

## World War I Service

### Mobile X-Ray Units

When World War I erupted in 1914, Marie immediately sought ways to help. She realized X-rays could locate bullets and shrapnel in wounded soldiers, but X-ray equipment was confined to city hospitals.

Marie designed mobile X-ray units—"petites Curies" ("little Curies")—installed in vehicles that could reach battlefield hospitals. She:
- Convinced wealthy women to donate cars
- Installed X-ray equipment and generators
- Trained 150 women as radiological assistants
- Personally drove to the front lines, often under fire

She also trained her 17-year-old daughter Irène as an X-ray operator. Together they performed over one million X-ray examinations, saving countless limbs and lives.

Marie never sought profit or recognition for this service, refusing all decorations.

## Later Life and Legacy

### Radium Institute

After the war, Marie devoted herself to raising funds for the Radium Institute (now Institut Curie) in Paris, dedicated to physics, chemistry, and medical research. She toured the United States twice (1921, 1929), where American women raised money to buy radium for her research.

President Warren Harding personally presented her with one gram of radium (worth $100,000) on behalf of American women.

### Radiation Illness

Years of radiation exposure without protection took their toll. Marie suffered from:
- Cataracts
- Chronic fatigue
- Burns on her hands (her notebooks remain too radioactive to handle safely even today)
- Damaged bone marrow

She likely understood the danger but continued working. Science came first.

### Death (1934)

Marie died on July 4, 1934, age 66, of aplastic anemia—bone marrow failure caused by radiation exposure. She was buried next to Pierre in Sceaux cemetery.

In 1995, she and Pierre were reinterred in the Panthéon in Paris, the resting place of France's greatest citizens. Marie became the first woman interred there on her own merits (other women had been buried there because of their husbands).

## Family Legacy

### Daughters

Marie raised two daughters who both achieved distinction:

**Irène Joliot-Curie** (1897-1956):
- Worked alongside Marie from youth
- Married Frédéric Joliot; together they discovered artificial radioactivity
- **Won Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1935)** with her husband
- Died of leukemia from radiation exposure, like her mother

**Ève Curie** (1904-2007):
- Chose career in arts and writing instead of science
- Wrote definitive biography of her mother: *Madame Curie* (1937)
- Worked as war correspondent in WWII
- Lived to 102, the only family member not to die of radiation-related illness

The Curie family holds the record for most Nobel Prizes: 5 total (Marie 2, Pierre 1, Irène 1, Frédéric 1).
