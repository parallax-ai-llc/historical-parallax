## Summary

Abraham Kuyper was a Dutch Reformed theologian, politician, and journalist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands. He developed the concept of 'sphere sovereignty' — that different areas of society have their own God-given authority. He founded the Free University of Amsterdam and the Anti-Revolutionary Party. His famous declaration 'There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ does not cry, Mine!' encapsulated his vision of comprehensive Christianity.
