## Summary

Robert James Lee Hawke was Australia's 23rd Prime Minister, serving from 1983 to 1991 and becoming the Labor Party's longest-serving prime minister. Born in Bordertown, South Australia, Hawke transformed from a charismatic Rhodes Scholar and beer-drinking record holder into a brilliant trade union leader before entering politics at age 50. He led Labor to a record four consecutive election victories and oversaw sweeping economic reforms that modernized Australia's economy, including floating the dollar, dismantling tariff protections, and establishing Medicare and compulsory superannuation. Known equally for his larrikin charm and reformist zeal, Hawke achieved the highest approval rating of any Australian prime minister at 75%, though his leadership ended in 1991 when his treasurer Paul Keating successfully challenged him for the party leadership.

## Early Life and Background

Robert James Lee Hawke was born on 9 December 1929 in Bordertown, South Australia, the second of two sons of Clement Hawke, a Congregational minister, and Ellie Lee, a schoolteacher, both of Cornish ancestry.[^1] The family's religious background would deeply influence young Bob, with his uncle Albert serving as a Congregational minister and his mother harboring ambitions for Bob to follow in their footsteps.[^2] However, tragedy would reshape the family when Bob's 18-year-old brother Neil died, prompting the Hawkes to move to Perth, Western Australia, where they settled in the suburb of West Leederville.[^3]

Hawke's own brush with death came at age 17 when he suffered a serious accident on his new Panther motorbike that required critical surgery. This near-death experience acted as a catalyst, driving him to make the most of his talents and opportunities.[^4] He attended West Leederville State School and Perth Modern School before enrolling at the University of Western Australia, where he became president of the University's Student Representative Council.[^5] In 1952, Hawke graduated with both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees, demonstrating the intellectual prowess that would characterize his career.[^6]

In 1953, Hawke was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford—an achievement that represented the pinnacle of academic distinction for Australian students.[^7] During his time at Oxford from 1953 to 1956, Hawke made headlines not just for his academic work but for an extraordinary feat that would become part of Australian folklore. In 1954, as a penalty known as a "sconce" for failing to wear his academic gown in the college dining hall, he drank 2.5 pints (approximately 1.4 litres) of beer from a traditional yard glass in 11 seconds, earning him an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.[^8] Hawke himself later acknowledged that "it endeared me to a large section of the Australian voting population that I had a world beer drinking record."[^9]

Abandoning his planned degree at Oxford, Hawke submitted a thesis on the history of wage-fixing in Australia and graduated with a Bachelor of Letters in 1955.[^10] He returned to Australia in 1956 and married Hazel Masterson at Perth Trinity Church that same year.[^11] The couple would have four children together: Susan (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959), Roslyn (born 1961), and Robert Jr, who tragically died in early infancy in 1963—a loss that would profoundly affect both Bob and Hazel.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Hawke's entry into the Australian labor movement began in 1956 when he accepted a scholarship to undertake doctoral studies in arbitration law at the Australian National University in Canberra.[^13] However, just a year later, he was recommended to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to become a research officer, replacing Harold Souter who had become ACTU Secretary.[^14] This marked the beginning of a remarkable union career that would span more than two decades.

In 1959, Hawke was appointed as an ACTU advocate, and his performance in the 1959 national wage case, which secured a fifteen-shilling increase for workers, was regarded as a personal triumph that established his reputation as a formidable negotiator.[^15] Over the following decade, Hawke attained such success and prominence in his role that in 1969, despite never having held elected office in a trade union, he was encouraged to run for the position of ACTU President.[^16] He won the election on a modernizing platform by the narrow margin of 399 to 350, with the support of the left of the union movement.[^17]

As ACTU President from 1969 to 1980, Hawke proved to be a brilliant trade union official, securing favorable settlements for workers before Australia's arbitration commissions.[^18] His public profile grew enormously during this period, making him one of the most recognizable figures in Australian public life. However, Hawke's personal life during these years was troubled by heavy drinking and womanizing. He was named Victorian Father of the Year in 1971—an honor his wife Hazel disputed due to his behavior.[^19] In 1963, following the death of his infant son, Hawke suffered from alcohol poisoning, and in 1979 he suffered a physical collapse that shocked him into action.[^20] He publicly announced his alcoholism in a television interview and made a concerted—and ultimately successful—effort to overcome it, demonstrating the personal resilience that would become a hallmark of his political career.[^21]

Hawke had joined the Labor Party in 1947 at age 18, and throughout his union career, there was widespread speculation about his political ambitions.[^22] On 18 October 1980, at the age of 50, he was elected to federal parliament as the Labor candidate for the seat of Wills, Victoria.[^23] His entry into parliament created enormous expectations, and just over two years later, with the Labor Party trailing badly in the polls under Bill Hayden's leadership, Hawke made his move. In February 1983, mere hours before Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser called a snap election, Hawke was elected leader of the Australian Labor Party.[^24] The dramatic timing proved fortuitous.

## Major Achievements

On 5 March 1983, Bob Hawke led Labor to a landslide victory, winning 75 seats in the Australian House of Representatives against the Liberal Party's 33 and the National Party's 17—a 24-seat swing that represented the largest defeat of a sitting government since 1949 and the greatest Labor win since 1943.[^25] Hawke became Prime Minister less than 30 days after assuming leadership of his party and barely three years after entering Parliament.[^26] This remarkable ascent was just the beginning of an unprecedented era of Labor dominance: Hawke would lead his party to victory in four consecutive elections (1983, 1984, 1987, and 1990), making him the most electorally successful prime minister in the history of the Labor Party.[^27]

The cornerstone of Hawke's economic strategy was the Prices and Incomes Accord, negotiated with the trade union movement in 1983.[^28] Drawing on his background as ACTU President, Hawke established this agreement whereby unions agreed to restrict their demands for wage increases, and in turn the government guaranteed to both minimize inflation and promote an increased social wage, including by establishing new social programs.[^29] The Accord was revisited six times during the Hawke government, each time in response to new economic developments, and the process led to a decrease in both inflation and unemployment through to 1990.[^30] The seventh and final revision would ultimately lead to the establishment of the enterprise bargaining system, though this was finalized shortly after Hawke left office in 1991.[^31]

Working closely with his Treasurer Paul Keating, Hawke launched a "National Economic Summit" one month after the 1983 election, which brought together business and industrial leaders with politicians and trade union leaders.[^32] The three-day summit led to a unanimous adoption of a national economic strategy, generating sufficient political capital for widespread reform to follow. On 12 December 1983, following recommendations from the Reserve Bank, Hawke made the decisive call to float the Australian dollar immediately rather than incrementally, transforming Australia's monetary policy overnight.[^33] The government also repealed rules that prohibited foreign-owned banks from operating in Australia, dismantled the protectionist tariff system, privatized several state sector industries, ended subsidization of loss-making industries, and sold off part of the state-owned Commonwealth Bank.[^34] From 1987 to 1989, the government extended general tariff reductions, and from 1990 to 1991 introduced the reduction of all tariffs to 5% and the phasing out of textile, clothing and motor vehicle protection.[^35]

In social policy, the Hawke government established Medicare in 1984, creating permanent universal health care in Australia after previous attempts by Labor had been dismantled.[^36] The government initiated superannuation pension schemes for all workers, beginning the introduction of occupational superannuation that would become a cornerstone of Australia's retirement income system.[^37] In 1984, Hawke's government enacted the landmark Sex Discrimination Act, which eliminated discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy, family responsibilities and sexual harassment within the workplace.[^38] The Act was the first piece of legislation worldwide to use the term "sexual harassment."[^39] The government also passed the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986, which built on the premise that merely prohibiting sex discrimination was insufficient to provide women and men equal access to employment opportunities.[^40]

On 19 April 1984, Hawke's government declared "Advance Australia Fair" as Australia's national anthem, replacing "God Save the Queen" and fulfilling a long-delayed decision from a 1977 plebiscite.[^41] The timing was partly driven by the upcoming Los Angeles Olympics, for which many Australians desired an authentically Australian anthem to play in medal ceremonies.[^42] In 1986, Hawke oversaw passage of the Australia Act, which eliminated the ability for the United Kingdom to legislate with effect in Australia and formally severed all remaining legal ties between Australia and the United Kingdom.[^43] On 2 March 1986, Queen Elizabeth II signed the Proclamation at Government House, Canberra, with Prime Minister Hawke present—a well-known republican overseeing this critical step in Australia's constitutional evolution.[^44]

The Hawke government achieved remarkable success in environmental conservation. In 1983, in one of his first acts as prime minister, Hawke declared that the proposed Franklin Dam in Tasmania "will not be built," using the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 to prohibit dam-related clearing, excavation and building.[^45] This decision followed a seismic campaign by environmental activists led by Bob Brown and became a watershed moment for Australia's environmental movement.[^46] Later, Hawke personally led the Australian delegation to secure changes to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, ultimately winning a guarantee that drilling for minerals within Antarctica would be totally prohibited until 2048 at the earliest—reversing the diplomatic momentum that had been building toward allowing mining on the frozen continent.[^47]

In foreign policy, Hawke's most significant achievement came in 1989 when he proposed a southeast Asian region-wide forum for leaders and economic ministers, which led to the creation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).[^48] The first APEC meeting took place in Canberra in November 1989 with twelve founding members.[^49] The initiative was launched with scant preparation or consultation with key regional leaders—Hawke was going to ask for forgiveness, not permission—but it proved transformative in developing closer ties between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.[^50]

Perhaps Hawke's most emotional and humanitarian moment came in June 1989, following the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. On 10 June, just six days after the massacre, Hawke delivered a tearful speech at a memorial service in Canberra, breaking down as he read a briefing describing how "foot soldiers went through the square bayoneting or shooting anybody who was still alive."[^51] Without consulting Cabinet, Hawke unilaterally announced that approximately 42,000 Chinese students studying in Australia would be granted permanent visas on humanitarian grounds.[^52] When told by officials after the announcement that "you cannot do that, prime minister," Hawke reportedly replied: "I just did. It is done."[^53] His decision sparked a global refugee movement, with other Western countries following Australia's lead.[^54]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his electoral success and reformist achievements, Hawke's prime ministership was not without significant controversies and failures. From the political left, critics charged that the Prices and Incomes Accord was a policy of class collaboration and corporatism that kept real wages stagnant, benefiting business interests at workers' expense.[^55] Right-wing critics, conversely, claimed the Accord reduced the flexibility of the wages system and represented an inappropriate level of union involvement in economic policy.[^56] Within the Labor Party itself, friction developed between Hawke and the grassroots membership, who were unhappy at what they viewed as his iconoclasm and willingness to cooperate with business interests, with the Socialist Left faction and figures like Barry Jones offering severe criticism of government decisions.[^57]

Hawke's close relationships with wealthy business figures drew considerable fire. Critics complained of the abandonment of Labor tradition and criticized Hawke's closeness to his "rich mates"—particularly mining magnate Peter Abeles and media baron Rupert Murdoch—along with his alleged subservience to the United States.[^58] This criticism intensified during the 1989 Australian pilots' strike, when Hawke received condemnation for his "confrontationalist style" in siding with the airlines.[^59] When pilots demanded a 30% pay increase in June 1989, Hawke declared he was preparing for "war" with the union and declared a national emergency, allowing Royal Australian Air Force planes and pilots and overseas aircraft to provide services.[^60] The government fast-tracked visas for hundreds of "scab pilots" from overseas and paid their wages in an attempt to break the union.[^61] The aggressive stance set important precedents for future industrial disputes, including the Howard government's approach during the 1998 waterfront dispute.[^62]

On social policy, Hawke's promise that by 1990 no child need be living in poverty went unfulfilled, illustrating significant failures despite successes on other fronts.[^63] While child poverty did fall dramatically under the Hawke-Keating government—from nearly 16% in 1985 to around 11% by 1995—the complete elimination Hawke had promised proved unattainable.[^64] 

The most damaging controversy of Hawke's prime ministership was the early 1990s recession. Although Hawke and Keating had publicly promised there would be no recession—or at worst a "soft landing"—Australia entered a severe recession in late 1990.[^65] In announcing the recession, Treasurer Keating memorably (and controversially) stated that it was a "recession Australia had to have."[^66] By April 1991, unemployment was nearing 10% and would eventually peak at 10.8% by late 1992, while GDP contracted and revenue collapsed.[^67] The recession resulted from the unwinding of the excesses of the 1980s, the international recession, and the high interest rates that the government had employed to slow the asset price boom of 1988-89.[^68] The economic downturn devastated Hawke's popularity and that of his government, contributing significantly to the deterioration of his political partnership with Keating.[^69]

Hawke's personal life also generated significant controversy throughout his career. He was a "champion womaniser and boozer, and an unpleasant drunk," with his widely admired charm and charisma accompanied by a volcanic temper, sometimes on display in his television appearances.[^70] His marriage to Hazel was strained by his infidelities and heavy drinking. The divorce in 1994 and his subsequent marriage to his longtime lover, biographer Blanche d'Alpuget in 1995, caused what his grandson David Dillon described as "an earthquake within the family."[^71] The divorce estranged Hawke from some of his children for a period, with Dillon stating: "When our grandparents split and Bob moved on with Blanche it really tore our family apart."[^72] Though the family eventually reconciled, Hawke formally apologized for the toll the divorce and remarriage took on his children and grandchildren.[^73]

## Personal Life

Bob Hawke married Hazel Masterson in 1956 at Perth Trinity Church, beginning a partnership that would last nearly four decades and see Hazel support him through his rise from union advocate to ACTU President to Prime Minister.[^74] The couple had four children: Susan (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959), Roslyn (born 1961), and Robert Jr, who died in early infancy in 1963.[^75] The death of their infant son had a profound impact on both Bob and Hazel; Bob suffered from alcohol poisoning following the tragedy, beginning a long struggle with alcoholism that would not be resolved until the late 1970s.[^76]

Throughout his life before entering politics, Hawke was a heavy drinker, and his behavior strained his marriage considerably. Hazel publicly disputed his being named Victorian Father of the Year in 1971 due to his heavy drinking and womanizing.[^77] Hawke's relationship with writer Blanche d'Alpuget began in 1970 when they first met in Jakarta, and they met again in 1976 when she interviewed him for a biography she was writing on Sir Richard Kirby.[^78] This meeting led to a long and sporadic love affair that lasted throughout the 1980s, even as Hawke served as Prime Minister with Hazel as his spouse in the official residence.[^79]

The biography that d'Alpuget wrote about Hawke in the early 1980s candidly addressed his personal struggles—his drinking, his womanizing, his temper—and is credited with helping rather than hurting his political career by presenting him as authentically flawed and human.[^80] Hawke had tried to separate from Hazel to marry d'Alpuget during the 1980s, but the attempt failed since neither party would agree to be the one to walk out of the marriage while he was Prime Minister.[^81] The couple finally divorced in 1994, three years after Hawke left office, and Bob married Blanche in 1995.[^82]

Despite the painful divorce, Bob and Hazel maintained a connection, particularly through their children. When Hazel was dying in 2013, their daughter Ros arranged for Bob's final visit to say farewell, saying: "In the week that Mum was dying I felt that there must be closure of some kind for her and Dad."[^83] Bob sang to Hazel as she died, a poignant moment that demonstrated the enduring emotional bond despite the years of infidelity and ultimate dissolution of their marriage.[^84]

Hawke's personality was marked by contradictions: brilliant yet larrikin, reform-minded yet pragmatic, emotionally expressive yet capable of ruthlessness. His larrikin streak was perhaps best exemplified by his memorable outburst after Australia's historic America's Cup sailing victory in 1983, when he declared that "any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum"—a statement that endeared him to ordinary Australians.[^85] Yet this same man could deliver emotionally raw speeches about Tiananmen Square, could negotiate complex economic reforms with business and union leaders, and could ruthlessly pursue policies that hurt traditional Labor constituencies when he believed them necessary for the national interest.

## Legacy

Bob Hawke died peacefully at his home on 16 May 2019 at age 89, just days before a federal election.[^86] His wife Blanche d'Alpuget announced: "Today we lost Bob Hawke, a great Australian—many would say the greatest Australian of the post-war era."[^87] Thousands of people gathered inside and outside the Sydney Opera House in June 2019 for his state memorial service, with scores of political leaders from both sides of politics packing the Concert Hall.[^88]

Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that Hawke "led and served our country with passion, courage, and an intellectual horsepower that made our country stronger" and that "he was true to his beliefs in the Labor tradition and defined the politics of his generation and beyond."[^89] Former Labor leader Bill Hayden described Hawke as the "Don Bradman of Australian politics."[^90] Members of the Chinese-Australian community paid special tribute, with many stating that "Bob Hawke decided my fate" in reference to his 1989 decision to grant asylum to Chinese students following Tiananmen Square.[^91]

The economic reforms pursued by the Hawke-Keating government have been claimed by numerous economic commentators and journalists to have been the basis for both the modernization and internationalization of the Australian economy.[^92] The reforms are credited with triggering an unprecedentedly long period of economic growth, with Australia's gross domestic product increasing every year for 30 years after 1991.[^93] Economic historians often cite the Hawke government as a "turning point" from a protectionist, agricultural model to a more globalized and services-oriented economy.[^94]

Beyond economics, Hawke's legacy includes the permanent establishment of Medicare, the introduction of compulsory superannuation that has created one of the world's largest pension systems, the Sex Discrimination Act and affirmative action legislation that advanced women's equality, the creation of APEC, and landmark environmental protections for the Franklin River and Antarctica.[^95] Without Hawke's leadership, Antarctica would likely be open to mining, Tasmania's iconic Franklin River would be flooded, and Queensland's Daintree rainforest would be a timber plantation.[^96]

Hawke holds the highest-ever approval rating for an Australian prime minister, reaching 75% approval in 1984—a record that still stands.[^97] He is frequently ranked within the upper tier of Australian prime ministers by historians, and in a 2010 survey of historians and political scientists, Hawke came second overall, just behind his hero, John Curtin.[^98] As Labor's longest-serving prime minister and the only Labor leader to win four consecutive federal elections, his electoral record remains unmatched within his party.[^99]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and political historians generally regard Hawke as one of Australia's most consequential prime ministers, with his economic reforms fundamentally reshaping the nation's trajectory. The University of New South Wales described him as both "our larrikin" and "our reformer," capturing the dual nature of his appeal and effectiveness.[^100] Economic historians point to the National Economic Summit of 1983 as a masterclass in consensus-building, bringing together previously antagonistic business, union, and political leaders to forge a shared economic vision.[^101] The Accord system, while criticized from both left and right, is credited with successfully balancing the competing demands of wage restraint, employment growth, and social welfare expansion during a critical period of economic transition.[^102]

The Hawke government's environmental achievements have earned particular praise. Environmental groups have called Hawke "a great champion of Australia's natural world," with the Australian Conservation Foundation noting that his decisions on the Franklin Dam and Antarctic mining protection required political courage and vision at a time when such positions were far from universally popular.[^103] His response to Tiananmen Square is viewed by many scholars as demonstrating moral leadership and humanitarian instincts, with survivors of the massacre crediting his decision with sparking a global refugee movement.[^104]

Hawke's ability to connect with ordinary Australians while implementing sophisticated policy reforms is seen as remarkable. His personal authenticity—including his willingness to publicly acknowledge his struggles with alcohol and his flaws—created a bond with voters that transcended traditional political divisions.[^105] Former colleagues and historians note that his background as ACTU President gave him unique credibility with the union movement, allowing him to implement economic reforms that would have been politically impossible for leaders without that history.[^106] The Hawke Centre at the University of Adelaide describes his legacy as encompassing "economic reform, social justice, environmental protection, and international engagement."[^107]

### Negative Views

Critics on the left have consistently argued that Hawke betrayed Labor principles by embracing neoliberal economic policies that benefited capital at the expense of workers. The World Socialist Web Site characterized Hawke as having presided over "the deregulation of the Australian economy and the dismantling of the gains workers had won in the post-war period."[^108] Socialist and left-wing critics contend that the Accord was a mechanism for suppressing wage growth and weakening union power, with real wages remaining stagnant even as corporate profits soared.[^109] They argue that privatizations, tariff reductions, and labor market deregulation set Australia on a path toward greater inequality and precarious employment.[^110]

Some historians and political scientists have questioned whether Hawke's economic reforms were truly necessary or whether alternative, less market-oriented approaches could have achieved similar growth with better distributional outcomes.[^111] The failure to eliminate child poverty despite his explicit promise is cited as evidence that the government's priorities favored business interests over vulnerable populations.[^112] The aggressive stance toward the pilots' union in 1989 is seen by labor historians as setting dangerous precedents that subsequent conservative governments exploited to weaken union power more broadly.[^113]

Hawke's personal behavior, particularly his treatment of his first wife Hazel, has drawn criticism even from sympathetic observers. While his public acknowledgment of alcoholism was seen as courageous, critics note that the womanizing and infidelity continued throughout his political career, causing significant pain to his family.[^114] Some commentators have suggested that the largely positive historical assessment of Hawke reflects a tendency to overlook personal failings in successful male politicians that would be judged more harshly in other contexts.[^115]

The early 1990s recession remains a significant blemish on Hawke's economic record, with critics arguing that excessively high interest rates were maintained too long due to Treasury and Reserve Bank rigidity.[^116] The infamous "recession we had to have" comment, though made by Keating, reflected a government that appeared callous toward the unemployed and struggling businesses.[^117] Some economists argue that with more flexible monetary policy, the severity of the recession could have been mitigated.[^118]

Finally, critics point to Hawke's close relationships with wealthy business figures like Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch as evidence of a prime minister too comfortable with concentrated economic power and too willing to accommodate corporate interests at the expense of ordinary workers and consumers.[^119] His alleged subservience to the United States in foreign policy matters is seen by some historians as limiting Australia's independence and contributing to an overly uncritical alliance relationship.[^120]
