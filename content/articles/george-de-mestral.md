## Summary

George de Mestral was a Swiss electrical engineer who invented Velcro after noticing how burrs stuck to his dog's fur during a walk in the Alps. Examining the burrs under a microscope, he saw tiny hooks that caught on loops of fabric, inspiring the hook-and-loop fastener. It took him over a decade to perfect the product. Velcro is now used in countless applications from clothing to space exploration.
