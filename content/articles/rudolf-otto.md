## Summary

Rudolf Otto was a German theologian and philosopher of religion who profoundly influenced the modern understanding of religious experience. His book The Idea of the Holy introduced the concept of the 'numinous' — the experience of the holy as mysterium tremendum et fascinans (fearful and fascinating mystery). He argued that this experience is the foundation of all religion and cannot be reduced to rational or moral categories.
