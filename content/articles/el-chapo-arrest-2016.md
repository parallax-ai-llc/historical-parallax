## Overview

Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán is the most notorious drug lord of the 21st century and the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Known for his short stature ("El Chapo" means Shorty) and brutal efficiency, he transformed the Sinaloa Cartel into the world's most powerful drug trafficking organization. He is equally famous for his Houdini-like ability to crack out of maximum-security prisons—twice. His final capture in 2016, following a controversial interview with actor Sean Penn, led to his extradition to the United States, where he is currently serving a sentence of life plus 30 years at ADX Florence, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies."

## Legacy

### Sinaloa Cartel

Did not collapse. Split into factions:
- **Los Chapitos:** Chapo's sons (Ivan, Jesus, Ovidio). More violent, flashy.
- **El Mayo:** Ismael Zambada (Chapo's partner, never caught... until 2024 surrender?).

### Violence

Mexico's drug war continues. 400,000+ dead since 2006.
