## Summary

Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972) was a Japanese novelist and short story writer who became the first Japanese author to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968. Known for his lyrical prose and exploration of Japanese aesthetics, particularly the concepts of *mono no aware* (pathos of things) and *yugen* (mysterious profundity), Kawabata created works that bridged traditional Japanese sensibilities with modernist literary techniques. His most celebrated novels include *Snow Country*, *Thousand Cranes*, and *The Sound of the Mountain*. His career spanned nearly five decades, during which he witnessed and depicted Japan's transformation from pre-war traditionalism through post-war modernization. His life ended tragically by suicide in 1972, leaving an indelible mark on world literature.

## Early Life and Background

Kawabata Yasunari was born on June 14, 1899, in Osaka, Japan, into a family of physicians. His early life was marked by profound loss and loneliness that would deeply influence his literary sensibility throughout his career[^1]. When he was only two years old, his father died of tuberculosis, followed by his mother's death the following year. This early experience of loss became a recurring theme in his writing, often exploring themes of loneliness, death, and the ephemeral nature of beauty[^2].

After his parents' deaths, Kawabata was raised by his grandfather in the countryside. His grandmother died when he was seven, and his only sister died when he was nine, leaving him alone with his aging, blind grandfather[^3]. This period of his life, living in rural Japan with an elderly relative, exposed him to traditional Japanese culture and aesthetics that would profoundly shape his literary vision. He later referred to himself as a "professional orphan," and the theme of orphanhood and solitude permeates much of his work[^4].

His grandfather died when Kawabata was fifteen, making him completely alone in the world. This succession of deaths during his formative years created what critics have called a "death complex" in his psyche, manifesting in his fiction's preoccupation with death, memory, and the transient nature of life[^5]. He kept a diary during his grandfather's final illness, documenting the old man's decline in clinical detail—an early indication of his observational powers and literary inclinations[^6].

Despite these hardships, Kawabata was an excellent student. He attended the prestigious First Higher School in Tokyo and subsequently enrolled at Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo), where he studied Japanese literature[^7]. At university, he became involved with literary circles and began publishing short stories. He graduated in 1924 with a thesis on the novelist Izumi Kyōka, whose aesthetic sensibilities influenced Kawabata's own developing style[^8].

During his university years, Kawabata co-founded the literary journal *Bungei Jidai* (The Artistic Age) with other young writers, establishing himself as part of the Neo-Sensualist school of Japanese literature[^9]. This movement emphasized sensory impressions and lyrical prose over conventional narrative structures, representing a modernist break from naturalist Japanese fiction that had dominated the previous decades[^10].

## Rise to Prominence

Kawabata's rise to literary prominence began in the 1920s when he emerged as a leading voice among Japan's modernist writers. His early works, including "The Izu Dancer" (1926), brought him critical acclaim and popular success[^11]. This semi-autobiographical novella, based on his own travels as a student, tells the story of a lonely young man who encounters a troupe of traveling entertainers. The work's delicate treatment of first love and its lyrical depiction of the Japanese landscape established many of the hallmarks of Kawabata's mature style[^12].

Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, Kawabata continued to publish prolifically in literary magazines and journals. His association with the Neo-Sensualist movement gave him a platform and intellectual community, though he would eventually move beyond the movement's strict aesthetics[^13]. During this period, he experimented with various modernist techniques, including stream-of-consciousness narration and fragmented narrative structures that reflected the influence of European modernism[^14].

Kawabata's reputation grew significantly with the serial publication of *Snow Country* (*Yukiguni*), which began appearing in journals in 1935 and continued sporadically until its completion in 1948[^15]. This novel, considered his masterpiece by many critics, tells the story of a Tokyo dilettante's affair with a provincial geisha in a remote hot spring town. The work's exquisite prose and its meditation on beauty, transience, and isolation established Kawabata as one of Japan's foremost literary artists[^16].

During World War II, Kawabata's career continued, though the period was complicated by the militarist government's control over cultural production. He served as president of the Japanese P.E.N. Club and was involved in the wartime literary establishment, a position that would later raise questions about his wartime conduct[^17]. Unlike some contemporaries who wrote explicit propaganda, Kawabata largely focused on aesthetic and apolitical subjects, though this itself represented a choice to avoid confronting the war's realities[^18].

In the post-war period, Kawabata's stature only increased. He published some of his most celebrated works during the late 1940s and 1950s, including *Thousand Cranes* (1949-1951) and *The Sound of the Mountain* (1949-1954)[^19]. These novels explored the psychological depths of their characters while maintaining Kawabata's characteristic attention to sensory detail and traditional aesthetics. His work was increasingly translated into English and other languages, bringing him international recognition[^20].

By the 1960s, Kawabata was widely regarded as Japan's greatest living writer. He had received virtually every major Japanese literary award and was frequently mentioned as a potential Nobel Prize candidate[^21]. His role as a cultural ambassador for Japanese literature grew, and he worked tirelessly to promote Japanese writers both domestically and internationally. He served again as president of the Japanese P.E.N. Club and was active in international literary organizations[^22].

## Major Achievements

Kawabata's most significant achievement came in 1968 when he became the first Japanese writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature[^23]. The Swedish Academy praised him "for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind"[^24]. In his Nobel acceptance speech, titled "Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself," Kawabata meditated on Zen Buddhism, traditional Japanese aesthetics, and the relationship between Japanese cultural traditions and modern literature[^25]. The speech itself became a significant document in cross-cultural understanding, though some critics found it romanticized traditional Japan while obscuring the nation's modern complexities[^26].

*Snow Country* stands as Kawabata's most celebrated novel internationally. The work's opening line—"The train came out of the long tunnel into the snow country"—is one of the most famous in Japanese literature[^27]. The novel's structure is deliberately elliptical, with gaps in time and causation that require readers to actively participate in creating meaning. Its depiction of the doomed relationship between Shimamura and the geisha Komako exemplifies Kawabata's ability to capture the aesthetic principle of *mono no aware*, the poignant awareness of the transience of all things[^28].

*Thousand Cranes* represents another major achievement, exploring themes of tradition, sexuality, and the weight of the past through the lens of the tea ceremony[^29]. The novel follows a young man entangled with his dead father's mistress and her daughter, with the ritualized world of tea ceremony serving as both setting and metaphor for the characters' emotional constraints. The work demonstrates Kawabata's ability to use traditional cultural practices not as mere exotic backdrop but as integral elements of psychological exploration[^30].

*The Sound of the Mountain* is often considered Kawabata's most psychologically penetrating novel. Following an aging businessman who finds himself attracted to his daughter-in-law while growing estranged from his own wife and children, the novel explores aging, memory, and unfulfilled desire with remarkable subtlety[^31]. The titular sound—a mysterious rumbling from the mountain that the protagonist hears at night—serves as a harbinger of death and a symbol of the unconscious forces that shape human lives[^32].

Beyond his novels, Kawabata made significant contributions to the short story form. Works like "The Moon on the Water," "The Grasshopper and the Bell Cricket," and "One Arm" showcase his ability to create complete aesthetic experiences in compressed narrative spaces[^33]. These stories often feature surreal or dreamlike elements, revealing the influence of Western modernism while maintaining distinctly Japanese sensibilities[^34].

Kawabata's literary criticism and essays also constitute an important achievement. His writings on Japanese aesthetics, particularly his explorations of *wabi* (rustic simplicity), *sabi* (aged elegance), and *yugen* (mysterious depth), helped introduce international audiences to Japanese aesthetic concepts[^35]. His criticism of contemporary Japanese writers provided important guidance to younger authors and helped shape the development of post-war Japanese literature[^36].

His role in promoting Japanese literature internationally cannot be overstated. Through his work with P.E.N. International and his personal relationships with translators and foreign writers, Kawabata helped create the conditions for the global recognition that Japanese literature enjoys today[^37]. His Nobel Prize opened doors for subsequent Japanese Nobel laureates Ōe Kenzaburō and Kazuo Ishiguro (who, though British, writes from a Japanese cultural perspective)[^38].

Kawabata also mentored younger writers, most notably Mishima Yukio, who became one of Japan's most internationally famous authors[^39]. Though their relationship was complex and eventually strained, Kawabata's early support was crucial to Mishima's career. He recognized Mishima's talent while the younger writer was still in his teens and worked to promote his early publications[^40].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his literary achievements, Kawabata's career and legacy have been subject to various controversies and criticisms. His wartime activities remain a source of debate among scholars. As president of the Japanese P.E.N. Club during World War II, Kawabata operated within the militarist government's cultural apparatus[^41]. While he did not write explicit propaganda like some contemporaries, his failure to oppose the war effort and his participation in government-sponsored literary activities have been criticized as a form of collaboration[^42].

Some scholars argue that Kawabata's aesthetic focus during wartime represented a deliberate choice to ignore the political realities around him, a form of escapism that was itself politically complicit[^43]. His post-war writings rarely addressed the war directly, leading critics to accuse him of avoiding moral reckoning with this period[^44]. This contrasts with writers like Ōe Kenzaburō, who explicitly confronted Japan's wartime atrocities and post-war responsibilities[^45].

Feminist critics have raised significant concerns about Kawabata's representation of women. Many of his works feature male protagonists who objectify women, viewing them primarily as aesthetic objects or sources of solace[^46]. In *Snow Country*, Komako exists largely as an object of Shimamura's contemplation rather than as a fully realized subject in her own right. Critics argue that this pattern reflects a broader tendency in Kawabata's work to depict women through a male gaze that reduces them to symbols of beauty or purity[^47].

The prevalence of young girls as objects of desire in Kawabata's fiction has also drawn criticism. *House of the Sleeping Beauties* (1961), which depicts an establishment where elderly men spend nights beside unconscious young women, has been particularly controversial[^48]. While defenders argue the work is a meditation on aging and mortality, critics see it as problematic in its sexualization of vulnerable young women[^49]. Similar concerns have been raised about stories like "One Arm," which features a young woman who literally loans her arm to an elderly man for a night[^50].

Some critics have questioned whether Kawabata's work, particularly as presented to Western audiences, reinforces Orientalist stereotypes of Japan as a land of exotic aesthetics and mysterious traditions[^51]. His Nobel acceptance speech's emphasis on Zen Buddhism and traditional aesthetics, while beautiful, may have contributed to a simplified view of Japanese culture that overlooks its modern complexities and diversities[^52]. This criticism suggests that Kawabata's international success partly depended on conforming to Western expectations of what Japanese literature should be[^53].

Literary critics have also debated the coherence and accessibility of Kawabata's narrative techniques. His elliptical style, with its gaps and ambiguities, has been praised for its sophistication but also criticized for its opacity[^54]. Some readers find his works frustratingly vague, with insufficient narrative development and character psychology. The fragmented nature of works like *Snow Country*, which was composed over many years, has been seen as both a strength and a weakness[^55].

Kawabata's relationship with Mishima Yukio became controversial, especially after Mishima's spectacular suicide by ritual disembowelment in 1970[^56]. Some observers suggested that Kawabata, as Mishima's mentor, bore some responsibility for not intervening in the younger writer's increasingly militant nationalism and self-destructive tendencies[^57]. Kawabata's own suicide in 1972, just over a year after Mishima's death, led to speculation about the connection between the two deaths, though no note was found to explain Kawabata's motivations[^58].

His political quietism has also been criticized. Unlike many intellectuals of his generation, Kawabata rarely took public stances on political issues, neither during the militarist period nor during the post-war American occupation and beyond[^59]. This apolitical stance, while allowing him to focus on aesthetic matters, has been seen by some as a failure of intellectual responsibility, particularly given his prominence and influence[^60].

---

## Personal Life

Kawabata's personal life was marked by the loneliness that had defined his childhood. In 1926, he married Hideko Matsubayashi, the daughter of a textile merchant[^61]. The marriage appears to have been stable but not particularly passionate, and Kawabata's fiction often explores relationships characterized by emotional distance and unfulfilled longing rather than intimacy[^62]. The couple had no biological children, though they adopted a daughter in later years[^63].

Throughout his life, Kawabata struggled with insomnia and various health issues, both physical and psychological[^64]. He frequently stayed at hot spring resorts, ostensibly for health reasons, though these trips also provided material for his fiction and solitude for writing. The remote inns and geisha districts that feature prominently in his works were drawn from these personal experiences[^65].

Kawabata maintained complex relationships with several geisha over the years, though the exact nature of these relationships remains somewhat mysterious[^66]. These connections provided him with insight into the world of traditional entertainment and the lives of women in these professions, but they also raise questions about power dynamics and the economic dimensions of such relationships[^67]. His fiction's sympathetic but ultimately objectifying portrayal of geisha may reflect the complexities of these personal relationships[^68].

His friendship with Mishima Yukio was one of the most significant relationships of his later life. The two writers, despite their age difference and stylistic differences, formed a close bond[^69]. Kawabata championed Mishima's work and helped promote his international reputation. However, their relationship became strained in Mishima's final years as the younger writer became increasingly involved with right-wing politics and his private militia[^70]. Kawabata was deeply affected by Mishima's dramatic suicide in 1970, and some believe this event contributed to his own suicide two years later[^71].

Colleagues and friends described Kawabata as a quiet, reserved man who was nonetheless capable of warmth in small circles[^72]. He was known for his meticulous attention to his prose, often revising works extensively even after publication. This perfectionism extended to his personal habits; he was reportedly fastidious about his appearance and surroundings[^73].

Kawabata was deeply interested in traditional Japanese arts, particularly the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, and calligraphy. These interests were not merely aesthetic but reflected a genuine engagement with the philosophical and spiritual dimensions of these practices[^74]. His collection of tea ceremony implements and his knowledge of the art form informed works like *Thousand Cranes*[^75].

Despite his international fame, Kawabata remained somewhat uncomfortable with public attention. He was known to be a reluctant public speaker, and his speeches, including his Nobel address, were typically brief and carefully composed[^76]. This reticence extended to personal revelation; unlike many modern authors, Kawabata kept his private life largely separate from his public persona[^77].

His relationship with alcohol was complex. He drank regularly, and alcohol features prominently in his fiction, but whether this constituted a dependence or was simply part of his social and creative routines remains debated[^78]. Some biographers have suggested that drinking was one of several methods he used to cope with chronic depression and insomnia[^79].

Kawabata's suicide on April 16, 1972, shocked Japan and the literary world. He was found with a gas hose in his mouth in his apartment in Zushi, near Tokyo[^80]. No suicide note was discovered, leaving the reasons for his death a subject of speculation. Various theories have been proposed: depression over Mishima's death, declining health, fear of losing his creative powers, or perhaps a philosophical decision consistent with his lifelong preoccupation with death and beauty[^81].

## Legacy

Kawabata's legacy as the first Japanese Nobel laureate in literature remains profound, establishing him as a bridge between Japanese and world literature[^82]. His Nobel Prize fundamentally changed the international perception of Japanese literature, demonstrating that works deeply rooted in specific cultural traditions could achieve universal resonance[^83]. The prize opened doors for greater translation and recognition of Japanese writers globally, contributing to the flourishing of Japanese literature in translation that continues today[^84].

His influence on subsequent generations of Japanese writers is immeasurable. Authors like Murakami Haruki, while stylistically quite different, have acknowledged Kawabata's importance in establishing Japanese literature's international viability[^85]. His exploration of loneliness, alienation, and the search for beauty in a changing world resonates with contemporary Japanese writers grappling with modernity's discontents[^86].

In the English-speaking world, Kawabata's works introduced readers to aesthetic concepts and narrative techniques that challenged Western literary assumptions. His elliptical style and emphasis on mood over plot influenced writers experimenting with non-linear narratives and impressionistic prose[^87]. Translators like Edward G. Seidensticker, who translated several of Kawabata's major works, helped establish conventions for translating Japanese literature that balanced fidelity to the original with accessibility to English readers[^88].

Kawabata's emphasis on traditional Japanese aesthetics has had a lasting impact on how Japanese culture is understood internationally. His writings on *mono no aware*, *wabi-sabi*, and other aesthetic concepts have been widely cited in discussions of Japanese culture, art, and design[^89]. While this has sometimes led to oversimplified or essentialized views of Japanese culture, it has also fostered genuine cross-cultural appreciation and understanding[^90].

In Japan, Kawabata holds a complex position in the cultural memory. He is revered as a literary master whose elegant prose exemplifies the Japanese language's aesthetic possibilities[^91]. His works remain staples of Japanese literature curricula, and his major novels continue to be widely read. However, critical perspectives on his wartime activities and treatment of women have complicated his legacy, leading to more nuanced assessments of his work[^92].

The Kawabata Yasunari Memorial Museum in Kamakura preserves his manuscripts, personal effects, and art collection, serving as a site of literary pilgrimage[^93]. The museum's existence testifies to his enduring importance in Japanese cultural life, while its exhibitions engage with both his achievements and the controversies surrounding his work[^94].

Film and television adaptations of Kawabata's works have extended his influence beyond literature. Notable adaptations include Naruse Mikio's *Floating Clouds* and several versions of *Snow Country*, which have introduced his stories to audiences who might not engage with the original texts[^95]. These adaptations have sometimes taken liberties with the source material, sparking debates about fidelity and interpretation[^96].

Academic scholarship on Kawabata continues to flourish, with new critical approaches yielding fresh insights into his work. Feminist criticism, postcolonial theory, and trauma studies have all been applied to his oeuvre, revealing previously unexamined dimensions[^97]. Comparative studies have explored his relationship to Western modernism, showing how he adapted techniques from Joyce, Proust, and others while maintaining distinctly Japanese sensibilities[^98].

The question of Kawabata's relevance to contemporary readers remains actively debated. Some argue that his aesthetic focus and traditional sensibilities make him less relevant to modern concerns than more explicitly political writers[^99]. Others contend that his exploration of loneliness, disconnection, and the search for meaning in beauty speaks directly to contemporary experiences of alienation and environmental crisis[^100].

His suicide has itself become part of his legacy, interpreted variously as a tragic end to a melancholic life, an aesthetic statement consistent with Japanese cultural traditions, or a failure of psychological support systems[^101]. The lack of a suicide note has allowed for multiple interpretations, each reflecting different understandings of Kawabata's life and work[^102].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Kawabata celebrate him as a master stylist whose prose achieves an almost musical quality in its attention to rhythm, image, and sensory detail[^103]. Literary scholars have praised his ability to render complex emotional states through subtle observations of the natural world and human gestures, creating what critic Donald Keene called "a literature of nuance"[^104]. His influence on establishing a distinctly modern Japanese literary voice that nonetheless remained connected to traditional aesthetics is seen as a major achievement[^105].

Supporters argue that Kawabata's focus on beauty and aesthetics represents not escapism but a profound engagement with fundamental human needs. In a century marked by unprecedented violence and destruction, his insistence on the importance of aesthetic experience can be read as an affirmation of human dignity and the sustaining power of art[^106]. Scholar Gwenn Boardman Petersen argues that Kawabata's work "offers a vision of beauty as a mode of resistance to the forces of dissolution and despair"[^107].

Defenders of Kawabata's wartime conduct note that he never wrote explicit propaganda and that his aesthetic focus preserved a space for non-militaristic values during a period of intense nationalism[^108]. They point out that his position in the literary establishment allowed him to protect some writers from harsher treatment, even if he could not openly oppose the regime[^109]. This view sees Kawabata's wartime role as a form of quiet resistance rather than collaboration[^110].

Regarding gender representation, some scholars argue that Kawabata's male protagonists' objectification of women is presented critically, not endorsingly. They contend that works like *Snow Country* actually reveal the poverty of the male gaze, showing how Shimamura's aestheticizing view of Komako prevents genuine connection[^111]. From this perspective, Kawabata's fiction explores and critiques rather than simply reproduces problematic gender dynamics[^112].

Literary critics have praised Kawabata's narrative innovations, particularly his use of fragmentation and ellipsis to create spaces for reader imagination and interpretation[^113]. His technique of composing longer works through accumulation of shorter sections, each complete in itself, has been seen as anticipating postmodern literary strategies[^114]. Scholar Roy Starrs argues that Kawabata's "gaps and silences are as eloquent as his words, creating a literature of suggestion rather than statement"[^115].

Kawabata's role as a cultural ambassador has been viewed positively by those who see him as fostering international understanding. His Nobel Prize and his efforts to promote Japanese literature abroad helped create a foundation for greater cross-cultural literary exchange[^116]. His willingness to explain Japanese aesthetic concepts to foreign audiences, while risking oversimplification, made these traditions accessible to readers who might otherwise never encounter them[^117].

Psychologically-oriented critics have found great depth in Kawabata's exploration of loneliness, loss, and the human need for connection. His fiction's recurrent themes of orphanhood and isolation reflect his personal traumas but transcend autobiography to speak to universal human experiences[^118]. Scholar Makoto Ueda writes that "Kawabata's work plumbs the depths of loneliness with a compassion that transforms solitude from mere pathos into a condition of profound human significance"[^119].

His short stories are particularly praised for their technical perfection and their ability to create complete aesthetic experiences in compressed spaces. Works like "The Grasshopper and the Bell Cricket" are taught worldwide as exemplars of the short story form[^120]. These stories demonstrate Kawabata's ability to find moments of transcendent beauty in ordinary life, a skill that has inspired countless writers[^121].

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Kawabata's aestheticism represents a problematic withdrawal from political and social responsibility. Literary scholar Janet Walker contends that his refusal to engage with Japan's militarism and imperialism constituted a "failure of intellectual courage" that allowed him to benefit from a system he refused to critique[^122]. This view sees his wartime aesthetic focus as complicity through silence[^123].

Feminist scholars have leveled sustained criticism at Kawabata's representation of women. Susan J. Napier argues that his female characters "exist primarily as mirrors for male consciousness, aesthetic objects rather than subjects with their own interiority and agency"[^124]. Works like *House of the Sleeping Beauties* are seen not as meditations on mortality but as disturbing fantasies of male power over unconscious women[^125]. This pattern of objectification is viewed as reflecting and reinforcing patriarchal attitudes[^126].

Postcolonial critics have questioned whether Kawabata's international success depended on conforming to Orientalist expectations of Japanese exoticism. Scholar Atsuko Sakaki argues that "Kawabata's Nobel Prize validated a particular vision of Japan as timeless, aesthetic, and mysterious that obscured the nation's modern, industrial, and imperial realities"[^127]. From this perspective, his role as cultural ambassador reinforced rather than challenged Western stereotypes[^128].

Some literary critics find Kawabata's narrative techniques frustratingly vague and insufficiently developed. The elliptical quality praised by admirers is seen by detractors as a failure to fully realize characters and situations[^129]. Critic Hisaaki Yamanouchi writes that Kawabata's works "often seem like collections of beautiful sentences rather than fully integrated narratives," suggesting that his prose style sometimes overwhelms narrative coherence[^130].

The question of Kawabata's influence on Mishima Yukio's radicalization and suicide has led some to criticize his mentorship. Critics argue that Kawabata failed to intervene as Mishima became increasingly extreme in his nationalism and militarism[^131]. While Kawabata cannot be held directly responsible for Mishima's choices, some believe his failure to publicly distance himself from Mishima's politics represented a moral failure[^132].

Kawabata's own suicide has been criticized by some as a self-indulgent act that romanticized death rather than confronting life's difficulties. This view, while less common, suggests that his suicide represented a failure to fulfill his responsibilities to family, readers, and younger writers who looked to him for guidance[^133]. The absence of a note explaining his reasons has been interpreted as a final evasion of communication and responsibility[^134].

Critics of Kawabata's Nobel acceptance speech argue that it presented a sanitized and traditionalist view of Japanese culture that ignored the nation's modern complexities. Scholar Rebecca Copeland writes that the speech "performed a Japan that existed more in nostalgic imagination than in post-war reality," reinforcing Western stereotypes rather than presenting a more complex cultural portrait[^135].

Some contemporary Japanese writers and critics view Kawabata's style and themes as outdated, representing a pre-war sensibility that has little relevance to contemporary Japan. This view sees him as a period figure whose importance is primarily historical rather than continuing[^136]. The declining readership of his works among younger Japanese readers is sometimes cited as evidence of this diminishing relevance[^137].

The psychological interpretation of Kawabata's work has also been questioned. Some critics argue that reading his fiction primarily through the lens of his childhood traumas reduces complex literary works to symptoms of personal pathology[^138]. This approach, they contend, diminishes the artistic achievement of his work by over-emphasizing biographical explanation[^139].

Finally, critics have noted that Kawabata's influence may have had negative effects on Japanese literature by establishing templates that subsequent writers felt pressured to follow. The expectation that Japanese literature should emphasize traditional aesthetics and cultural uniqueness may have constrained writers seeking to explore more universal or experimental approaches[^140].
