## Summary

Martha Chase, with Alfred Hershey, conducted the pivotal 1952 Hershey-Chase experiment that confirmed DNA as the carrier of genetic information. Using radioactive isotopes to label DNA and protein separately, they proved that phage DNA, not protein, entered bacteria during infection. Despite the experiment's significance, Chase received limited recognition during her lifetime.
