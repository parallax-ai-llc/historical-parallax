## Summary

Felix Klein was a German mathematician known for his work in group theory, function theory, and non-Euclidean geometry. His 'Erlangen Program' unified different geometries by classifying them according to their symmetry groups, revolutionizing the understanding of geometry. He popularized the Klein bottle, a non-orientable surface. Klein also made lasting contributions to mathematics education.
