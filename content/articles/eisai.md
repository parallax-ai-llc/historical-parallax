## Summary

Eisai was a Japanese Buddhist monk who founded the Rinzai Zen school in Japan. He studied Chan Buddhism in China and brought both Zen practice and tea cultivation back to Japan. His work Kissa Yojoki (Drinking Tea for Health) introduced tea culture to Japan. He is thus credited as the father of both Rinzai Zen and the Japanese tea tradition.
