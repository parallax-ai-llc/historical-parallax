## Summary

Mahakasyapa was one of the principal disciples of the Buddha and the leader of the Sangha after the Buddha's death. He presided over the First Buddhist Council at Rajagriha, where the Buddhist scriptures were first compiled. In Zen Buddhism, he is considered the first patriarch, receiving the direct mind-to-mind transmission from the Buddha (the 'Flower Sermon'). He was known for his strict ascetic practices.
