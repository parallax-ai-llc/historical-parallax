## Summary

Rumi was a 13th-century Persian Sufi mystic and poet whose Masnavi is considered one of the greatest works of mystical literature. His encounter with the wandering dervish Shams-i-Tabrizi transformed him from a conventional scholar into an ecstatic mystic poet. He founded the Mevlevi Order, known for the whirling dervishes. He is the best-selling poet in the United States and one of the most widely read poets in the world.
