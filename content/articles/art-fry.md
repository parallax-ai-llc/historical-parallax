## Summary

Art Fry co-invented Post-it Notes at 3M by applying Spencer Silver's low-tack adhesive to paper bookmarks. He conceived the idea in 1974 when his bookmarks kept falling out of his choir hymnal. Post-it Notes became one of the most ubiquitous office products in the world, with billions sold annually.
