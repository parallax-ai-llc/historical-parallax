## Summary

The Sharpeville Massacre of March 21, 1960, was a turning point in South African history and the global anti-apartheid struggle. On that day, South African police opened fire on a crowd of unarmed Black protesters who had gathered peacefully outside the Sharpeville police station to demonstrate against the apartheid regime's hated pass laws. At least 69 people were killed and over 180 wounded—many shot in the back as they fled.[^1]

The massacre shocked the world and transformed the nature of anti-apartheid resistance. Within weeks, the government declared a state of emergency, detained thousands, and banned the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC)—the organizations that had led peaceful resistance for decades. The government's violent response convinced many Black South Africans, including Nelson Mandela, that non-violent protest alone could never defeat apartheid.[^2]

Internationally, Sharpeville galvanized opposition to South Africa's white minority government. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 134 condemning the killings, marking the beginning of South Africa's diplomatic isolation. March 21 is now commemorated globally as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination—a permanent reminder that the struggle against racism carries a human cost.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Apartheid System

Apartheid (Afrikaans for "apartness" or "separateness") was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination enforced by South Africa's National Party government from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the white minority (about 15% of the population) controlled all political and economic power while the Black majority (about 75%) was stripped of citizenship and basic rights.[^4]

Key elements of apartheid included:

- **Racial Classification:** All South Africans were classified by race (White, Black/African, Coloured, Indian)
- **Geographic Separation:** Black South Africans were confined to designated "homelands" (Bantustans) and townships
- **Political Exclusion:** Black people had no vote in national affairs
- **Economic Exploitation:** Black labor was extracted for white-owned mines, farms, and industries at minimal wages[^5]

### The Pass Laws

The "pass laws" (or "dompas" system) were a cornerstone of apartheid control. Every Black South African over 16 was required to carry a "reference book" (passbook) containing:

- Personal identification and photograph
- Employment records
- Tax receipts
- Fingerprints
- Permission stamps for movement between areas

Failure to produce a valid pass on demand was grounds for immediate arrest and imprisonment. Millions of Black South Africans were arrested under the pass laws, which controlled where they could live, work, and travel. The pass symbolized the daily humiliation of apartheid.[^6]

### The Birth of the PAC

The Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) was formed in April 1959 by Robert Sobukwe and other members who broke from the African National Congress (ANC). The PAC represented a more militant, Africanist ideology that:

- Rejected the ANC's multiracial approach
- Emphasized African self-reliance
- Called for more aggressive direct action
- Sought to mobilize the Black masses with simple, dramatic campaigns[^7]

The anti-pass campaign was designed as the PAC's first major national action.

## The Protest

### The PAC's Campaign

In early 1960, the PAC announced a nationwide campaign against the pass laws, to begin on March 21. The strategy was simple and non-violent:

- Participants would leave their passbooks at home
- They would present themselves at police stations for arrest
- Mass arrests would overwhelm the judicial system
- The campaign would continue until the pass laws were abolished[^8]

PAC President Robert Sobukwe personally led the campaign, presenting himself for arrest in Johannesburg that morning. Similar protests occurred across the country.

### Sharpeville, March 21, 1960

Sharpeville was a Black township near Vereeniging, about 50 kilometers south of Johannesburg, in what was then the Transvaal province. On the morning of March 21, crowds began gathering near the Sharpeville police station in response to the PAC's call.

**The Gathering:**
- Estimates of crowd size range from 5,000 to 20,000 people
- The atmosphere was initially peaceful, even festive
- Protesters were unarmed
- Some participants treated it as a festival; women and children were present
- Low-flying jets attempted to disperse the crowd without success[^9]

**The Police Response:**
By early afternoon, approximately 300 police officers had assembled, some in armored vehicles called "Saracens." As the crowd pressed against the fence surrounding the police station, tension rose.

### The Shooting

At approximately 1:15 PM, without warning or order to disperse, police opened fire on the crowd. The shooting lasted between 40 seconds and two minutes.

**Witnesses reported:**
- No warning was given before the shooting
- Automatic weapons were used
- The crowd panicked and fled
- Police continued firing at fleeing protesters
- Many victims were shot in the back[^10]

The killing only stopped when officers ran out of ammunition.

## Death Toll and Casualties

**Official Government Figures:**
- 69 killed
- 180 wounded[^11]

**Later Research:**
- At least 91 killed (possibly higher)
- Over 238 wounded
- 52 victims were shot in the back
- 8 were women
- 10 were children[^12]

**Notable Victims:**
- The dead included workers, women returning from shopping, and children
- Many were not actively protesting but happened to be in the area

The death toll may never be precisely known, as some wounded fled fearing arrest, and families sometimes buried victims privately to avoid government scrutiny.

## Immediate Aftermath

### Domestic Response

**Public Reaction:**
- News of the massacre spread rapidly
- Demonstrations, strikes, and riots erupted across South Africa
- On March 28, massive work stayaways protested the killings
- ANC leader Albert Luthuli publicly burned his passbook; others followed[^13]

**Government Response:**
- March 30: State of emergency declared
- An estimated 18,000 people detained without trial
- April 8: ANC and PAC banned under the Unlawful Organizations Act
- Pass laws temporarily suspended (but later reinstated)
- Media censorship imposed[^14]

### International Response

**United Nations:**
- April 1, 1960: UN Security Council passed Resolution 134, condemning the massacre and calling on South Africa to abandon apartheid—the first Security Council resolution against the apartheid government[^15]

**Commonwealth:**
- March 1961: Under international pressure, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations[^16]

**Global Condemnation:**
- Widespread protests at South African embassies worldwide
- Calls for economic sanctions intensified
- The massacre connected the South African struggle to the American civil rights movement[^17]

## Shift to Armed Struggle

The Sharpeville Massacre fundamentally changed the anti-apartheid movement's approach. For decades, the ANC under leaders like Albert Luthuli had pursued non-violent resistance. After Sharpeville:

**Formation of Armed Wings:**
- **Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK)** ("Spear of the Nation"): Founded December 1961 as the armed wing of the ANC, with Nelson Mandela as its first commander
- **Poqo**: PAC's armed wing, also formed in the early 1960s[^18]

**Rationale:**
As Mandela later explained: "It would be unrealistic and wrong for African leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the government met our peaceful demands with force."[^19]

The decision to take up arms marked a new phase that would last until the 1990s negotiated transition to democracy.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views (Anti-Apartheid Perspective)

**Catalyst for Change:** Sharpeville exposed the violence underlying apartheid to the world. The massacre accelerated international isolation of the South African regime and built the global anti-apartheid movement that would eventually help bring down the system.[^20]

**Heroic Sacrifice:** The protesters at Sharpeville, armed only with their dignity, confronted a brutal system at the cost of their lives. Their sacrifice is honored in South Africa's constitution and democratic institutions.[^21]

**Symbol of Resistance:** Sharpeville became a global symbol of the fight against racist oppression, inspiring solidarity movements worldwide and connecting to struggles for civil rights in the United States and decolonization across Africa.[^22]

### Alternative Views (Apartheid-Era Government Perspective)

**Official Justification (1960):**
- Claimed police acted in self-defense against a violent mob
- Alleged protesters were armed and threatening
- Commission of inquiry (the Wessels Commission) largely exonerated police
- No officers were prosecuted[^23]

This narrative has been thoroughly discredited by historical evidence and survivors' testimony.

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Human Rights Day

March 21 is now a public holiday in South Africa—Human Rights Day—commemorating the Sharpeville victims and all who suffered under apartheid. Ceremonies are held at the Sharpeville Human Rights Precinct, which includes:
- Mass graves of victims
- A human rights memorial
- A museum documenting the massacre and apartheid[^24]

### International Commemoration

In 1966, the United Nations declared March 21 as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, making Sharpeville's legacy a permanent part of the global human rights calendar.[^25]

### Truth and Reconciliation

During South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (1996-1998), survivors and victims' families testified about the massacre. Some police applied for and received amnesty; others acknowledged their role. The process helped document the truth, though many families felt full justice was never achieved.[^26]

### Impact on Sports

The massacre contributed to South Africa's expulsion from international sports:
- 1964: Banned from the Olympics
- Similar bans in cricket, rugby, and other sports
- Sports isolation lasted until the early 1990s[^27]
