## Summary

Friedrich Schleiermacher was a German theologian and philosopher known as the 'Father of Modern Liberal Theology.' His work On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers redefined religion as a feeling of absolute dependence on the infinite. His magnum opus The Christian Faith systematized Protestant theology in a new way. He also pioneered modern hermeneutics as a general theory of interpretation.
