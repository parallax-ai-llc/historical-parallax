## Summary

Kamihara Hideo is a Japanese physicist who discovered iron-based superconductors in 2008, the first new class of high-temperature superconductors since the cuprate superconductors discovered in 1986. His discovery of superconductivity in LaOFeAs opened a new field of condensed matter physics research worldwide.
