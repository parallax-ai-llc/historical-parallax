## Summary

Imam al-Tirmidhi was a Persian Islamic scholar who compiled Jami al-Tirmidhi (also known as Sunan al-Tirmidhi), one of the six canonical hadith collections in Sunni Islam. His collection is unique for including both legal and non-legal hadith and for providing detailed assessments of each hadith's authenticity. He categorized hadith into sahih (authentic), hasan (good), and da'if (weak), a classification system adopted by later scholars.
