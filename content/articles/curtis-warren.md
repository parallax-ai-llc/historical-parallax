## Summary
Curtis Francis Warren is a British drug trafficker who was once listed by the Sunday Times as Britain's richest criminal. He was described as 'the richest and most successful British criminal who has ever been caught.' He has been convicted multiple times for drug trafficking across Europe.

## Early Life
