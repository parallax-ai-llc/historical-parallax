## Summary

Abu Dawud al-Sijistani was a Persian Islamic scholar who compiled the Sunan Abu Dawud, one of the six canonical hadith collections in Sunni Islam. He selected approximately 4,800 hadith from half a million he examined, focusing particularly on hadith relevant to Islamic law (fiqh). His collection is especially valued for its legal content and his critical evaluation of the narrators. He spent 20 years traveling to collect hadith.
