## Overview

On November 4, 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated at a peace rally in Tel Aviv. Yigal Amir, a right-wing Israeli law student who opposed the Oslo Accords with the Palestinians, shot Rabin twice in the back as he left the stage. Rabin died in surgery approximately an hour later. The assassination of a sitting Israeli leader by a fellow Jew traumatized Israel and derailed the peace process that Rabin had championed.
