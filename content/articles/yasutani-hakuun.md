## Summary

Yasutani Hakuun was a Japanese Zen master who was influential in bringing Zen to the West through his students, including Philip Kapleau and Robert Aitken. He founded the Sanbo Zen lineage that combined elements of both Soto and Rinzai Zen. His commentary on the koan Mu, recorded in Kapleau's The Three Pillars of Zen, introduced countless Westerners to Zen practice. His wartime support for Japanese militarism has been a source of controversy.
