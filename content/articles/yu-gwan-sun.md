## Summary

Yu Gwan-sun (December 16, 1902 – September 28, 1920) was a Korean independence activist who became one of the most iconic symbols of Korea's resistance against Japanese colonial rule. A student at Ewha Haktang in Seoul, she organized the Aunae Marketplace demonstration on April 1, 1919, as part of the March 1st Movement, where approximately 3,000 people gathered to demand Korean independence. After Japanese military police fired upon the peaceful protesters, killing 19 people including both her parents, Yu was arrested and sentenced to prison. Despite brutal torture at Seodaemun Prison, she refused to renounce her activism and continued organizing protests even from her cell until her death at age 17 from injuries sustained during torture. Known as "Korea's Joan of Arc," she was posthumously awarded the Order of Independence Merit and remains one of the most celebrated figures in Korean history.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Yu Gwan-sun was born on December 16, 1902, near Cheonan in South Chungcheong Province in the Korean Empire, during a period when Korea faced increasing pressure from Japanese imperialism.[^4] She was the second daughter among five children born to Yu Jung-kwon and Lee So-je, a devout Protestant family of the Goheung Ryu clan.[^5] Her family's religious environment profoundly shaped her early development, as both her grandfather Ryu Yoon-gi and uncle Ryu Joong-moo were committed Protestants who established a strong Christian foundation in the household.[^6]

Growing up in Jiryeongri, Edongmyeon, Mokcheongun in South Chungcheong province, Yu attended the nearby Maebong Presbyterian Church with her family.[^7] Her father, Yu Jung-kwon, had joined the Methodist Church at an early age and was actively involved in education and community work, instilling in his daughter both Christian values and traditional Confucian principles of nationalism and civic awareness.[^8] This combination of religious faith and patriotic consciousness would prove instrumental in shaping Yu's character and future activism.

From an early age, Yu demonstrated exceptional intelligence and remarkable memory. She could memorize Bible passages after hearing them only once, a talent that impressed both her family and church community.[^9] Beyond her intellectual gifts, Yu displayed strong moral character. She could not tolerate immoral actions and showed deep compassion for underprivileged people in her community, often helping those in need.[^10] Her family's commitment to the independence cause was extraordinary: nine members of the Yu family spanning three generations would eventually participate in the Korean independence movement, creating a legacy of resistance that transcended individual sacrifice.[^11]

Recognizing the young girl's exceptional abilities, American missionary Alice J. Hammond Sharp encouraged Yu to pursue formal education at the Ewha Hakdang Mission School for Girls in Seoul, approximately 90 kilometers from Cheonan.[^12] At a time when few Korean women had access to higher education, this opportunity represented a profound privilege and responsibility. Yu entered Ewha School in 1915, beginning in the middle school program through a scholarship that required recipients to work as teachers after graduation.[^13] In 1918, she graduated from middle school and began high school studies at what would later become Ewha Womans University, one of Korea's most prestigious institutions.[^14]

The mission education at Ewha, founded in 1886 by Methodist missionary Mary F. Scranton, aimed "to make Korean girls an exemplary housewife and to make Protestant missionaries among their relatives and colleagues."[^15] However, the school also exposed students to progressive ideas about women's rights, national self-determination, and social justice that would profoundly influence Yu's development as an activist. The education she received at Ewha provided not only academic knowledge but also exposure to international ideas of independence and human rights that were sweeping across colonized nations in the early twentieth century.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

Yu Gwan-sun's emergence as a prominent independence activist occurred during the March 1st Movement of 1919, a watershed moment in Korean history that transformed the nation's struggle against Japanese colonial rule.[^17] Korea had been placed under Japanese military rule in 1905 and officially annexed in 1910 as part of Japan's thirty-five-year imperialist expansion.[^18] By 1919, international developments—particularly U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's advocacy for national self-determination following World War I—gave hope to Koreans pressing for independence.[^19]

The March 1st Movement was initiated by 33 Korean cultural and religious leaders who, after almost a decade of Japanese rule, drew up a "Proclamation of Independence" and organized mass demonstrations throughout Korea beginning on March 1, 1919.[^20] Although the movement was organized by leaders of the Chondogyo religion, 15 of the 33 signatories were Protestants, reflecting the strong connection between Christianity and Korean nationalism.[^21] The demonstrations represented one of the first major displays of nonviolent resistance against colonial rule in twentieth-century Asia.

On March 1, 1919, Seoul erupted with marches by people nationwide protesting the Japanese occupation.[^22] Yu Gwan-sun and her Ewha classmates joined these historic protests after organizers arrived at their school encouraging students to participate. On March 5, Yu marched with her classmates to Namdaemun in central Seoul, joining others in the streets with cries of "Mansei!" ("Long live Korean independence!").[^23] The student protesters were detained by police but were freed shortly after when missionaries from their school negotiated their release.[^24]

In response to the spreading demonstrations, the Japanese colonial government ordered all Korean schools to close on March 10, 1919.[^25] This decision inadvertently created an opportunity for Yu to return to her hometown and take a more active role in the independence movement. Rather than remaining passive, the seventeen-year-old student decided to organize resistance in her home region of Cheonan, demonstrating leadership qualities and courage that would define her legacy.

Upon returning to her village on March 13, 1919, Yu immediately began organizing.[^26] Along with her family, she went door-to-door encouraging the public to join the independence movement. She spread word of a planned demonstration that she organized with fellow activists Cho In-won and Kim Goo-eung, rallying people from neighboring towns including Yeongi, Chungju, Cheonan, and Jincheon.[^27] Yu's organizational abilities and passionate advocacy convinced thousands to participate in what would become one of the movement's most significant rural demonstrations.

On the night of March 31, 1919—the eve of the planned rally—Yu climbed to the top of Mount Maebong and lit a beacon fire, signaling to surrounding villages that the time for action had come.[^28] This dramatic gesture demonstrated both her strategic thinking and her understanding of traditional Korean communication methods. The beacon fire served as a rallying point, calling patriots to gather for the demonstration that would change Yu's life and secure her place in Korean history.

## The Aunae Marketplace Demonstration

The demonstration took place on April 1, 1919 (March 1 according to the lunar calendar), at Aunae Marketplace beginning at 9:00 a.m.[^29] Approximately 3,000 demonstrators gathered, an extraordinary number for a rural area, waving the Taegeukgi (Korea's national flag) and chanting "Long live Korean independence!" and "10,000 years of independence!" (Daehan Doklib Mansei).[^30] The peaceful protesters, including men, women, children, and elderly residents, represented a cross-section of Korean society united in their demand for freedom from colonial oppression.

Yu Gwan-sun played a central leadership role in the demonstration. Cho In-won read the Declaration of Independence, while Yu led the crowd in cheering for independence, her voice rising above thousands of others in defiant calls for liberation.[^31] The demonstration was entirely nonviolent, with participants engaging in peaceful protest and symbolic resistance rather than armed confrontation. The protesters sought to express their national identity and demand their right to self-determination through moral force and collective action.

However, the Japanese colonial authorities responded with brutal violence. By 1:00 p.m., Japanese military police arrived at the marketplace and opened fire on the peaceful demonstrators.[^32] The massacre that followed killed 19 people and wounded many others.[^33] Among those killed were Yu's father, Yu Jung-kwon, and her mother, Lee So-je, who died while shouting for independence.[^34] The loss of both parents in a single day would have broken many people, but for Yu Gwan-sun, it intensified her commitment to the cause for which they had given their lives.

The Aunae Marketplace demonstration became one of the most significant events of the March 1st Movement in rural Korea. Before the Japanese finally suppressed the movement twelve months later, approximately 2,000,000 Koreans had participated in more than 1,500 demonstrations across the country and internationally.[^35] The Japanese colonial authorities responded with systematic brutality, leading to 7,509 deaths, 45,000 injuries, and over 47,000 arrests.[^36] The March 1st Movement did not achieve immediate independence, but it established the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai and inspired anti-imperialist movements in China, the Philippines, Egypt, and India.[^37]

## Arrest, Trial, and Imprisonment

Following the Aunae Marketplace demonstration, Yu Gwan-sun was arrested by Japanese military police.[^38] The authorities, recognizing the threat posed by this young activist, offered Yu a lighter sentence in exchange for an admission of guilt and her cooperation in identifying other collaborators in the protest.[^39] Despite the promise of reduced punishment and the trauma of having just witnessed her parents' deaths, Yu refused to comply and remained silent even under heavy interrogation and torture.[^40]

Yu was transferred through Gongju Prison before arriving at Seodaemun Prison in Seoul, the notorious facility where the Japanese colonial government imprisoned political dissidents.[^41] At the Gongju District Court, she was initially sentenced to five years in prison for violating the security law, an exceptionally harsh sentence given that national leader Son Byong-hi received only a three-year sentence.[^42] Yu defied the decision and lodged an appeal with the Gyeongseong Court of Review (now Seoul High Court).[^43]

Court documents from the Gyeongseong Court of Review detailed her activities, noting that she returned to her hometown on March 13, 1919, planned the protest at Byeongcheon market, and participated in demonstrations with thousands of people on April 1, 1919.[^44] The appeal resulted in her sentence being reduced from five years to three years, though this remained a severe punishment for a teenage student whose only "crime" was demanding her nation's freedom.[^45]

Conditions at Seodaemun Prison were brutal, designed to break the spirit of independence activists. However, imprisonment did not diminish Yu's commitment to the cause. She continued her cry for independence from within prison walls, refusing to give up under torture.[^46] Her cell became another venue for resistance rather than a place of submission. Yu demanded the release of other prisoners and organized fellow inmates to continue the struggle.[^47]

On March 1, 1920, the first anniversary of the March 1st Movement, Yu organized a massive campaign with her imprisoned comrades to commemorate the movement and demonstrate that their commitment to independence remained unbroken.[^48] This act of defiance led to Yu being held in an underground cell and subjected to even more severe torture.[^49] In that small basement cell, prison guards subjected Yu to 93 different types of torture, an almost incomprehensible level of cruelty directed at a teenage girl.[^50]

Throughout her imprisonment, Yu wrote and spoke powerful words that captured her unwavering commitment. In one of her most famous statements, she wrote: "Even if my fingernails are torn out, my nose and ears are ripped apart, and my legs and arms are crushed, this physical pain does not compare to the pain of losing my nation. My only remorse is not being able to do more than dedicating my life to my country."[^51] She also challenged her captors directly: "I took fair and just action to reclaim my country, yet you respond with force and bloodshed. If anyone has committed a crime isn't it you, the Japanese, who stole our country illegally?"[^52]

## Death and Immediate Aftermath

Yu Gwan-sun died at approximately 8:00 a.m. on September 28, 1920, at Seodaemun Prison.[^53] She was just 17 years old (or 18 by Korean age reckoning).[^54] The official cause of death was attributed to injuries sustained from repeated torture and beatings, combined with severe malnutrition and the harsh conditions of imprisonment.[^55] Her body bore the evidence of the 93 types of torture she had endured, testifying to the brutality of the Japanese colonial authorities' treatment of this young patriot.[^56]

The circumstances of Yu's death and the subsequent handling of her remains revealed the Japanese authorities' awareness of her symbolic importance. Initially, officials were reluctant to release her body, fearing that her funeral would become another occasion for independence demonstrations. However, Lulu Frey and Jeannette Walter, the principals of Ewha Haktang, voiced their suspicions of torture to the public and applied pressure on authorities to release Yu's body.[^57] The school officials' advocacy eventually succeeded, though authorities released Yu's body in a Saucony Vacuum Company oil crate—a final indignity that underscored their contempt for Korean dignity.[^58]

Jeannette Walter, who dressed Yu for her funeral, later stated in a 1959 interview that Yu's body had not been cut into pieces as rumors had suggested, though this clarification only highlighted the extent of the torture that had been inflicted.[^59] Yu's funeral was held in a private manner at Jung-Dong Church, reflecting her Christian faith and providing an opportunity for mourning within the religious community that had nurtured her.[^60]

After her death, Yu was buried in Itaewon Cemetery. However, during the Japanese colonial period, the cemetery was destroyed and her body was lost when the Japanese Empire moved the tombs to create a military base.[^61] This loss meant that no physical remains exist at the current Yu Gwan-sun Memorial Hall, though visitors can still visit a shrine built in her honor and pay respects to her memory.[^62] The destruction of her grave represented another attempt to erase the memory of Korean resistance, though it ultimately failed as Yu's legacy only grew stronger over time.

## Major Achievements and Impact

Yu Gwan-sun's primary achievement was transforming the March 1st Movement from primarily an urban, elite phenomenon into a mass rural movement that engaged ordinary Koreans across class and regional boundaries.[^63] By organizing the Aunae Marketplace demonstration, she demonstrated that resistance to Japanese colonialism was not limited to students and intellectuals in Seoul but resonated with farmers, merchants, and villagers throughout the countryside. Her successful mobilization of approximately 3,000 people in a rural area showed the depth of Korean nationalist sentiment and the broad-based nature of the independence movement.[^64]

Yu's unflinching courage in the face of torture and her refusal to cooperate with Japanese authorities became a powerful symbol of Korean resistance. Her willingness to sacrifice her life for independence inspired countless other Koreans to join the struggle, even when faced with severe repression.[^65] Her famous statement comparing physical pain to "the pain of losing my nation" articulated the profound psychological and spiritual dimensions of colonialism, elevating the independence movement beyond mere political struggle to a matter of national dignity and identity.[^66]

The role Yu played in representing women's participation in the independence movement was historically significant. March 1st was a pivotal moment for Korean women, normalizing their role in the political sphere at a time when public exposure was seen as erosive to feminine morality.[^67] Yu symbolized not only the resolve of the nation to be independent but also represented all the women who led the March 1st Movement, including women students, gisaeng (entertainers), uneducated housewives, and women from classes thought to be of low status.[^68]

Yu's activism contributed to the establishment of the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai, which was formed in April 1919 partially in response to the March 1st Movement's demonstration of Korean aspirations for independence.[^69] This government-in-exile provided institutional structure to the independence movement and maintained Korea's claim to sovereignty throughout the colonial period until liberation in 1945.

The March 1st Movement, in which Yu played such a prominent role, also had international impact beyond Korea. It influenced the rise of the anti-imperialist May Fourth Movement in China two months later, inspired the 1919 anti-imperialist resistance in the Philippines and Egypt, and provided impetus to the Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance) movement in India.[^70] Yu's story thus became part of a global narrative of anti-colonial resistance and the struggle for self-determination in the early twentieth century.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many political figures, Yu Gwan-sun's legacy has been subject to remarkably little controversy or criticism within Korea, where she is almost universally revered as a national hero.[^71] However, several scholarly and historical issues merit examination to provide a balanced assessment of her life and legacy.

One area of historical debate concerns the extent to which Yu's story has been mythologized. Legends have grown around her memory, including stories that on March 1st, statues of Yu Gwan-sun will march around shouting "Long Live Korean Independence" and that if you say her name to one of her statues, the head will turn and she will look into your eyes.[^72] While these legends reflect the deep reverence Koreans feel for Yu, they also illustrate how historical figures can become semi-mythical, potentially obscuring the historical reality of her life and the broader movement she represented.

The specific details of Yu's torture and death have been subject to rumor and exaggeration. While Jeannette Walter confirmed in 1959 that Yu's body had not been dismembered as some rumors suggested, the precise nature and extent of the torture she endured remains partially documented.[^73] The claim that she was subjected to "93 different types of torture" appears in multiple sources but lacks detailed documentation of what these specific tortures entailed.[^74] This ambiguity raises questions about how memory and documentation interact in constructing historical narratives of martyrdom.

Some scholars have noted that Yu's prominence may overshadow other female independence activists who made equally significant contributions. According to official records, women leaders recognized for independence activism account for only 1.8 percent of those awarded for contribution to Korea's independence movement—just 270 out of 14,264 total recipients.[^75] Figures like Kim Maria, who founded the Korean-American Anti-Japanese Women's Activist Organization and whom independence activist Ahn Chang-ho praised by saying "If we had ten people like Kim Maria, the country would have gained independence on its own," have received less public recognition than Yu.[^76] This raises questions about which stories are preserved and celebrated in national memory and why.

From a Japanese nationalist perspective during the colonial period, Yu and other March 1st Movement activists were viewed as dangerous insurgents threatening public order and Japanese sovereignty over Korea. Japanese authorities justified their brutal suppression of the movement as necessary to maintain stability and legitimate governance.[^77] While this perspective has been thoroughly discredited by subsequent history and moral judgment, understanding it provides context for the violence inflicted upon Yu and other activists.

Some contemporary scholars have examined whether the focus on individual martyrs like Yu serves to romanticize resistance in ways that may obscure the systematic, collective, and often mundane work of building independence movements. The emphasis on dramatic sacrifice and youthful martyrdom, while emotionally powerful and inspirationally valuable, may underrepresent the sustained organizational work, ideological development, and practical coalition-building that characterized the broader independence movement.[^78]

## Personal Life and Character

Yu Gwan-sun's personal life was tragically brief, cut short before she could experience the normal milestones of adulthood, marriage, or career. At the time of her death, she was only 17 years old, having devoted her teenage years to education and activism rather than personal pursuits.[^79] Her commitment to the independence cause meant that traditional aspects of personal life—romantic relationships, family planning, or professional development—never materialized.

Yu's personality was marked by several distinctive traits that those who knew her consistently emphasized. Her intelligence was exceptional, demonstrated by her ability to memorize Bible passages after a single hearing.[^80] This intellectual gift, combined with educational opportunities rare for Korean women of her era, equipped her with knowledge and analytical skills that informed her activism. However, Yu's character was defined by more than intellectual capacity; she possessed remarkable moral courage and determination.

Friends and family remembered Yu's strong sense of justice and her compassion for the underprivileged. She could not tolerate immoral actions and actively helped those in need, reflecting Christian values of service and social justice that her family and Ewha education had instilled.[^81] This moral sensitivity made the injustice of colonial oppression personally intolerable to her, transforming abstract political concepts into deeply felt imperatives for action.

Yu's bravery and perseverance were her most defining characteristics, making it possible for her to become a freedom fighter who rebelled against Japanese colonialism.[^82] These qualities were tested under the most extreme circumstances—watching her parents murdered, enduring brutal torture, facing death at seventeen—yet she never wavered in her commitment. Her refusal to cooperate with authorities even when offered reduced punishment demonstrated not just courage but principled integrity that valued national liberation above personal survival.[^83]

Her relationships with her Ewha classmates appear to have been important, as she participated in demonstrations alongside fellow students and maintained connections to the school community that advocated for her after her death.[^84] The fact that Ewha principals Lulu Frey and Jeannette Walter fought for the release of her body and that Walter personally dressed her for burial suggests meaningful relationships between Yu and the missionary educators who shaped her development.[^85]

Yu's Christian faith was central to her identity and worldview. Growing up in a devout Protestant household, attending church regularly, and studying at a Christian mission school, Yu's understanding of justice, sacrifice, and moral purpose was deeply informed by Christian theology.[^86] Her willingness to suffer martyrdom for a cause greater than herself reflects Christian narratives of redemptive suffering, while her challenge to Japanese authorities echoed prophetic traditions of speaking truth to power.

The extended Yu family's commitment to independence—nine members across three generations participating in the movement—suggests that Yu's activism was not merely individual heroism but reflected family values and collective commitment.[^87] Her older brother, Yu Woo-seok, was also an independence activist who was imprisoned for his participation in the movement, dying at age 70 in 1968 and receiving posthumous recognition with the National Foundation Medal of Patriotic Merit in 1990.[^88]

## Legacy and Commemoration

Yu Gwan-sun has become one of the most famous and celebrated figures in Korean history, achieving a status comparable to few other independence activists.[^89] Known as "Korea's Joan of Arc," she symbolizes courage, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to national liberation.[^90] Her story has been taught to generations of Korean schoolchildren, making her name synonymous with patriotic resistance and youthful idealism in service of justice.

Since 1946, memorial services organized by Ewha Womans University have honored Yu annually, maintaining connection between the institution that educated her and the cause for which she died.[^91] In 1972, a shrine was built in her honor in the township of Byeongcheon-myeon in Cheonan with cooperation from South Chungcheong Province and the Cheonan army.[^92] Many statues of Yu exist at universities and schools throughout South Korea, serving as physical reminders of her legacy and inspiration for students.[^93]

The Yu Gwan-sun Memorial Hall in Cheonan welcomes visitors who wish to learn about her life and pay respects. Although no physical remains exist at the site due to the destruction of Itaewon Cemetery during the Japanese colonial period, the memorial provides educational resources and space for reflection on her contributions.[^94] The memorial has become an important site for historical education and national remembrance, particularly around March 1st, when the March 1st Movement is commemorated as a national holiday in South Korea.[^95]

Official recognition of Yu's contributions has evolved over time, reflecting changing understandings of her significance. On March 1, 1962, the Korean government posthumously awarded Yu the Order of Merit for National Foundation, specifically a third-grade Independence Medal.[^96] However, on the occasion of the March 1st Movement's 100th anniversary in 2019, President Moon Jae-in's government upgraded this honor during a Cabinet meeting. Yu was awarded the Republic of Korea Medal—the highest of the five ranks of national decorations—recognizing her extraordinary contributions to Korean independence.[^97] In 1996, Ewha Girls High School awarded her an honorary high school diploma, symbolically completing the education interrupted by her activism and imprisonment.[^98]

Yu's cultural impact extends beyond official memorials and honors. Her story has been portrayed in multiple films across several decades, including productions in 1948, 1959, 1966, and 1974, all titled "Yu Gwan-sun."[^99] In 2019, marking the centennial of the March 1st Movement, she was portrayed by Go Ah-seong in the film "A Resistance" and by Lee Sae-bom in the documentary "1919 Yu Gwan-sun."[^100] The 2019 film "A Resistance: The Story of Yu Gwan-sun," directed by Jo Min-ho, delved deeper into her emotions during imprisonment, humanizing her experience beyond simple martyrdom narratives.[^101]

Yu also appears in literature, including Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's experimental novel "Dictee," which explores themes of memory, language, and Korean diasporic experience through multiple historical and personal narratives.[^102] In 2018, The New York Times published an obituary for Yu as part of its "Overlooked" series, which recognizes significant historical figures whose deaths were not originally covered by the newspaper, bringing international attention to her story.[^103]

Yu's legacy continues to resonate in contemporary Korean society, where her example is invoked in discussions of civic courage, youth activism, and resistance to injustice. The March 1st Movement, in which she played such a prominent role, is celebrated annually as a national holiday (Samiljeol), ensuring that each generation of Koreans encounters her story and the broader history of the independence struggle.[^104] Her image and story serve educational purposes, teaching values of patriotism, courage, and moral integrity to Korean children.

The comparison to Joan of Arc—though perhaps somewhat reductive—captures important dimensions of Yu's symbolic significance: both were young women who challenged powerful empires, both suffered martyrdom for their causes, and both became enduring symbols of national resistance and identity.[^105] This comparison also situates Yu within a global tradition of resistance figures, connecting Korean independence struggles to broader narratives of liberation and self-determination.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians have consistently praised Yu Gwan-sun as embodying the spirit of Korean resistance to colonialism and representing the crucial role of youth and women in the independence movement.[^106] She is recognized as "the most famous young woman of the March 1 Movement" and known in historical records as the "Nation's Sister" and the "Flower of the Independence Movement."[^107] These titles reflect widespread scholarly consensus about her historical significance and symbolic importance.

Academic assessments emphasize that Yu's significance extends beyond her individual actions to what she represents collectively. Historians note that she symbolizes all the women who led the March 1st Movement, including women students, gisaeng (entertainers), uneducated housewives, and women from social classes thought to be of low status.[^108] This representative function makes Yu's legacy important not just for commemorating one person's sacrifice but for recognizing the broad-based, cross-class nature of Korean resistance to colonialism.

Scholars of Korean women's history particularly value Yu's role in normalizing women's participation in the political sphere. As researchers note, March 1st was pivotal for Korean women, legitimizing their public political engagement at a time when such visibility was considered erosive to feminine morality.[^109] Yu's leadership in organizing the Aunae Marketplace demonstration and her continued activism in prison challenged gender norms and expanded possibilities for women's political participation in subsequent decades.

The March 1st Movement, in which Yu played such a central role, is recognized by scholars as a watershed moment in Korean history that "re-centered Korean identity and redefined Koreans as an independent people who yearn for peace and self-determination."[^110] Yu's sacrifice and courage are seen as embodying these aspirations and making abstract political concepts tangible through personal witness.

Ten days after the April 19 Revolution of 1960, the chairman of the Democratic Party policy committee wrote in a UPI article that "Korea has a great revolutionary tradition of 10 generations, including Yu Gwan-sun, in terms of political transformation," positioning her within a long tradition of Korean resistance and reform movements.[^111] This assessment connects Yu to broader patterns of Korean political culture emphasizing moral courage and willingness to sacrifice for collective good.

International scholars have recognized the March 1st Movement's global significance as an early example of mass nonviolent resistance to colonial rule, prefiguring later independence movements across Asia and Africa.[^112] Yu's role in this movement therefore contributes to global narratives about decolonization, nonviolent resistance, and popular mobilization against imperial oppression.

### Critical and Nuanced Views

While overwhelmingly positive assessments dominate scholarly literature on Yu Gwan-sun, some historians have offered more nuanced perspectives that situate her within broader historiographical questions about memory, nationalism, and historical representation. These critical perspectives do not diminish Yu's courage or significance but seek to understand how her story has been constructed, remembered, and deployed in Korean historical consciousness.

Some scholars note that the available primary sources about Yu's life are relatively limited, with much of the historical record constructed from later testimonies, institutional records, and collective memory rather than extensive contemporary documentation.[^113] This evidentiary limitation raises methodological questions about how historians distinguish documented historical facts from subsequent mythologization, though it does not invalidate the core narrative of Yu's activism and martyrdom.

Researchers studying historical memory and nationalism have examined how Yu's story functions in Korean national consciousness, sometimes serving state-building and nationalist purposes that may simplify the complex realities of the independence movement.[^114] The emphasis on youthful martyrdom and individual heroism, while inspirationally valuable, may sometimes overshadow the sustained organizational work, ideological diversity, and practical coalition-building that characterized the broader independence movement.

Feminist historians, while celebrating Yu's courage and impact, have also noted that the overwhelming focus on her as the representative female independence activist may inadvertently marginalize other women whose contributions were equally significant but less dramatically concluded.[^115] The fact that women account for only 1.8 percent of those officially recognized for independence contributions suggests systematic underrepresentation that focusing on a single iconic figure cannot fully address.[^116]

Some scholars have questioned whether the comparison to Joan of Arc, while capturing certain similarities, may impose European historical frameworks onto Korean experience in ways that obscure distinctively Korean cultural, religious, and political contexts.[^117] The analogy, though popular and emotionally resonant, may reflect more about cross-cultural communication than about the specific meaning of Yu's life within Korean historical development.

Critical historians have also examined how Yu's story has been invoked in different political contexts throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, sometimes serving competing ideological agendas in South Korean politics.[^118] Her legacy has been claimed by various political movements, raising questions about how historical figures become sites of contemporary political contestation and memory.

Written while imprisoned at Seodaemun Prison, this statement became Yu's most famous expression of her commitment to Korean independence, articulating how the spiritual and psychological pain of colonialism exceeded even the most severe physical torture.[^119]

> "I took fair and just action to reclaim my country, yet you respond with force and bloodshed. If anyone has committed a crime isn't it you, the Japanese, who stole our country illegally?"

Yu's direct challenge to her Japanese captors, questioning the moral authority of colonial rule and asserting the legitimacy of Korean resistance.[^120]

> "Long live Korean independence!" (Daehan Doklib Mansei / 대한독립만세!)

The rallying cry Yu led at the Aunae Marketplace demonstration and continued shouting from prison, which became the defining slogan of the March 1st Movement.[^121]

> "10,000 years of independence!" (Doklib Mansei / 독립만세!)

Another version of the independence cry that Yu and fellow protesters chanted, expressing the eternal nature of Korean national identity and aspirations for freedom.[^122]
