## Summary

Muhammad Ahmad was a Sudanese Sufi leader who proclaimed himself the Mahdi (divinely guided redeemer) in 1881 and led a successful revolution against Turco-Egyptian rule. His forces defeated the British General Gordon at Khartoum in 1885. He established a theocratic state in Sudan based on his interpretation of Islam. He died shortly after the fall of Khartoum, but his Mahdist state endured until 1898.
