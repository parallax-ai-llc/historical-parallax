## Summary

On April 4, 1968, at 6:01 p.m., Martin Luther King Jr. stepped onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. A single rifle shot echoed across the courtyard. The most important civil rights leader in American history fell, mortally wounded. He was pronounced dead an hour later. He was 39 years old. An escaped convict named James Earl Ray would plead guilty to the murder—and then spend the rest of his life claiming he didn't do it.[^1]

The official story is straightforward: Ray, a white racist, stalked King to Memphis and shot him from a rooming house across the street. He fled to England, was captured, and pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty. Case closed. But Ray recanted within days, claiming he was set up by a mysterious figure named "Raoul." He sought a trial he never received. And the King family themselves came to believe Ray was innocent—that the U.S. government killed Martin Luther King Jr.[^2]

In 1999, a Memphis jury agreed with the King family, finding that agencies of the government participated in a conspiracy to assassinate King. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated and disagreed. Documents remain classified. The truth, more than 50 years later, remains contested—not just by conspiracy theorists, but by King's own children, who shook hands with their father's convicted killer and called him a scapegoat.[^3]

- Possible involvement of Ray's brothers
- Possible St. Louis-based conspiracy to finance assassination

## The Conspiracy Theories

### The Government Did It

**The theory:**
- FBI hated King (documented)
- COINTELPRO targeted him
- Hoover called him dangerous
- Military intelligence surveilled him
- Government wanted him eliminated

**The evidence:**
- Massive FBI campaign against King (proven)
- Wiretaps, harassment (proven)
- Letter encouraging suicide (proven)
- Direct involvement in murder? Not proven

**Status:** Government hostility documented; murder conspiracy not proven[^9]

### The "Raoul" Theory

**Ray's claim:**
- A mysterious man named "Raoul" directed his movements
- Ray was set up as patsy
- Raoul gave him money, the rifle, instructions
- Ray was in rooming house but didn't shoot

**The evidence:**
- No "Raoul" ever identified
- Ray's story varied over time
- Could be fabrication to escape responsibility

**Status:** Central to Ray's defense; never verified[^10]

### Loyd Jowers Confession

**1993:**
- Loyd Jowers (Memphis restaurant owner) claimed on TV:
- He was paid $100,000 to help kill King
- Hired a Memphis policeman as shooter
- Organized crime and government involved

**1999 civil trial:**
- King family sued Jowers
- Jury found: **King was killed as result of conspiracy**
- Awarded family $100 (symbolic)
- Jury said: Government agencies involved

**The verdict:**
- Civil court, not criminal
- Lower standard of proof
- DOJ investigated; found Jowers not credible
- But: King family believed it confirmed their suspicions[^11]

### Memphis Police Involvement

**The theory:**
- Security was withdrawn from King that morning
- Normally a police detail accompanied him
- Black officers removed from surveillance duty
- Convenient?

**The evidence:**
- Pattern is suggestive
- No direct evidence of police shooting
- DOJ: Found no conspiracy

**Status:** Suspicious pattern; not proven[^12]
