## Summary

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., born November 20, 1942, is an American politician who served as the 46th President of the United States from 2021 to 2025[^1]. Before his presidency, Biden represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for 36 years (1973-2009) and served as the 47th Vice President under Barack Obama (2009-2017)[^2]. His presidency was marked by significant legislative achievements including the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, though it was also overshadowed by controversies including the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal and concerns about his age[^3]. Biden made history as the first Roman Catholic president and, at age 78, the oldest person to assume the presidency[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[^5]. He was the eldest of four children in a devout Catholic family of Irish descent, with siblings Valerie, James, and Francis[^6]. His mother traced her roots to County Louth or County Londonderry in Ireland, while his father had English, French, and Irish ancestry[^7].

Biden's early childhood was marked by financial instability. His father had once enjoyed an affluent lifestyle, but suffered severe financial setbacks shortly after Biden's birth[^8]. For several years, the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton before moving to Delaware in 1953[^9]. The family first resided in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before eventually settling in a house in Mayfield, Delaware[^10]. Biden's father eventually found success as a used-car salesman, which allowed the family to maintain a middle-class lifestyle[^11].

As a child, Biden struggled with a severe stutter, which he worked tirelessly to overcome through practice and determination[^12]. This challenge would later inform his empathetic approach to politics and his connection with Americans facing their own obstacles. He attended Archmere Academy, a Catholic prep school, where he excelled in both academics and student leadership[^13]. Biden served as class president during his junior and senior years, demonstrating early political acumen and popularity among his peers[^14]. He graduated from Archmere in 1961 and went on to the University of Delaware[^15].

At the University of Delaware, Biden pursued a double major in history and political science, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965[^16]. During his undergraduate years, he met Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, whom he married in 1966[^17]. Biden then attended Syracuse University College of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1968, ranking 76th in a class of 85 students[^18]. By the time he completed law school, Biden and Neilia had welcomed their first child, with two more children to follow shortly thereafter[^19].

## Rise to Power

Biden's entry into politics came remarkably early. In 1970, at age 27, he was elected to the New Castle County Council in Delaware, serving from 1970 to 1972[^20]. This local political experience provided him with a foundation in governance and constituent services that would serve him throughout his career. However, it was his audacious 1972 campaign for the U.S. Senate that would launch him onto the national stage[^21].

In 1972, Biden challenged Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs for Delaware's U.S. Senate seat[^22]. At just 29 years old, Biden was the only Democrat willing to take on Boggs, who was heavily favored to win[^23]. With minimal campaign funds and virtually no name recognition outside of New Castle County, Biden was given no chance of victory by political observers[^24]. However, running a grassroots campaign with his family's help—his sister Valerie served as campaign manager—Biden focused on door-to-door retail politics and connecting with working-class voters[^25].

Against all odds, Biden defeated Boggs by a margin of 3,162 votes, becoming one of the youngest people ever elected to the U.S. Senate[^26]. However, this triumph was immediately followed by devastating tragedy. Just weeks after his election victory, on December 18, 1972, Biden's wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident while Christmas shopping[^27]. His two sons, Beau and Hunter, were seriously injured but survived[^28]. The accident occurred when their station wagon was struck by a tractor-trailer[^29].

Grief-stricken and contemplating resignation before even taking office, Biden was persuaded by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield to be sworn in and give the Senate a try[^30]. Biden took the oath of office in January 1973 at his sons' hospital bedsides, beginning what would become one of the longest Senate careers in American history[^31]. He made the decision to commute daily from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington, D.C., by Amtrak train—a 90-minute journey each way—so he could be home with his sons every night[^32]. This daily commute became a defining characteristic of Biden's Senate career, earning him the nickname "Amtrak Joe" and connecting him to countless Delaware constituents during his travels[^33].

## Major Achievements

### Senate Career (1973-2009)

During his 36 years in the U.S. Senate, Biden established himself as a significant legislative force, particularly in the areas of criminal justice, foreign policy, and judicial confirmations[^34]. He served as chairman or ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years and held the same positions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 11 years[^35].

One of Biden's most significant legislative accomplishments came in 1994 when he drafted and shepherded the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act through Congress[^36]. This comprehensive crime bill, which Biden called his "proudest legislative accomplishment," included provisions for 100,000 new police officers, billions in funding for prisons, and an expansion of the death penalty for federal crimes[^37]. While supporters credited the legislation with contributing to declining crime rates in the 1990s, critics later argued it contributed to mass incarceration, particularly affecting African American communities[^38].

Also in 1994, Biden authored the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), landmark legislation that provided federal resources for investigating and prosecuting violent crimes against women and established the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice[^39]. The act created the first federal laws specifically addressing domestic violence and sexual assault, fundamentally changing how the justice system responds to gender-based violence[^40]. VAWA has been reauthorized multiple times with bipartisan support and is widely regarded as one of Biden's most consequential legislative achievements[^41].

As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden presided over six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings[^42]. Two of these hearings became particularly contentious and nationally significant: the 1987 confirmation hearing for Robert Bork and the 1991 hearing for Clarence Thomas[^43]. Biden's questioning of Bork focused on constitutional philosophy and ultimately contributed to the Senate's rejection of the nomination[^44]. The Thomas hearings became controversial when law professor Anita Hill testified about allegations of sexual harassment, with Biden later acknowledging he could have handled the proceedings better, particularly in protecting Hill from aggressive questioning[^45].

In foreign policy, Biden played a crucial role during pivotal moments in post-Cold War history[^46]. During the 1990s, he was an advocate for U.S. intervention in the Balkans to stop ethnic cleansing[^47]. After the September 11 attacks, Biden voted to authorize military force in Afghanistan and initially supported the 2003 Iraq War, though he later became a critic of the war's execution[^48]. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2007 to 2009, Biden advocated for a political settlement in Iraq that would involve partitioning the country into three semi-autonomous regions—a proposal known as the "Biden Plan"—though this approach was never implemented[^49].

### Vice Presidency (2009-2017)

Barack Obama selected Biden as his running mate in August 2008, with Biden's foreign policy expertise and appeal to white working-class voters complementing Obama's candidacy[^50]. After their victory in November 2008, Biden became the 47th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 2009, serving two full terms[^51]. He was the first vice president from Delaware and the first Roman Catholic to hold the office[^52].

Biden's role in the Obama administration was unusually influential for a vice president[^53]. According to administration officials, Biden's primary function was to serve as a contrarian voice in policy discussions, forcing others to defend their positions and ensuring all perspectives were considered[^54]. Obama and Biden developed an exceptionally close working relationship, with observers noting that perhaps no vice president in history remained as trusted by the president throughout an entire eight-year tenure[^55].

President Obama assigned Biden responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion stimulus package designed to combat the Great Recession[^56]. Biden traveled extensively to monitor infrastructure projects and ensure accountability in spending[^57]. When Biden completed this oversight role in February 2011, he reported that fraud incidents with stimulus funds had been kept below one percent[^58].

Biden also took the lead on winding down U.S. military involvement in Iraq, making numerous trips to the country and engaging with Iraqi leaders to facilitate the transition[^59]. Additionally, he undertook diplomatic missions worldwide, representing the administration in sensitive negotiations and relationship-building with foreign leaders[^60]. His experience and relationships in Washington proved valuable in negotiating with Congress, particularly during divided government when Republicans controlled the House of Representatives[^61].

### Presidency (2021-2025)

Biden announced his candidacy for president in April 2019, framing his campaign as a "battle for the soul of our nation" and positioning himself as a moderate alternative to Donald Trump[^62]. After a challenging start in the Democratic primaries, Biden's campaign gained momentum with a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary, leading to his securing the Democratic nomination[^63]. He selected California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman and first South Asian American on a major party's presidential ticket[^64].

The 2020 general election, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, saw Biden defeat incumbent President Donald Trump by winning 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232 and receiving 81,283,501 popular votes—the most votes ever cast for a presidential candidate in U.S. history[^65]. Biden's victory hinged on narrow wins in the "blue wall" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as flipping traditionally Republican Arizona and Georgia[^66]. He and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021, with Biden becoming the oldest person to assume the presidency at age 78[^67].

Biden's presidency was defined by ambitious legislative achievements during his first two years when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress[^68]. In March 2021, he signed the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that included direct payments to Americans, extended unemployment benefits, and funding for vaccine distribution[^69]. The bill's expanded Child Tax Credit temporarily cut child poverty nearly in half to a historic low[^70].

In November 2021, Biden achieved a bipartisan victory with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion package representing the largest investment in American infrastructure in generations[^71]. The law allocated $284 billion for transportation, $65 billion for broadband internet expansion, $73 billion for power infrastructure modernization, and $55 billion for clean drinking water[^72]. This legislation fulfilled a long-sought goal of upgrading America's deteriorating roads, bridges, and utilities[^73].

Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act in August 2022, appropriating $280 billion to boost American semiconductor manufacturing and research, addressing supply chain vulnerabilities exposed during the pandemic[^74]. Later that month, he secured passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in U.S. history, which allocated hundreds of billions for clean energy transition, electric vehicle incentives, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction[^75]. The act also included healthcare provisions capping prescription drug costs for Medicare recipients at $2,000 annually and limiting insulin costs to $35 per month for seniors[^76].

Additional significant legislation included the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first major federal gun control law in nearly three decades[^77]; the Honoring our PACT Act, expanding healthcare for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits[^78]; the Respect for Marriage Act, requiring federal recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages[^79]; and the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, making lynching a federal hate crime for the first time in American history[^80].

Under Biden's presidency, the economy added 16.6 million jobs, with his administration claiming to be the only one in history to create jobs every single month of its tenure[^81]. Unemployment reached historic lows, and American entrepreneurs filed a record 21 million new business applications during his term[^82]. However, inflation surged to 40-year highs in 2022, driven by pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, government spending, and the war in Ukraine, before moderating in 2023-2024[^83].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Afghanistan Withdrawal

The most damaging crisis of Biden's presidency came in August 2021 with the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan[^84]. Biden had announced in April 2021 that all American troops would leave Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, later moving the deadline to August 31[^85]. The withdrawal culminated in the Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan, including the fall of Kabul on August 15[^86].

Scenes of desperate Afghans clinging to departing U.S. military aircraft and the deadly August 26 suicide bombing at Kabul's airport—which killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans—became defining images of the withdrawal[^87]. A Republican-led House investigation concluded that the Biden administration prioritized "optics" over safety and misled the American public about the deteriorating security situation[^88]. The report claimed administration officials "watered down" intelligence warnings and failed to launch emergency evacuations until it was too late[^89].

Criticism of the withdrawal was notably bipartisan, with Republicans harshly condemning the administration's execution while Democrats acknowledged the withdrawal's chaotic nature even as they noted Biden was implementing policies initiated by his predecessor[^90]. The Biden administration defended its actions, pointing out that the Trump administration's 2020 Doha Agreement with the Taliban had set withdrawal in motion and constrained Biden's options[^91]. Nevertheless, the Afghanistan withdrawal significantly damaged Biden's approval ratings and became a lasting stain on his presidency[^92].

### Hunter Biden Investigations

Biden's presidency was shadowed by ongoing investigations into his son, Hunter Biden, who became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of federal crimes[^93]. In June 2024, Hunter Biden was convicted on three felony charges related to lying on a gun purchase form in 2018 by falsely stating he was not using or addicted to drugs[^94]. He was separately charged with tax-related offenses[^95].

Federal investigations into Hunter Biden's business dealings, led by Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Weiss, had been ongoing since 2018[^96]. House Republicans, particularly Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, conducted extensive investigations claiming the Biden family engaged in "influence peddling" that compromised national security[^97]. The basic accusation was that Hunter Biden, during a period of severe drug addiction, made millions from foreign companies trading on his father's name and position[^98].

However, multiple investigations—including a 2020 Senate Republican inquiry led by Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley—found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden himself[^99]. By November 2023, the House Oversight Committee investigation had similarly not uncovered evidence implicating the president[^100]. In December 2024, President Biden pardoned his son, reversing his earlier statements that he would not do so and drawing criticism from both political parties[^101].

### Age and Mental Acuity Concerns

Throughout his presidency, Biden faced persistent questions about his age and mental fitness for office[^102]. At 78 when inaugurated, he was the oldest person to assume the presidency, and concerns about his stamina, occasional verbal gaffles, and physical stumbles became regular fodder for political opponents and media commentary[^103]. These concerns intensified as Biden indicated his intention to seek re-election in 2024 when he would be 81, potentially serving until age 86[^104].

### Crime Bill Legacy

Biden's authorship of the 1994 crime bill, once considered a major achievement, became a significant political liability in the context of criminal justice reform movements[^105]. Critics argued the legislation contributed to mass incarceration and disproportionately harmed Black communities through mandatory minimum sentences, the expansion of the death penalty, and the "three strikes" provision[^106]. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden expressed regret for aspects of the bill and acknowledged its unintended consequences[^107].

### Inflation and Economic Concerns

While the Biden administration pointed to strong job growth and declining unemployment, many Americans experienced economic hardship due to inflation that peaked at 9.1% in June 2022[^108]. Rising costs for groceries, gas, and housing led to diminished consumer confidence and contributed to Democratic losses in the 2022 midterm elections[^109]. Critics blamed Biden's spending policies, particularly the American Rescue Plan, for contributing to inflationary pressures[^110].

## Personal Life

Biden's personal life has been marked by profound tragedy and resilience[^111]. In 1966, he married Neilia Hunter, his first wife, while both were students[^112]. They had three children: Joseph "Beau" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina "Amy" Biden[^113]. The 1972 car accident that killed Neilia and Naomi devastated Biden, who seriously considered not taking his Senate seat[^114]. He later described this period as the darkest of his life, one where he questioned his faith and struggled to find purpose beyond caring for his surviving sons[^115].

In 1975, Biden met Jill Jacobs, a student at the University of Delaware nearly nine years his junior[^116]. Beau and Hunter encouraged their father to marry her, telling him "We think we should marry Jill"[^117]. Biden and Jill married on June 17, 1977, in a small ceremony at the United Nations chapel in New York[^118]. Jill embraced her role as stepmother to Beau and Hunter, who both came to call her "Mom"[^119]. In 1981, the couple welcomed their daughter, Ashley Blazer Biden[^120].

Tragedy struck the Biden family again in May 2015 when Beau Biden died at age 46 from glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer[^121]. Beau, who had served as Delaware Attorney General and was considered a rising political star, was diagnosed in 2013 and underwent radiation and chemotherapy before his death[^122]. Jill Biden later described the loss as "totally shattering," saying "My life changed in an instant"[^123]. Joe Biden seriously contemplated not running for president in 2016 as he grieved his son's death[^124].

Biden has been open about his Catholic faith, which has sustained him through personal tragedies[^125]. He attends Mass regularly and often speaks about how his faith informs his values and policy positions, though he has faced criticism from some Catholic leaders for his support of abortion rights[^126]. Biden is known for his empathy and personal connection with those who have experienced loss, often sharing his own experiences of grief when consoling others[^127].

Those who know Biden describe him as personable, talkative, and prone to off-the-cuff remarks that sometimes create political complications[^128]. His tendency toward verbal gaffes has been a consistent feature throughout his career, with Biden himself joking about his propensity for speaking without filters[^129]. He is known for his love of ice cream, classic cars, aviator sunglasses, and his Delaware home, where he spent most weekends during his presidency[^130].

Biden's close relationships with his family, particularly his grandchildren, have been central to his identity[^131]. He has seven grandchildren and frequently speaks about them in speeches and interviews[^132]. His sister Valerie Biden Owens has been one of his closest advisors throughout his political career, managing most of his Senate campaigns[^133].

## Legacy

Joe Biden's historical legacy remains contested and incomplete, with scholars noting that definitive assessments require the passage of time and perspective that current proximity cannot provide[^134]. However, certain elements of his political impact and historical significance are already apparent[^135].

Biden's legislative achievements during his presidency, particularly the infrastructure law, climate investments, and economic recovery measures, represent substantial policy accomplishments that may have lasting effects on American society[^136]. Ellen Fitzpatrick, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, suggests that "it is likely Joe Biden's legacy will be assessed far more generously than some would have it today," comparing his first hundred days favorably to any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt[^137]. His domestic policy achievements have been characterized by some historians as the most significant since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs[^138].

However, Biden's legacy faces significant challenges[^139]. A Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans believe Biden will be remembered as a below-average or poor president, while only 19% expect him to be remembered as outstanding or above-average—ratings similar to Richard Nixon with a net rating of -42[^140]. Russell Riley, a presidential scholar at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, noted that "single-term presidents tend to be put in the category of losers," adding that "the great marker of presidential success is serving a second term"[^141].

Many presidential historians believe Biden's legacy may be defined less by his own accomplishments than by his relationship to Donald Trump[^142]. As only the second U.S. president sandwiched between another president's non-consecutive terms (the first being Benjamin Harrison between Grover Cleveland's terms), Biden may be remembered primarily as an interregnum figure[^143]. Riley suggested Biden might be viewed as a "respite" from Trump rather than a transformative president in his own right[^144].

The circumstances surrounding Biden's decision not to seek re-election in 2024 may significantly shape historical memory[^145]. After insisting he would run again despite concerns about his age, Biden's withdrawal from the race following a poor debate performance fueled perceptions that he had stayed in politics too long[^146]. Historian Douglas Brinkley suggests that "for all his basic decency, history may come to remember Biden for hubris," with his age becoming the defining "thumbnail image" of his presidency[^147].

Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington, offered a nuanced assessment: "not enough dust has settled to render a verdict"[^148]. She compared Biden both to James K. Polk, who accomplished significant policy goals in a single term, and potentially to James Buchanan, if Biden's presidency is seen as failing to prevent subsequent damage to democratic institutions[^149].

Biden's breaking of barriers—as the first Catholic president and the oldest person to assume the presidency—represents historical significance regardless of policy assessments[^150]. His role in rebuilding international alliances, particularly through supporting Ukraine against Russian invasion, may be viewed more favorably by future historians than contemporary polling suggests[^151]. Conversely, the Afghanistan withdrawal may remain a permanent stain on his foreign policy legacy[^152].

Ultimately, Biden's legacy will likely depend on factors beyond his control, including the long-term effects of his legislation, the political trajectory of the United States in subsequent years, and whether his presidency is remembered as a successful restoration of democratic norms or a failed attempt to turn back the tide of political polarization[^153].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic scholars emphasize Biden's legislative productivity, particularly given the narrow Democratic majorities in Congress[^154]. Julian Zelizer, a Princeton historian who edited a scholarly assessment of Biden's presidency, notes that Biden successfully passed major legislation addressing infrastructure, climate change, and economic recovery during a period of intense political polarization[^155].

Ellen Fitzpatrick argues that Biden's swift action on COVID-19 upon taking office, including accelerating vaccinations and passing the American Rescue Plan, contributed to a first hundred days "more robust in achievement than perhaps any president since FDR"[^156]. The administration's success in distributing vaccines and managing the pandemic's economic fallout receives credit from public health experts and economists[^157].

Biden's defenders highlight his restoration of traditional American alliances and his leadership in organizing Western support for Ukraine following Russia's 2022 invasion[^158]. Foreign policy experts note that Biden successfully rallied NATO, expanded the alliance with Finland and Sweden joining, and maintained a unified Western front against Russian aggression without direct military confrontation[^159].

Advocates also emphasize Biden's appointments, including the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice and the most diverse cabinet and federal judiciary in American history[^160]. His administration's focus on racial equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and climate justice reflects values appreciated by progressive historians[^161].

Economists point to the strong job growth, record-low unemployment rates, and the resilience of the American economy during Biden's tenure as evidence of successful economic management[^162]. The CHIPS Act and infrastructure investments are viewed as strategic responses to competition with China and necessary modernization of American manufacturing capacity[^163].

Biden's personal character—his empathy, decency, and commitment to democratic norms—is frequently cited as a necessary antidote to his predecessor's approach[^164]. Supporters argue that Biden's steady, experienced leadership helped stabilize American politics and restore dignity to the office[^165].

### Negative Views

Critics from the right characterize Biden's presidency as a failure, pointing to the Afghanistan withdrawal as emblematic of incompetence in foreign policy[^166]. Conservative scholars and commentators argue that Biden's weakness emboldened adversaries, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increasing Chinese assertiveness cited as evidence[^167].

The Heritage Foundation and conservative think tanks blame Biden's spending policies for triggering inflation that harmed working-class Americans[^168]. They argue his regulatory approach, particularly on energy and environmental issues, constrained economic growth and contributed to high gas prices[^169].

Republican critics condemn Biden's immigration policies, noting record numbers of border crossings and characterizing his approach as abandoning border security[^170]. The administration's handling of the border crisis, particularly the separation of policy enforcement from legislative reform efforts, drew sustained criticism[^171].

Progressive critics argue that Biden failed to deliver on transformative promises, with the Build Back Better agenda largely collapsing and student loan forgiveness plans blocked by courts[^172]. Left-leaning scholars suggest Biden governed too cautiously, failing to use executive power aggressively enough to address climate change, wealth inequality, and systemic racism[^173].

Some historians note that Biden's advanced age and visible physical decline undermined his presidency and potentially his party's political prospects[^174]. His decision to seek re-election despite obvious concerns about his stamina and mental acuity drew criticism even from allies who believed he should have stepped aside earlier[^175].

Critics across the political spectrum question whether Biden's legislative achievements will prove durable, noting that future administrations may reverse his executive actions and that the implementation of major infrastructure and climate spending will take years to materialize[^176]. Skeptics argue that Biden failed to address fundamental democratic challenges, including political polarization, misinformation, and threats to voting rights[^177].

The perception that Biden may have contributed to Trump's return to power—by running again despite his age and unpopularity—may ultimately define negative historical assessments[^178]. As one columnist argued, this makes "Biden's historical legacy one of failure" regardless of his policy accomplishments[^179].
