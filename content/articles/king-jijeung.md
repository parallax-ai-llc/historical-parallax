## Summary

King Jijeung (437–514) ruled Silla from 500 to 514 CE, marking a transformative period in Korean history. He was the 22nd ruler and the first to receive the title of "king" (wang), transitioning from the earlier title of maripgan. Jijeung is remembered for strengthening royal authority, implementing groundbreaking social reforms, and building Silla into a centralized kingdom. His reign witnessed critical reforms including the abolition of human sacrifice, the formal establishment of Silla's name, territorial expansion, and agricultural innovations that propelled the kingdom toward becoming a major power in the Korean peninsula.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

King Jijeung was born in 437 CE into Silla's royal lineage during a period when the kingdom was relatively weak compared to its rivals, Goguryeo and Baekje.[^3] Like many Silla kings, Jijeung was of royal blood on both sides. His father was Kim Seup-bo, known as Galmunwang, who was a grandson of Naemul Isageum, a prominent early Silla ruler.[^4] His mother was Lady Josaeng, the daughter of Nulji Isageum (King Nulji), which gave him legitimacy through the maternal line, a significant factor in Silla's succession practices.[^5]

Growing up in the royal court, Jijeung would have been exposed to the political complexities of a kingdom struggling to assert itself among the Three Kingdoms of Korea. His mother's lineage was particularly significant as King Nulji's reign had seen the acceptance of Buddhism into the royal family, exposing Jijeung to Buddhist influences from an early age.[^6] This early exposure would later shape his pro-Buddhist tendencies and influence his policy decisions.

The young prince witnessed Silla's challenges during the reigns of his predecessors. When King Soji died without a son to inherit the throne, the succession became uncertain. At the age of 63, Jijeung was selected as the closest relative to succeed to the throne, primarily because he was the son of King Nulji's daughter.[^7] However, his path to the throne was not smooth. Historical records indicate that for the first four years after his accession, Jijeung was referred to as "King Galmun" rather than by his temple name, suggesting significant political resistance to his succession.[^8] His ascension to the throne at such an advanced age after the death of the young King Soji was ultimately achieved with the help of the Park clan, whose support would prove crucial throughout his reign.[^9]

---

## Rise to Power

King Jijeung's rise to power in 500 CE came during a critical juncture in Silla's history. The kingdom faced internal political instability following King Soji's death without an heir, creating a succession crisis that Jijeung navigated through strategic alliances and his dual royal lineage.[^10] His advanced age of 63 at accession, unusual for Korean monarchs, actually worked to his advantage by presenting him as a mature, stabilizing figure during uncertain times.

To consolidate his position, Jijeung formed a crucial marriage alliance with Queen Yeonje of the Miryang Park clan (also referred to as the Moryang-bu Park clan).[^11] This alliance was politically astute for multiple reasons. The Park clan was a pro-Buddhist force in Silla society, and through this marriage, Jijeung was able to solidify his legitimacy through the Singung rites and gain broader acceptance of his succession.[^12] The Park clan's support proved transformative, as from his reign through those of his son Beopheung, grandson Jinheung, and great-grandson Jinji, Park clan queens suddenly became prominent in Silla's royal lineage.[^13]

Jijeung's early reign focused on establishing his authority and transforming Silla's governmental structure. On the contemporary Naengsuri Silla monument, his name was inscribed as "Jidoro," providing archaeological evidence of his rule.[^14] The Stone monument of Naengsu-ri also reveals that he was referred to as "King Galmun" until four years after his accession, confirming that his succession faced initial resistance that he gradually overcame through political skill and reform.[^15]

His consolidation of power coincided with Silla's broader transformation from a loose confederation into a centralized kingdom. During the reigns of King Jijeung, King Beopheung, and King Jinheung, Silla was clearly transformed into a centralized ancient state, with Jijeung laying the critical groundwork for this evolution.[^16] His pro-Buddhist tendencies, influenced by his mother who had experienced royal worship of Buddhism during King Nulji's reign, also helped improve Silla's relationship with the Buddhist kingdom of Goguryeo, changing perceptions of both Goguryeo and Buddhism in Silla society.[^17]

## Major Achievements

King Jijeung's reign from 500 to 514 CE was marked by sweeping reforms and achievements that fundamentally transformed Silla from a tribal confederation into a centralized kingdom, establishing foundations that would enable Silla to eventually unify the Korean peninsula.

### Administrative and Political Reforms

In 503 CE, King Jijeung implemented perhaps his most symbolically important reform by formally establishing the country's name as "Silla," standardizing the Chinese characters 新羅.[^18] The kingdom had previously been represented by various Chinese characters including "Saroguk," making this standardization a critical step in establishing national identity.[^19] Simultaneously, he took the Chinese-style title of "wang" (王), meaning "king," replacing the native Silla title of "maripgan" that had been used since the reign of Naemul Maripgan.[^20] This transition marked Silla's adoption of Chinese governmental and cultural practices, signaling its emergence as a sophisticated centralized state.[^21]

The following year, in 504, Jijeung reformed ceremonial dress codes, standardizing court protocol and reinforcing hierarchical structures.[^22] In 505, he conducted a comprehensive reform of local administration, incorporating the old territory of Siljik-guk into the Silla administrative system and establishing Siljik Province (Siljikju), encompassing modern-day Samcheok in Gangwon Province, with General Isabu as its inaugural governor.[^23] During his reign, Silla reorganized its administrative zones, including the capital, creating a more efficient bureaucratic structure.[^24]

### Social and Humanitarian Reforms

Jijeung's most morally significant achievement came in 502 CE when he officially banned the practice of sunjang—the burial of living servants with deceased masters.[^25] This ancient practice of human sacrifice had been deeply embedded in Silla's elite culture, with archaeological evidence confirming that servants were buried alive with deceased elites in elaborate tomb complexes.[^26] The Samguk Sagi (Chronicles of the Three States) records this prohibition, and recent archaeological discoveries have provided skeletal evidence of the practice that Jijeung courageously ended.[^27] This reform was influenced by his pro-Buddhist tendencies, as Buddhism opposed such practices, demonstrating how religious and moral considerations shaped his governance.[^28]

### Economic and Agricultural Development

Silla prospered during Jijeung's reign with greater agricultural yields coming from the introduction of oxen-drawn ploughs and irrigation systems.[^29] These technological advancements in agriculture resulted in significant social and cultural developments throughout Silla society.[^30] In 509, he established the Dongsi (East Market) in eastern Gyeongju, creating a permanent commercial center that stimulated economic growth and trade.[^31] The kingdom benefitted from natural resources such as iron and gold, with Silla-manufactured goods including silks, leather products, furniture, ceramics, and metal tools and weapons, all supervised by dedicated government departments.[^32]

### Military Expansion and Territorial Conquest

In 512, King Jijeung authorized one of Silla's most significant early territorial expansions by sending General Kim Isabu to conquer Usan-guk, a tribal confederation centered on Ulleungdo and nearby islets (including modern-day Dokdo Islands) in the East Sea.[^33] Silla's inland regions had frequently suffered from piracy by Usan-guk's people, who believed the harsh geographical conditions of their island would prevent Silla from invading.[^34] Isabu employed an ingenious psychological warfare tactic, loading large wooden lions onto battle ships and threatening to release them if the islanders didn't surrender.[^35] The trick worked, and Usan-guk surrendered without bloodshed, becoming Silla's first overseas dominion and providing annual tribute of marine goods such as abalone and seaweed.[^36]

### Religious and Cultural Legacy

While Buddhism was not officially recognized until his successor King Beopheung's reign in 527-528 CE, Jijeung laid crucial groundwork for this development.[^37] His pro-Buddhist tendencies, inherited from his mother and reinforced by his marriage to Queen Yeonje of the pro-Buddhist Park clan, gradually changed perceptions of Buddhism in Silla society.[^38] His improved relationship with Goguryeo, influenced by these Buddhist sympathies, contributed to changing attitudes toward both Goguryeo and Buddhism among Silla's elite.[^39] Their son, King Beopheung, was influenced by these pro-Buddhist parents and successfully insisted on Buddhism's official recognition.[^40]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, King Jijeung's reign was not without controversies and criticisms, both contemporary and historical.

### Contested Succession and Political Instability

Jijeung's succession to the throne remains one of the most controversial aspects of his legacy. At 63 years old when he ascended in 500 CE, he was extraordinarily old by the standards of the time.[^41] The Stone monument of Naengsu-ri reveals that he was referred to as "King Galmun" for the first four years after his accession rather than by his proper title, suggesting his succession was not smooth and faced significant opposition.[^42] After King Soji's death without a son, Jijeung's claim to the throne, while based on being King Nulji's grandson through his mother, was not universally accepted, and he required the Park clan's political support to secure his position.[^43]

His ascension represented a shift in power dynamics within Silla's aristocracy, and some historians argue that his advanced age and reliance on the Park clan created a precedent for powerful aristocratic families to influence royal succession, potentially weakening the monarchy's independent authority in the long term.[^44]

### Limited Military Achievements

While the conquest of Usan-guk in 512 was significant, critics note that compared to his successors—particularly his grandson King Jinheung who massively expanded Silla's territory—Jijeung's military achievements were relatively modest.[^45] During his reign, Silla remained the weakest of the Three Kingdoms, with a population of approximately 850,000 people (170,000 households), significantly smaller than Baekje's 3,800,000 people and Goguryeo's 3,500,000 people.[^46] Goguryeo controlled the northern half of the peninsula plus Liaodong Peninsula and Manchuria, while Paekche and Silla occupied the southern half, with Silla in the most vulnerable position.[^47]

Some historians argue that Jijeung's focus on internal administrative reforms, while valuable, came at the expense of military preparedness and territorial expansion that might have better positioned Silla against its rivals during his lifetime.[^48]

### Incomplete Buddhist Reform

While Jijeung's pro-Buddhist tendencies influenced important social reforms like the abolition of sunjang, he never officially recognized Buddhism as the state religion, a step his son Beopheung accomplished in 527-528 CE.[^49] Some scholars suggest this hesitation reflected either political weakness or insufficient commitment to the religious transformation he personally favored. The delay in official recognition, despite the royal family's private Buddhist sympathies, may have reflected resistance from conservative aristocratic factions that Jijeung was unable or unwilling to overcome.[^50]

### Dependence on the Park Clan Alliance

Jijeung's marriage to Queen Yeonje of the Park clan and his reliance on Park clan support for his succession created a pattern of Park clan queens that continued for several generations.[^51] While politically expedient, this dependence arguably constrained royal autonomy and established aristocratic influence over the throne that would complicate Silla's political dynamics in subsequent reigns. Critics suggest that this set a precedent for aristocratic families to view the throne as requiring their approval and support, rather than being an independent source of authority.[^52]

---

## Personal Life

King Jijeung's personal life was deeply intertwined with the political and religious transformations of his era, reflecting the complexities of Silla's royal court during the early 6th century.

### Family and Marriage

Jijeung married Queen Yeonje (also called Queen Yeongje) of the Miryang Park clan (Moryang-bu Park clan), a union that was as much political as personal.[^53] The Park clan was a powerful pro-Buddhist force in Silla society, and this marriage alliance was crucial for Jijeung's political consolidation.[^54] Through the Singung rites performed with the queen, Jijeung was able to legitimize his succession to the throne and strengthen his bond with one of Silla's most influential aristocratic families.[^55]

Together, they had at least one son, Kim Wongjong, who would succeed him as King Beopheung (r. 514-540).[^56] Their family life appears to have been characterized by shared Buddhist sympathies. Both Jijeung and Queen Yeonje influenced their son toward Buddhism, and King Beopheung would insist on the official recognition of Buddhism during his reign, finally achieving it in 527-528 CE.[^57] This suggests that Jijeung's household was a center of Buddhist learning and practice, even before the religion's official acceptance.

### Religious Beliefs and Influences

Jijeung's pro-Buddhist tendencies were shaped by both his mother and his wife.[^58] His mother, Lady Josaeng, was King Nulji's daughter who had experienced royal worship of Buddhism, exposing Jijeung to Buddhist practices from childhood.[^59] His marriage to the pro-Buddhist Queen Yeonje further reinforced these inclinations.[^60] While he never officially recognized Buddhism as state religion—likely due to political constraints from conservative aristocratic factions—his personal beliefs influenced significant policy decisions, particularly the 502 CE prohibition of sunjang (human sacrifice in burials).[^61]

### Character and Governance Style

Jijeung's ascension to the throne at the unusually advanced age of 63 suggests a personality marked by patience, political acumen, and perhaps ambition that endured despite decades of waiting for power.[^62] His willingness to implement sweeping reforms immediately upon taking the throne—the sunjang prohibition in 502, the Silla name standardization in 503, ceremonial reforms in 504, and administrative reorganization in 505—reveals a ruler who had carefully considered his vision for the kingdom long before gaining the authority to implement it.[^63]

His governance style appears to have balanced pragmatism with principle. While personally sympathetic to Buddhism, he pragmatically avoided official recognition that might have provoked aristocratic opposition. Yet he courageously banned the deeply entrenched practice of human sacrifice, demonstrating moral conviction when he believed the cause warranted the risk.[^64]

### Life in the Royal Court

As king, Jijeung would have resided in Silla's capital of Gyeongju (then called Seorabeol), which by his reign was developing into a significant urban center.[^65] The establishment of the East Market in 509 suggests his involvement in the capital's commercial development.[^66] His court saw the implementation of new ceremonial dress codes in 504, indicating attention to ritual and protocol that reinforced royal dignity and hierarchical social structures.[^67]

### Death and Burial

King Jijeung died in 514 CE at the age of 77, after a 14-year reign.[^68] After his death, he received a temple name—the name by which he is now known—becoming the first Silla king to receive this posthumous honor.[^69] This innovation established a precedent, as every subsequent Silla monarch was given the title of wang with two characters in posthumous names.[^70]

His tomb is believed to be Cheonmachong (Heavenly Horse Tomb), located in Gyeongju inside the tomb complex Daereungwon, though this identification remains debated among scholars.[^71] The tomb was excavated from April to December 1973, yielding 11,500 artifacts including a gold crown and gold girdle replete with jade comma-shaped beads, indicating a king was buried there.[^72] The excavation report identified the occupant as King Jijeung, though some scholars suggest it could be his younger brother, based on the tomb's size and relationship to the nearby Hwangnamdae-chong.[^73] The question of the tomb's true occupant remains unresolved, though the Cheonmachong attribution continues to be the most widely accepted theory.[^74]

## Legacy

King Jijeung's legacy extends far beyond his 14-year reign, establishing foundations that enabled Silla's eventual unification of the Korean peninsula and leaving lasting impacts on Korean political, social, and religious development.

### Foundation of Silla's Centralized State

Jijeung's most enduring legacy was transforming Silla from a loose tribal confederation into a centralized kingdom. Through the reigns of King Jijeung, King Beopheung, and King Jinheung, Silla was clearly transformed into a centralized ancient state, with Jijeung laying the critical groundwork.[^75] His administrative reforms of 503-505—establishing the name "Silla," adopting the wang title, reorganizing provincial administration, and incorporating territories like Siljik-guk—created the bureaucratic infrastructure that his successors built upon.[^76]

By the time of King Beopheung, Silla was a full-fledged kingdom with Buddhism as state religion and its own era name systems, achievements made possible by Jijeung's foundational work.[^77] The governmental and social reforms were fully in place with a centralized aristocratic state by Beopheung's reign, demonstrating how effectively Jijeung's vision was realized.[^78]

### Pioneer of Social and Humanitarian Reform

Jijeung's 502 CE prohibition of sunjang represents one of the earliest documented instances of a Korean ruler abolishing a cruel traditional practice on humanitarian grounds.[^79] This reform, influenced by Buddhist ethics, established a precedent for religion-inspired social justice that would characterize much of Silla's later development. Archaeological evidence confirms that the practice ended following his decree, demonstrating his authority's effectiveness and the reform's lasting impact.[^80]

### Facilitator of Buddhism's Official Recognition

While Buddhism was not officially recognized until his son Beopheung's reign in 527-528 CE, Jijeung's role in preparing Silla society for this transformation was crucial.[^81] His improved relationship with Goguryeo, influenced by pro-Buddhist tendencies, contributed to changing perceptions of both Goguryeo and Buddhism in Silla society.[^82] His marriage to the pro-Buddhist Park clan queen and their raising of a Buddhist-sympathetic heir created the political and cultural conditions necessary for official recognition.[^83] Without Jijeung's groundwork, the sudden official adoption of Buddhism might have faced insurmountable resistance.

### Establishment of Royal Naming Conventions

As the first Silla king to receive a temple name posthumously, Jijeung established a convention that would continue throughout Silla's history.[^84] Every subsequent Silla monarch received the title of wang with two characters in posthumous names, a practice directly traceable to the precedent he set.[^85] This seemingly minor administrative detail reflected Silla's broader adoption of Chinese governmental practices and contributed to the kingdom's cultural sophistication.

### Territorial Expansion and Maritime Power

The 512 CE conquest of Usan-guk established Silla's first overseas dominion, marking the kingdom's emergence as a maritime power capable of projecting force beyond the peninsula.[^86] The incorporation of Ulleungdo and Dokdo into Silla's territory, with annual tribute of marine goods, created economic benefits and established territorial claims that continue to hold significance in modern Korean history.[^87]

### Agricultural and Economic Development

The agricultural innovations during Jijeung's reign—introduction of oxen-drawn ploughs and irrigation systems—resulted in social and cultural developments that propelled Silla's prosperity.[^88] These advancements in agricultural technology contributed to population growth and economic expansion that enabled Silla's later military successes.[^89] The establishment of the East Market in Gyeongju in 509 created a commercial infrastructure that would eventually make the capital a hub for travelers by land and sea.[^90]

### Modern Historical Assessment

Modern Korean historians view Jijeung as a transitional ruler who modernized Silla through agricultural innovation, political reforms, and diplomatic improvements, setting foundations for the kingdom's later expansion and cultural flourishing.[^91] His reign represents a pivotal moment when Silla transformed from a relatively weak southeastern Korean kingdom into a centralized state capable of eventually unifying the peninsula. The fact that a 2022 academic study continues to analyze his reign's political and social background demonstrates his enduring relevance to understanding Korean state formation.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who emphasize Jijeung's positive contributions view him as a visionary reformer who fundamentally transformed Silla during a critical period. The World History Encyclopedia describes him as a ruler "remembered for strengthening royal authority and building Silla into a centralized kingdom," highlighting his nation-building achievements.[^93] His comprehensive reform program—implemented systematically from 502 through 512—demonstrates remarkable planning and political skill, particularly given the contested nature of his succession.[^94]

Historians particularly praise his humanitarian reforms, with the prohibition of sunjang representing an early example of a Korean ruler prioritizing ethical principles over entrenched aristocratic traditions.[^95] The fact that archaeological evidence confirms the practice ended following his decree demonstrates both his moral courage and political effectiveness.[^96] His willingness to challenge powerful interests by banning human sacrifice, while balancing this with pragmatic restraint in officially recognizing Buddhism, reveals sophisticated political judgment.[^97]

Scholars also credit Jijeung with laying critical groundwork for Silla's eventual unification of the Korean peninsula. As noted by Korea.net, "Through the reigns of King Jijeung, King Beopheung, and King Jinheung, Silla was clearly transformed into a centralized ancient state," with Jijeung's foundational reforms enabling his successors' more dramatic expansions.[^98] The administrative infrastructure he created—provincial reorganization, the wang title system, standardized nomenclature—provided the bureaucratic capacity necessary for managing a larger, more complex state.[^99]

His agricultural and economic policies receive particular praise. The introduction of oxen-drawn ploughs and irrigation systems "resulted in social and cultural developments and reforms in Silla society," according to multiple historical sources, demonstrating how technological innovation can drive broader societal transformation.[^100] The establishment of the East Market in 509 showed foresight in developing commercial infrastructure that would benefit Silla for centuries.[^101]

Contemporary scholarship, including a 2022 Korean academic study on "The emergence of King Jijeung lineage and the political and social background of recognition of Buddhism in Silla," continues to analyze his reign's significance, suggesting his diplomatic and religious policies had lasting impacts on Korean state formation and cultural development.[^102] Scholars emphasize how his improved relations with Goguryeo, facilitated by shared Buddhist sympathies, changed perceptions and created conditions for Silla's later diplomatic and military successes.[^103]

The Dale's Korean Temple Adventures historical analysis notes that he "oversaw a period of prosperity for Silla," directly connecting his reign to economic growth and social stability.[^104] His legacy as the first king to receive a temple name posthumously is viewed as establishing important precedents for royal dignity and bureaucratic consistency.[^105]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars question whether Jijeung's achievements have been overstated relative to his more militarily successful successors, particularly King Jinheung, who massively expanded Silla's territory.[^106] While Jijeung conquered only the small island nation of Usan-guk, Jinheung would seize the Han River region and expand Silla into a major power, leading some historians to view Jijeung's reign as merely preparatory rather than transformative in itself.[^107]

The circumstances of his succession remain controversial. The Naengsu-ri monument evidence showing he was called "King Galmun" for four years after accession suggests significant opposition and questionable legitimacy.[^108] Critics argue that ascending to the throne at 63 through Park clan support, rather than clear hereditary right, may have established problematic precedents for aristocratic influence over royal succession.[^109] This dependence on the Park clan—evidenced by the sudden prominence of Park clan queens in subsequent reigns—potentially weakened the monarchy's independent authority.[^110]

Some scholars criticize Jijeung's military record, noting that Silla remained the weakest of the Three Kingdoms throughout his reign, with a population less than one-quarter that of Baekje or Goguryeo.[^111] The focus on internal administrative reforms, while creating useful bureaucratic infrastructure, arguably left Silla vulnerable to its rivals. Critics suggest a more militarily aggressive ruler might have better positioned Silla during this period when Goguryeo and Baekje were also consolidating power.[^112]

His religious policy draws mixed assessments. While personally pro-Buddhist and implementing Buddhism-inspired reforms like the sunjang prohibition, his failure to officially recognize Buddhism—a step accomplished by his son—suggests either political weakness or insufficient commitment.[^113] Conservative critics of rapid Buddhicization might view this hesitation positively, but reformist scholars see it as a missed opportunity to accelerate Silla's cultural and diplomatic development.[^114]

The debate over his tomb's identification reflects broader uncertainties about his historical legacy. That scholars cannot definitively confirm whether Cheonmachong is truly his burial site, with some suggesting it belongs to his brother, indicates how limited contemporary evidence about his reign remains.[^115] This uncertainty complicates efforts to fully understand his historical significance and assess his accomplishments.
