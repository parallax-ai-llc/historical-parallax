## Summary

Matthias Schleiden was a German botanist who co-founded cell theory with Theodor Schwann. In 1838, he proposed that all plant tissues are composed of cells and that cells are the basic unit of all plant matter. Together with Schwann's work on animal cells, this established cell theory as a fundamental principle of biology.
