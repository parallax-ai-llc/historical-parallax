## Summary

Philip Green built a retail empire that included Topshop, Topman, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, and BHS in the United Kingdom. His Arcadia Group was one of Britain's largest fashion retailers. He was knighted in 2006 but faced criticism for asset stripping, particularly when BHS collapsed leaving a pension deficit. His business reputation was severely damaged by allegations of harassment and the collapse of Arcadia in 2020.
