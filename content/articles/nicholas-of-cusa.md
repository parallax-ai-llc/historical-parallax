## Summary

Nicholas of Cusa was a German cardinal, philosopher, and theologian who was one of the most original thinkers of the late Middle Ages. His major work De Docta Ignorantia (On Learned Ignorance) argued that human knowledge of God is always limited and that God can best be known through recognizing the limits of human understanding. He anticipated many modern ideas about the relativity of knowledge and the infinity of the universe.
