## Summary

Lê Duẩn (1907-1986) was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam from 1960 until his death in 1986, making him one of the most powerful Vietnamese leaders of the 20th century[^1]. Though less known to Western audiences than Ho Chi Minh or Vo Nguyen Giap, Le Duan was arguably the chief architect of North Vietnam's military strategy during the Vietnam War and the driving force behind the country's reunification in 1975[^2]. After Ho Chi Minh's death in 1969, he became the undisputed leader of North Vietnam and subsequently ruled the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam through a turbulent period marked by military victories, economic failures, and regional conflicts[^3]. His legacy remains deeply contested, celebrated by some as the great architect of national reunification while criticized by others for his rigid economic policies, political repression, and the humanitarian crises that emerged under his rule[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Lê Duẩn was born as Lê Văn Nhuận on April 7, 1907, in Bich La village, Triệu Đông, Triệu Phong district, Quảng Trị Province, in the Annam Protectorate of French Indochina[^5]. He was born into a family of five children, the son of Le Hiep and Vo Thi Dao[^6]. There remains considerable debate among historians about his actual family background. Le Duan himself claimed to have been born into a poor peasant family, and in writings and interviews he stressed that his childhood was one of poverty and despair, which he cited as the main reason he became committed to communism at a young age[^7].

However, historians have questioned this narrative, suspecting that he actually came from a middle-class family. This suspicion arises from the fact that he clearly received a good education in French-speaking schools[^8]. Le Duan received a French colonial education, probably through the entire lycée (high school) system[^9]. Such education was open only to upper-class youths or those with special French connections, and even then perhaps only one out of a hundred Vietnamese youth were ever admitted, virtually none of them poor village youths[^10]. Some local sources from his generation claim that Duan's parents were metal scrap collectors and blacksmiths, while other accounts describe his father as a railway clerk[^11].

Before entering revolutionary politics, Le Duan worked as a clerk for the Vietnam Railway Company in Hanoi during the 1920s[^12]. It was during this period, through his work environment and exposure to urban revolutionary circles, that he educated himself in Marxist theory and first came into contact with revolutionary thought[^13]. This formative period in Hanoi, where he witnessed colonial exploitation firsthand, proved instrumental in shaping his political consciousness and commitment to revolutionary change.

In 1928, Le Duan became a member of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League, marking the beginning of his formal involvement in the communist movement[^14]. Just two years later, in 1930, he became a co-founder of the Indochina Communist Party, which would later become the Communist Party of Vietnam[^15]. His early revolutionary activism came at a considerable personal cost. In 1931, just one year after helping to found the party, he was arrested by French colonial authorities and imprisoned[^16]. He would spend the next six years behind bars, not being released until 1937[^17]. This experience of imprisonment and suffering for the revolutionary cause became a defining element of his political identity and strengthened his commitment to the communist movement.

## Rise to Power

Upon his release from prison in 1937, Le Duan quickly advanced in the party hierarchy. At the 2nd National Congress, which took place between 1937 and 1939, he joined the party's Central Committee, marking his emergence as a significant figure within the communist leadership[^18]. During the First Indochina War against French colonial forces (1946-1954), Le Duan distinguished himself as an active and effective revolutionary leader in South Vietnam[^19]. From 1951 until 1954, he headed the Central Office of South Vietnam, a crucial Party organ responsible for coordinating communist activities in the southern provinces[^20].

In 1950, he was sent to the southern provinces of Vietnam as the main representative of the Communists, where he built a substantial political following in the South that would become critically important to his later ascent to power[^21]. This southern power base set him apart from other northern-based leaders and gave him unique insights into the situation in South Vietnam that would prove invaluable in shaping party strategy.

Le Duan's real rise to party power came in late 1956 with the disgrace and fall of Truong Chinh, who had been Party Secretary General but had directed a disastrous land reform movement in North Vietnam[^22]. Significantly, Le Duan was "the only official not tainted with the land reform disaster," which helped position him as an acceptable alternative leader[^23]. In 1956, following Truong Chinh's removal, Le Duan was promoted to the daily administration of North Vietnam's Communist Party[^24]. He became acting secretary general of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, with Ho Chi Minh holding the official title but leaving the actual job increasingly to Le Duan[^25].

By the mid-to-late 1950s, Le Duan had become the second-most powerful policy-maker within the Party, eclipsing former Party First Secretary Truong Chinh and other rivals[^26]. In 1958, he made a secret visit to South Vietnam, after which he wrote an influential report titled "The Path to Revolution in the South"[^27]. In this document, he argued that North Vietnam had to do more to assist southern communist fighters and advocated for a more aggressive approach toward reunification[^28]. This report would prove instrumental in shifting party policy toward armed struggle in the South.

Le Duan was informally chosen as the First Secretary of the party by Ho Chi Minh in 1959 at the January plenum of the Central Committee, and was elected to the post de jure at the 3rd National Congress in 1960[^29]. According to Bui Tin, a prominent Vietnamese journalist and former colonel, Le Duan was not Ho's original choice for the post; Ho's preferred candidate was Vo Nguyen Giap, but since Le Duan was supported by the influential Le Duc Tho, the Head of the Party Organisational Department, Le Duan was picked for the post[^30]. This alliance with Le Duc Tho would prove crucial to Le Duan's consolidation of power and his ability to implement his preferred policies over the following decades.

## Major Achievements

### Architect of the National Liberation Front

During the late 1950s, Le Duan became increasingly aggressive in his advocacy for armed struggle in South Vietnam[^31]. In 1959, Ho Chi Minh sent Le Duan, a trusted adviser, to visit South Vietnam, and upon his return, Le Duan informed his leader that President Ngo Dinh Diem's policy of imprisoning opposition leaders was so successful that unless North Vietnam encouraged armed resistance, a united country would never be achieved[^32]. This assessment proved pivotal in changing North Vietnamese strategy.

Ho Chi Minh, influenced by Le Duan's report, agreed to supply the guerrilla units with aid and encouraged the different armed groups to join together to form a more powerful resistance organization[^33]. In December 1960, the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), commonly known as the Viet Cong, was formed[^34]. The party leadership in Hanoi included several southerners, like Le Duan – the party's general secretary – who favored armed rebellion to liberate Vietnam south of the 17th parallel and to reunify the country under the socialist banner[^35].

Le Duan was the mastermind behind the guerrilla organization known as the Viet Cong and played a directing role in its early operations[^36]. After Vietnam's division in 1954, Le Duan was put in charge of establishing an underground Communist Party organization in South Vietnam, and he oversaw the creation in 1962 of the People's Revolutionary Party, a crucial component of the National Liberation Front[^37]. The Viet Cong's campaign of insurgency, assassinations, and terrorism in 1959-61 was directed chiefly by Le Duan[^38].

### Leadership During the Vietnam War

More militant than Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap, Le Duan pushed forcefully for a "war of reunification" against the Ngo Dinh Diem government in Saigon and its American backers[^39]. In January 1959, under increasing pressure from southern communist cadres and with Le Duan's strong advocacy, the Central Committee in Hanoi approved plans for North Vietnam to fully support the effort to overthrow the South Vietnamese government and reunify Vietnam under a communist government[^40].

From the 3rd National Party Congress in 1960, as First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, Le Duan directly led and oversaw the entire resistance war against the United States[^41]. Historian Pierre Asselin has written that among the key figures in Hanoi, it was Le Duan who most strongly advocated for war, insisting that armed struggle was the principal means to reunify the country, and his influence on strategic planning during the war against the United States was unparalleled[^42]. Scholar Mark Atwood Lawrence noted that Le Duan, more than any other Vietnamese leader, was the true architect of Vietnam's revolutionary victory[^43].

Le Duan and Le Duc Tho emerged as the most influential "South-firsters" who believed that reunification with the South should be a higher priority than modernizing the North, and they accepted the loss of northern blood and treasure toward that goal[^44]. This strategic orientation shaped North Vietnam's conduct of the war and its willingness to sustain enormous casualties in pursuit of reunification.

When Ho Chi Minh's health began to fail in 1964, Le Duan, as his trusted underling, more visibly took on day-to-day decision-making responsibilities[^45]. Following Ho's death in 1969, Le Duan assumed full leadership of North Vietnam and consolidated his power to become the undisputed leader[^46]. Within the first few years of his tenure as general secretary, Le Duan successfully emerged as the ultimate source of authority in North Vietnam[^47].

### Achievement of Reunification

Le Duan pursued the Vietnam War until its victorious conclusion in 1975[^48]. The strategic course he set reached its climax in the Spring 1975 General Offensive and Uprising, culminating in complete victory, the liberation of the South, and national reunification[^49]. On April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese forces captured Saigon, bringing an end to the Vietnam War and achieving the goal that Le Duan had long pursued.

When South Vietnam was reunited with North Vietnam in 1976, he assumed the new title of General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, leading the newly unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam[^50]. In May 1975, celebrating the victory over South Vietnam, Le Duan declared the triumph in "completely defeating the war of aggression and the neo-colonialist rule of US imperialism"[^51]. At the 10th Conference of the Central Committee in 1981, Le Duan explained: "We won against the US because our party had a correct and creative revolutionary line, and method. The revolutionary line is to raise the two banners of national independence and socialism. That is the source of all the strength of our revolution"[^52].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Economic Policy Failures and the Subsidy Period

Though adept at party organizing and mobilizing human resources in pursuit of victory during the Vietnam War, Le Duan proved far less pragmatic afterward as a maker of peacetime economic and foreign policy[^53]. Hard-liners, led by Le Duan, insisted that South Vietnam's business and farming communities must adapt to the strict socialist system of North Vietnam, rejecting the advice of moderate Communist officials who warned against imposing a command economic system on the South[^54].

Le Duan's policies and foreign wars led to an abrupt decline in the standard of living; monthly per capita income in the North declined from $82 in 1976 to $58 in 1980[^55]. The period between 1975 and 1985 became known as the "subsidy time" because government subsidies barely kept millions alive, and it is estimated that during this period, 70 percent of Vietnam's population lived below the poverty line[^56]. After reunification into a unified communist state in 1976, the economy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was plagued by enormous difficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in distribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt problems[^57].

The collectivization process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978[^58]. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives established during the Second Five-Year Plan had collapsed in the South by 1980[^59]. During the Second Five-Year Plan, industry grew just 0.1 percent[^60]. In practice, Lê Duẩn prioritized heavy industry: 21.4% of state investment was in heavy industry in the Second Five-Year Plan and 29.7 percent in the Third Five-Year Plan (1981–85), even as consumer goods and agricultural production collapsed[^61].

By 1986, annual inflation rates had reached 100 percent, and virtually all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were operating in the red[^62]. In the years immediately prior to the Đổi Mới Reforms, Vietnam faced an economic crisis; inflation soared to over 700 percent, economic growth slowed down, and export revenues covered less than the total value of imports[^63]. The economy's over-reliance on subsidies and aids from the Soviet Union and countries in the Comecon bloc to resolve its foreign exchange gap problem (during 1986-1988 aids were used to pay for 62 per cent of Vietnam's import) resulted in exacerbating imbalance of payments and budget deficits[^64].

Beginning in 1979, Le Duan acknowledged that economic policy mistakes had been made by the national Party and State leadership[^65]. In his report to the 5th National Congress in 1982, Le Duan admitted that the Second Five-Year Plan had been a failure economically[^66]. Following his death, the Politburo promptly (though discreetly) denounced Le Duan's administration as managerially incompetent and his southern economic policies as ineffectual[^67]. Le Duan's post-1975 policies worked out "not at all," with popular discontent growing and the Vietnamese economy grinding to a near halt by late 1979[^68].

### Re-education Camps and Political Repression

Lê Duẩn, who led the Vietnamese Communist Party, purged South Vietnamese who had fought against the North after reunification in 1976, imprisoning up to 300,000 people in re-education camps[^69]. Following their victory, Lê Duẩn and his colleagues planned to reeducate segments of the southern population thought to be tainted by American influence, with close to one million people entering the camps to learn "the beauty" of Marxism[^70].

After the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese men, from former officers in the armed forces to religious leaders to employees of the Americans or the old government, were rounded up[^71]. The government imprisoned at least 200,000-300,000 former military officers, government workers and supporters, though other estimates put the number as high as 500,000 to 1 million[^72]. Prisoners were kept on a starvation diet, overworked and harshly punished, with cases where prisoners were beaten to death, confined to dark cells, or executed for attempting escape[^73]. Prisoners were incarcerated for periods ranging from weeks to 18 years[^74].

The story of the political rise of Le Duan and Le Duc Tho includes the police state they and their comrades built in the North to solidify their power and suppress dissent[^75]. Le Duan held the daily levers of power, including internal security, by means of which he established an effective police state in North Vietnam[^76]. Some historians' sympathies lie with the "North-first" intellectuals and politicians who were victims of Le Duan's repressive police state, and with the people of North Vietnam who suffered continuous bombings and the diversion of precious resources toward the war effort[^77].

### The Boat People Crisis

Between 1975 and 1992, almost two million Vietnamese risked their lives to flee oppression and hardship after the Vietnam War, in one of the largest mass exoduses in modern history[^78]. Between 1975 and 1995, almost 800,000 boat people who left Vietnam arrived safely in another country, but tragically, between 200,000 and 250,000 boat people died at sea, according to UNHCR estimates[^79]. Although a few thousand people had fled Vietnam by boat between 1975 and mid-1978, the exodus of the boat people began in September 1978, hitting its highest point in 1979[^80].

The Vietnamese government, under Le Duan's leadership, began to institute socialist reforms by the late 1970s, including the confiscation of businesses and farmland, with many ethnic Chinese business owners who had lived in southern Vietnam for generations coming under attack and officially encouraged to leave the country[^81]. More than a million people were placed in 're-education camps,' with many dying while tens of thousands were left in anguish in detention until the late 1980s[^82]. These policies created conditions that forced hundreds of thousands to risk their lives at sea to escape Vietnam.

### Military Adventurism: Cambodia and China

After the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, Le Duan led the party through a difficult period that witnessed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the country's break with China and the expulsion of much of its ethnic Chinese community[^83]. In a private meeting with the Soviet ambassador to Vietnam on November 16, 1976, Lê Duẩn dismissed both Ieng Sary and Pol Pot as "bad people" for their pro-Chinese policies, calling the regime existing in Democratic Kampuchea "slavery communism"[^84].

By the end of 1978, Vietnamese leaders decided to remove the Khmer Rouge-dominated government of Democratic Kampuchea, perceiving it as being pro-Chinese and hostile towards Vietnam[^85]. On December 25, 1978, 150,000 Vietnamese troops invaded Democratic Kampuchea and overran the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army in just two weeks, thereby ending Pol Pot's government[^86]. This invasion, while ending the Cambodian genocide, also led to a decade-long Vietnamese occupation and international isolation.

Le Duan's alignment with the Soviet Union and invasion of Cambodia provoked a response from China. Le Duan visited China from November 20-25, 1977 to seek aid, but CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng stated that Sino-Vietnamese relations had deteriorated because they held different principles[^87]. In 1979, in the midst of the heating Sino-Vietnamese conflict, Le Duan delivered a speech accusing China of plotting to invade Vietnam, starting with charging Zhou Enlai of dividing Vietnam into two parts at the Geneva Conference[^88].

On February 17, 1979, the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Vietnamese border in what became known as the Sino-Vietnamese War, withdrawing on March 5 after a two-week campaign which devastated northern Vietnam and briefly threatened Hanoi, with both China and Vietnam suffering heavy losses[^89]. Peace talks broke down in December 1979 and both China (400,000) and Vietnam (600,000) began a major build-up of forces along the border, with sporadic fighting occurring throughout the 1980s[^90]. These conflicts further drained Vietnam's resources and contributed to the economic crisis of the 1980s.

## Personal Life

Le Duan was described by those who knew him personally as having a rigid personality, secretive in manner, with few intimate friends[^91]. He was a strong nationalist who said during the war that the "nation and socialism were one"[^92]. One assessment described him as almost like "a Stalin without the cult of personality, very much a schemer who managed to get himself into a position of power"[^93].

Le Duan was married twice. In 1929, Le Duan married Lê Thị Sương as his first wife, and they had four children together: three daughters (Lê Tuyết Hồng, Lê Thị Cừ, Lê Thị Muội) and one son (Lê Hãn)[^94]. His first wife later died, though the exact date is unclear from historical records. In 1950, Le Duan married Nguyễn Thụy Nga, who was of Chinese background, and they had three children: one daughter (Lê Vũ Anh) and two sons (Lê Kiên Thành, Lê Kiên Trung)[^95].

From his second marriage with Nguyễn Thụy Nga, his eldest son, Li Jiancheng (Lê Kiên Thành), was born in 1955, studied in the former Soviet Union as an aeronautical engineer, later received an associate doctorate in physics, and became the chairman of a bank and chairman of many companies[^96]. The second son, Li Jianzhong (Lê Kiên Trung), was born in 1958, and since 2011 has been the Deputy Chief of the Second General Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security with the rank of Major General[^97]. His children thus achieved prominent positions in post-war Vietnamese society, benefiting from their father's status as one of the most powerful figures in the Vietnamese state.

Some sources suggest there was controversy around the second marriage, with suggestions that he remarried when he became more powerful, though the exact circumstances vary across accounts and remain a matter of some historical debate[^98]. Le Duan maintained his positions of power continuously from 1960 until his death in 1986, an unusually long period of uninterrupted leadership in communist states.

On July 10, 1986, the Communist Party newspaper reported that he had died, after traveling to Moscow several times to receive treatment for liver disease[^99]. He had remained General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam until his death, leading the country for a total of 26 years as party leader[^100]. His death came just months before Vietnam would embark on the Đổi Mới economic reforms that would reverse many of his policies and transform the country's economy.

## Legacy

Lê Duẩn was arguably the second most powerful Vietnamese leader in the 20th century, although he remains less known to the West than Ho Chi Minh or Vo Nguyen Giap[^101]. His legacy is complex and contested, viewed very differently depending on perspective and which aspect of his long rule is examined. He rose in the party hierarchy in the late 1950s and became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam at the 3rd National Congress in 1960, consolidating power after Ho Chi Minh's death in 1969 to become the undisputed leader of North Vietnam, and upon defeating South Vietnam in 1975, he subsequently ruled the newly unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam from 1976 until his death in 1986[^102].

### Military and Strategic Legacy

Le Duan's most significant achievement was leading North Vietnam to victory over the United States and achieving Vietnamese reunification under communist rule. As the mastermind behind the guerilla organization known as the Viet Cong, he was, after Ho Chi Minh, North Vietnam's most significant leader during the war[^103]. The Vietnamese government continues to celebrate him as the "Great Architect of National Reunification," honoring his role in ending foreign intervention and unifying the country[^104].

His strategic vision and unwavering commitment to reunification through armed struggle proved decisive in shaping the course of the war. Analysis reveals Le Duan as a key decision-maker who understood the implications of provoking a much stronger adversary but believed that such actions might ultimately benefit North Vietnam's position, with his approach calculated to undermine American resolve and exploit U.S. overcommitment in Vietnam[^105]. This calculated risk-taking and strategic patience ultimately proved successful, though at enormous cost in lives and resources.

### Political Methods and Governance

However, Le Duan's political methods and governance style remain deeply controversial. The police state he and his comrades built in the North to solidify their power and suppress dissent cast a long shadow over his legacy[^106]. His rigid personality and secretive manner created a leadership style that brooked little dissent and concentrated power in his hands[^107]. He successfully sidelined potential rivals and alternative voices within the party, creating what some have characterized as "a Stalin without the cult of personality"[^108].

Some Western analysts claim that by 1965, Le Duan had split with Ho Chi Minh and that "for all intents and purposes" Le Duan had sidelined Ho, with Le Duan, Le Duc Tho and Pham Hung "progressively trying to neutralise Ho Chi Minh" and Pham Van Dong[^109]. This political maneuvering ensured his dominance but also eliminated checks on his power and alternative policy perspectives that might have moderated some of his more damaging decisions.

### Economic Legacy and Reform

Le Duan's economic legacy is overwhelmingly negative. Though adept at party organizing and mobilizing human resources in pursuit of victory during the Vietnam War, Le Duan proved less pragmatic afterward as a maker of peacetime economic and foreign policy[^110]. His rigid adherence to Soviet-style central planning and forced collectivization led to widespread poverty, starvation, and economic collapse during the subsidy period, ultimately forcing Vietnam to adopt the Đổi Mới reforms in 1986, shortly after his death[^111].

The fact that major economic reforms were implemented almost immediately after his death suggests that his rigid ideological positions had been a primary obstacle to necessary changes. Following his death, the Politburo promptly (though discreetly) denounced Le Duan's administration as managerially incompetent and his southern economic policies as ineffectual[^112]. The dramatic success of the Đổi Mới reforms that reversed his economic policies stands as a damning indictment of his decade of peacetime leadership.

### International Relations

Le Duan's foreign policy legacy is mixed. At the 5th National Congress, Lê Duẩn said that working with the Soviet Union was the "cornerstone" of Vietnam's foreign policy, calling the Soviet Union a "second motherland"[^113]. This alignment provided crucial support during and after the war but also trapped Vietnam in Cold War dynamics and contributed to the break with China. On November 3, 1978, Vietnam and the Soviet Union signed a formal military alliance under his leadership[^114].

His decision to invade Cambodia, while ending the Khmer Rouge genocide, led to international isolation and a devastating war with China that further drained Vietnam's limited resources. The conflicts with Cambodia and China, combined with economic mismanagement, left Vietnam impoverished and isolated by the mid-1980s, dependent on Soviet aid that would disappear with the USSR's collapse just a few years after Le Duan's death.

### Scholarly Assessment

Ironically, few scholars initially considered Le Duan's role, focusing instead on Ho Chi Minh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Pham Van Dong, while Le Duan, who may have been the most influential in the decision-making process in Hanoi, was rarely considered in Western scholarship[^115]. However, more recent scholarship has begun to correct this oversight. Historian Pierre Asselin and scholar Mark Atwood Lawrence have both emphasized Le Duan's central and arguably decisive role in shaping North Vietnam's war strategy and achieving victory[^116].

He continued to lead post-war Vietnam for another decade, drawing it closer to the Soviet Union while presiding over economic stagnation and humanitarian crises[^117]. His death in 1986 marked the end of an era and opened the door for the reforms that would transform Vietnam into one of Southeast Asia's most dynamic economies, though this transformation required abandoning the economic model he had championed. Following the death of Communist Party of Vietnam's General Secretary Le Duan in 1986 and the collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union (1989-90), Vietnam was able to prioritize regional stability and economic reform, suggesting that his rigid ideological positions had been obstacles to progress[^118].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Within Vietnam, official histories continue to honor Le Duan as the "Great Architect of National Reunification" who led the country to victory over foreign intervention and achieved the long-sought goal of a unified, independent Vietnam[^119]. Supporters emphasize his unwavering commitment to national independence and his strategic brilliance in confronting and defeating the world's most powerful military. At the 10th Conference of the Central Committee in 1981, Le Duan himself articulated this view: "We won against the US because our party had a correct and creative revolutionary line, and method. The revolutionary line is to raise the two banners of national independence and socialism. That is the source of all the strength of our revolution. That is also the truth, the power of the times"[^120].

Scholars like Pierre Asselin have written that among the key figures in Hanoi, it was Le Duan who most strongly advocated for war, insisting that armed struggle was the principal means to reunify the country, and his influence on strategic planning during the war against the United States was unparalleled[^121]. Mark Atwood Lawrence noted that Le Duan, more than any other Vietnamese leader, was the true architect of Vietnam's revolutionary victory, highlighting his strategic vision and determination[^122].

From this perspective, Le Duan's greatest achievement was maintaining Vietnamese independence against overwhelming odds, successfully navigating between Chinese and Soviet interests while pursuing Vietnam's national agenda. His supporters argue that the economic difficulties of the post-war period were inevitable given the devastation of decades of war, the American embargo, and hostile encirclement by China. They credit him with maintaining national unity and socialist principles during extremely difficult circumstances, laying the groundwork for Vietnam's eventual emergence as a regional power.

His role in ending the Cambodian genocide through the 1978 invasion is sometimes cited as a humanitarian intervention that saved countless lives, even though it came at significant cost to Vietnam. Defenders of his legacy emphasize that he was willing to act when the international community remained passive in the face of Khmer Rouge atrocities. Vietnamese nationalists appreciate his defiance of both Chinese and American pressure, maintaining that he protected Vietnamese sovereignty and independence at all costs.

### Negative Views

Critics of Le Duan paint a far darker picture, emphasizing his role in creating a repressive police state, his disastrous economic policies, and the humanitarian crises that emerged under his rule. Sympathies among many historians, particularly those with access to testimony from victims, lie with the "North-first" intellectuals and politicians who were victims of Le Duan's repressive police state, and with the people of North Vietnam who suffered continuous bombings and the diversion of precious resources toward the war effort due to his "South-first" strategy[^123].

The story of the political rise of Le Duan and Le Duc Tho includes the police state they and their comrades built in the North to solidify their power and suppress dissent, with Le Duan holding the daily levers of power, including internal security, by means of which he established an effective police state[^124]. His imprisonment of hundreds of thousands in re-education camps, where prisoners were kept on starvation diets, overworked, and harshly punished, represents a massive human rights violation that affected entire families and communities[^125].

Critics point to the boat people crisis, where between 200,000 and 250,000 Vietnamese died at sea trying to escape the conditions his policies created, as damning evidence of his failed governance[^126]. The fact that so many Vietnamese risked death to flee the country he led suggests profound failure to provide for the people's welfare. The economic collapse under his leadership, with 70 percent of the population living below the poverty line during the "subsidy period," inflation reaching 700 percent, and virtually all state enterprises operating at a loss, demonstrates catastrophic economic mismanagement[^127].

Following his death, the Politburo promptly (though discreetly) denounced Le Duan's administration as managerially incompetent and his southern economic policies as ineffectual, suggesting that even his own colleagues recognized his failures once they were free from his control[^128]. The fact that Vietnam's economy only began to recover after implementing Đổi Mới reforms that reversed his core economic policies indicates that his ideological rigidity had been a primary obstacle to development.

One Western assessment described him as almost like "a Stalin without the cult of personality, very much a schemer who managed to get himself into a position of power," suggesting that his political skills exceeded his governance abilities and that he maintained power through manipulation rather than genuine effectiveness[^129]. Critics argue that his foreign policy adventurism, including the invasion of Cambodia and confrontation with China, unnecessarily drained Vietnam's limited resources and prolonged the country's isolation and poverty.

Some analysts contend that Le Duan's aggressive policies toward the South and his provocative stance toward the United States unnecessarily escalated the war and prolonged the suffering of the Vietnamese people. They argue that more moderate leaders might have achieved reunification through negotiation with less bloodshed and destruction, though this remains a matter of considerable debate among historians.
