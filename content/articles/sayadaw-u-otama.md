## Summary

Sayadaw U Ottama (1879-1939) was a Theravada Buddhist monk who became the pioneering leader of Burma's independence movement during British colonial rule. Known as the "Gandhi of Burma," he was the first monk to enter the political arena and the first person in British Burma to be imprisoned for making a political speech. Inspired by Gandhian principles of nonviolent resistance, U Ottama toured the country establishing nationalist organizations, promoting boycotts of British goods, and mobilizing monks and ordinary citizens against colonial oppression. Between 1921 and 1927, he spent more time in prison than outside, and his tireless activism laid the foundation for Burma's eventual independence in 1948.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

U Ottama was born Paw Tun Aung on December 28, 1879, in the village of Rupa near Akyab (modern-day Sittwe) in the Rakhine region of western Burma.[^4] He was the son of U Mra and Daw Aung Kwa Pyu, an impoverished family struggling to make ends meet.[^5] Despite his humble origins, both Ottama and his brother Kyaw Tun Aung (later known as Ariya) managed to attain a basic education at a British-run village school, where young Ottama proved to be a rapid learner.[^6]

Seeking deeper religious education, the young Paw Tun Aung travelled in disguise to the prestigious Pakokku Monastery in the neighboring Magway region and joined their monkhood.[^7] Already demonstrating exceptional intellectual abilities from his time in village school, Ottama excelled at the monastery and earned the patronage of many senior monks as well as financial benefactors who recognized his potential.[^8] These benefactors helped him apply to Calcutta University, opening doors that would shape his future as both a religious leader and political revolutionary.[^9]

At the age of nineteen, he completed his entrance exams and travelled to India where he studied for several years at Calcutta University, focusing on Buddhist studies, Pali, and Sanskrit.[^10] For several years, Ottama was employed as a lecturer on Pali and Buddhist literature at Calcutta University, demonstrating his natural skill for languages and rapidly becoming a polyglot, learning and teaching Sanskrit, English, Japanese, and many other languages.[^11] He later returned to Burma to be fully ordained as a monk, adopting the name Ottama, which means "Supreme" or "Ascendant" in Pali.[^12] He remained active in Pakokku for some time before returning to Arakan to study at the Shwezedi Monastery, where he helped his brother Kyaw Tun Aung join the monkhood.[^13]

## Rise to Power

U Ottama's transformation from scholarly monk to revolutionary leader began during his extensive international travels in the early 20th century. After his studies in Calcutta for three years, he travelled around India and was exposed to the burgeoning Indian independence movement.[^14] In India, he had been close to the Indian National Congress and Mahatma Gandhi, whose philosophy of nonviolent resistance would profoundly influence Ottama's approach to anti-colonial struggle.[^15] He also visited France and Egypt, expanding his worldview and understanding of anti-colonial movements.[^16]

In January 1907, U Ottama went to Japan, where he taught Pali and Sanskrit at the Academy of Buddhist Science in Tokyo.[^17] This appointment made him one of the first Burmese monks to study and teach abroad.[^18] He then travelled extensively to Korea, Manchuria, Port Arthur, China, Annam, Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India, as well as the United States and England.[^19] These travels exposed him to various independence movements and political ideas that he would later bring back to Burma to help lead the anti-colonial struggle against British rule.[^20]

Upon his return to British Burma, U Ottama started his political activities, touring the country and lecturing for the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA), giving anti-colonial speeches that attracted large followings.[^21] He became a member of the YMBA and brought new momentum to the nationalist movement, with a large and powerful section of the Buddhist monks (Pongyis) in Burma coming under his influence.[^22] A fiery speaker and agitator, U Ottama attracted a large following of mainly Buddhist monks who organized demonstrations and meetings, much to the alarm of British colonial authorities who responded fiercely, bringing in the military police to break up these gatherings.[^23]

U Ottama founded Wunthanu Athins (patriotic societies or nationalist associations) at every place he visited.[^24] By 1924, organizations known as Wunthanu Athins were to be found in almost every village in Burma, playing a major role in political mobilization against British colonial rule.[^25] Thousands of these associations operated on the local level, charged with promoting pride in Burmese tradition, national identity, and the Buddhist religion, and with agitating against oppressive measures such as the 1907 Village Act.[^26] U Ottama became involved in emerging political movements, writing articles for the nationalist newspaper Thuriya (The Sun), preaching in villages, and establishing branches of the wunthanu athins.[^27]

## Major Achievements

U Ottama's most significant achievement was pioneering the fusion of Buddhist monasticism with political activism in Burma's independence struggle. Ottama was one of the first monks to enter the political arena and the first person in British Burma to be imprisoned as a result of making a political speech, followed by a long line of nationalists such as Aung San and U Nu.[^28] He is considered by many to be the father of the country's independence movement and is seen as both the first true martyr of Burmese nationalism and father of the modern Arakanese nationalist movement.[^29]

Inspired by Gandhian principles, U Ottama advocated nonviolent resistance, promoting peaceful protests, boycotts of British goods, and a revival of indigenous values and self-reliance.[^30] In a Gandhian way, he transformed a basically political issue—nationalism and independence for Burma—into a religious one which appealed even to those who had not received a British education.[^31] He framed his opposition to colonial rule through Buddhist ethics, creating a compelling message that strongly resonated with the Burmese people.[^32] This unique focus on integrating religious identity into political activism established a profound communal connection to the nationalist struggle.[^33]

His most famous act of defiance came in 1921 when he delivered his infamous "Craddock, Get Out!" speech against the Craddock Scheme proposed by Sir Reginald Craddock, then Governor of British Burma.[^34] This speech led to his arrest and imprisonment for sedition, making him the first person in British Burma to be imprisoned for making a political speech.[^35] At a time when many people in Myanmar were afraid of even the lowest-ranking British officials, U Ottama's fiery words had the power to motivate people and dispel fears in the face of imperialism, and as a result, nationalist associations burgeoned in the country and monks started to preach anti-colonial speeches.[^36]

U Ottama was pivotal in transforming the Burmese nationalist movement by advocating non-violence and boycotts, reminiscent of Gandhi's strategies, and his influence led to the formation of widespread nationalist associations across rural Burma by 1924.[^37] Inspired by Ottama, a large number of Buddhist monks took part in the political movement.[^38] He emphasized non-cooperation and boycotts against British reforms instead of rebellion, advocating a peaceful approach to political change.[^39] He inspired the Burmese by his speeches and his patriotic writings in The Sun newspaper, which supported him and installed him in the press when no monastery would admit him as a political pongyi (monk).[^40]

His extraordinary contributions earned him the title "Sun of Asia," and his patriotic fervor and courage inspired younger generations of Burmese who finally won independence in 1948.[^41] In 1929, he represented the Indian National Congress at the funeral of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, demonstrating his pan-Asian connections and the international recognition of his leadership.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revered status as a nationalist hero, U Ottama's political activism was not without controversy, particularly regarding the role of Buddhist monks in politics. Monastic political agitation "did not sit well with the population at large since this open participation in anti-colonial politics, or in social activism, was deemed to be a violation of the monastic rules."[^43] The majority of the senior monks leading the Burmese Sangha spoke out against monks participating in politics, viewing such activities as being contrary to the Vinaya rules that governed monastic conduct.[^44]

Scholar Michael Mendelson wrote that all politically active monks tended to be labeled by the colonial authorities as "political agitators in the yellow robes," a characterization that sought to delegitimize their religious authority.[^45] The British colonial government viewed U Ottama as a dangerous radical and repeatedly imprisoned him on charges of sedition.[^46] Between 1921 and 1927, according to academics, U Ottama spent more time in prison than outside, enduring harsh conditions that would eventually take a toll on his health.[^47]

There were also contradictions in U Ottama's philosophical approach. While U Ottama was faithful to his Gandhian ideals and did not personally advocate the use of violence in the anti-colonial struggle, he argued that British rule was an obstacle to the practice of Buddhism and thus independence had to be gained, through violent means if necessary.[^48] In support of the use of force under certain circumstances, he quoted some Jatakas (Buddhist birth stories), creating tension between his professed nonviolence and the realities of anti-colonial resistance.[^49] Despite his personal advocacy of nonviolence, during the 1920s there were several violent incidents involving militant monks agitating against colonial rule, some of whom claimed inspiration from U Ottama's teachings.[^50]

In his latter years, U Ottama endured illness, poverty, and neglect at the hands of a younger generation of Burmese nationalists who had moved beyond his methods.[^51] Some historians have noted that while U Ottama certainly influenced Saya San during the early 1920s, the differences between these two leaders were more significant than their similarities.[^52] U Ottama was described as a "cosmopolitan revolutionary," while Saya San's efforts were "less modern but more successful" in mobilizing rural peasants through traditional and religious appeals rather than modern nationalist programs.[^53]

---

## Personal Life

U Ottama maintained the austere life of a Buddhist monk throughout his career, adhering to monastic vows of celibacy and simplicity even as he became a prominent political figure. Born into an impoverished Rakhine family, he never forgot his humble origins and remained committed to serving the common people of Burma.[^54]

His natural skill for languages allowed him to rapidly become a polyglot, learning and teaching Sanskrit, English, Japanese, and many other languages.[^55] This linguistic ability served him well both as a teacher and as a political organizer who could communicate with diverse audiences across Asia. His brother Kyaw Tun Aung, who took the monastic name Ariya, joined him in the monkhood at Shwezedi Monastery, though historical records provide little detail about their relationship or Ariya's activities.[^56]

U Ottama was known for his fiery oratory and charismatic presence. As a fiery speaker and agitator, he attracted large followings of mainly Buddhist monks who organized demonstrations and meetings in his support.[^57] His speeches had a profound emotional impact on his audiences, dispelling fears and motivating people to action at a time when British colonial power seemed insurmountable.[^58]

During his repeated imprisonments between 1921 and 1927, U Ottama endured significant hardship. The British colonial authorities ignored his nonviolent approach and treated him harshly, contributing to the deterioration of his health.[^59] In his final years, he suffered from diabetes and other ailments related to his years of imprisonment and the physical toll of constant travel and activism.[^60] The newspaper The Sun supported him and provided him a platform when no monastery would admit him as a political pongyi, showing the controversial nature of his activism even within Buddhist circles.[^61]

## Legacy

U Ottama died in Rangoon Hospital on September 9, 1939, at the age of 60, suffering from diabetes after years of imprisonment and declining health.[^62] His death marked the end of an era in Burma's independence movement, but his influence would continue to shape the nation for decades to come.

U Ottama's activities led to the emergence of a militant, anti-colonial movement that propagated a combination of nationalism, Buddhism and, in its later stages, socialism.[^63] This mix of political and religious beliefs was adhered to in varying degrees by most nationalist politicians in colonial Burma—and little changed in this regard after the country's independence in 1948.[^64] His work laid the foundation for subsequent nationalist leaders like Aung San and U Nu in Burma's eventual path to independence in 1948.[^65]

His death on September 9, 1939, is commemorated annually as "U Ottama Day" to honor his memory and to remind contemporary generations of the long struggle against colonial oppression.[^66] His anniversary is widely observed across Rakhine State including Kyaukphyu, Taungup and other townships, and commemorations occur in Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, and other countries with Burmese diaspora communities.[^67] His old monastery in Sittwe in what is now Arakan State, the Shwezedi, continues to be an important focal point for political and anti-government activities.[^68]

U Ottama is considered one of the national heroes of modern Myanmar, and his contributions to the independence struggle are recognized in official histories and public memory.[^69] He is honored as both a religious figure and a political revolutionary who demonstrated that monks could play an active role in fighting injustice while maintaining their spiritual commitments.[^70] His example inspired generations of politically active monks in Myanmar, though the question of whether monks should engage in politics remains controversial to this day.[^71]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians widely regard U Ottama as a transformative figure who successfully merged Buddhist religious identity with political nationalism, pioneering methods that would shape Burma's independence movement for decades.[^72] He was pivotal in transforming the Burmese nationalist movement by advocating non-violence and boycotts, reminiscent of Gandhi's strategies, and his influence led to the formation of widespread nationalist associations across rural Burma by 1924.[^73]

The scholarly consensus portrays U Ottama as a foundational figure whose unique focus on integrating religious identity into political activism established a profound communal connection to the nationalist struggle.[^74] Growing up in a politically conscious environment and studying in India shaped U Ottama's non-violent resistance approach, reminiscent of Gandhian principles, and he was deeply affected by encounters with Indian nationalist movements and Buddhist teachings.[^75]

Human Rights Watch and other international organizations have recognized U Ottama as a pioneering figure in the tradition of Buddhist activism in Burma, noting that he was the first of many monks who stood up against British colonial rule.[^76] His courage in being the first person in British Burma to be imprisoned for making a political speech set a powerful precedent for civil disobedience and inspired countless others to overcome their fear of colonial authorities.[^77]

Academic researchers have praised U Ottama's ability to galvanize support mainly among politically active monks and rural populations, creating a broad-based movement that transcended educational and class boundaries.[^78] In a Gandhian way, he transformed a basically political issue—nationalism and independence for Burma—into a religious one which appealed even to those who had not received a British education, making the independence movement accessible to all Burmese people.[^79]

### Negative Views

Critics have pointed out the inherent contradictions in U Ottama's approach, particularly the tension between his professed commitment to nonviolence and his statements that independence should be gained "through violent means if necessary."[^80] This philosophical inconsistency, they argue, undermined the coherence of his message and contributed to violence in the nationalist movement.

Traditional Buddhist authorities criticized U Ottama and other politically active monks for violating the Vinaya rules that prohibited monks from engaging in worldly politics.[^81] The majority of senior monks leading the Burmese Sangha spoke out against such participation, viewing it as a corruption of the monastic path and a distraction from spiritual practice.[^82] Monastic political agitation "did not sit well with the population at large since this open participation in anti-colonial politics, or in social activism, was deemed to be a violation of the monastic rules."[^83]

Some historians have argued that U Ottama's cosmopolitan, modernist approach was less effective in mobilizing rural Burmese than more traditional methods.[^84] Scholar Robert Solomon noted that U Ottama was a "cosmopolitan revolutionary," while Saya San's efforts were "less modern but more successful" because the rural Burmese of 1930 were more responsive to symbolic appeals than to programmatic designs for reform.[^85] This suggests that U Ottama's international education and exposure to Western political ideas may have actually limited his effectiveness among ordinary Burmese villagers.

Critics also point out that in his latter years, U Ottama endured "poverty, and neglect at the hands of a younger generation of Burmese nationalists," suggesting that his methods and leadership had been superseded by the time of his death.[^86] The emergence of more secular nationalist leaders like Aung San represented a shift away from U Ottama's religiously-centered approach to independence, though these later leaders built on the foundation he had established.[^87]

Colonial authorities and their defenders dismissed U Ottama as merely a "political agitator in the yellow robes," denying the sincerity of his religious convictions and portraying him as an opportunist who exploited his monastic status for political ends.[^88] This characterization, however, is generally rejected by postcolonial historians as an attempt to delegitimize genuine anti-colonial resistance.
