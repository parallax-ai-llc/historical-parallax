## Summary

Count Soejima Taneomi (副島種臣, October 17, 1828 – January 31, 1905) was a prominent Japanese diplomat, politician, and statesman who played a critical role in shaping early Meiji Japan's foreign policy.[^1] Born into a samurai family in Saga domain, he served as Foreign Minister from 1871 to 1873 during some of the most pivotal diplomatic crises of the era, including the María Luz incident and negotiations with China over Taiwan.[^2] After resigning over the failed Seikanron debate to invade Korea, he returned to government service and eventually became a count, Privy Council vice-chairman, and Home Minister.[^3] Beyond politics, Soejima was also a distinguished calligrapher and spiritual disciple of Honda Chikaatsu, leaving a complex legacy as both a skilled diplomat and controversial expansionist.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Soejima Taneomi was born on October 17, 1828, into a samurai family in Saga, Hizen Province (present-day Saga Prefecture), during the late Edo period.[^5] He was the second son of Nango Edayoshi (also known as Taneaki Edayoshi), a respected scholar of National Learning (kokugaku) who taught at Kodokan, the official school of the Saga domain.[^6] His older brother, Shinyo Edayoshi, was also a scholar of Japanese literature, creating an intellectually rich family environment that deeply influenced young Taneomi's development.[^7] This background in traditional Japanese learning would later complement his Western education, making him uniquely positioned to navigate the complex diplomatic landscape of Meiji Japan.

At the age of 32, Taneomi became the adopted son of Toshitada Soejima, also of the Saga domain, and took the Soejima family name.[^8] This adoption was a common practice among samurai families to ensure continuity of lineage and social position. Through his father and brother's influence, he became aware of the sonno joi ("revere the emperor, expel the barbarians") doctrine early in his life, which shaped his political consciousness during the turbulent final years of the Tokugawa shogunate.[^9]

Soejima attended the Chienkan domain school, where he formed lifelong associations with fellow Saga domain intellectuals including Shinpei Eto and Takato Oki, both of whom would later become prominent figures in the Meiji government.[^10] This network of Saga domain allies would prove crucial throughout his political career. In 1866, recognizing the need to understand Western knowledge, the domain leaders sent Soejima to Nagasaki to study the English language.[^11] There, he studied under Guido Verbeck, a Dutch Reformed missionary who taught numerous future Meiji leaders, including political science, international law, the United States Constitution, and the New Testament.[^12] This exposure to Western political philosophy and legal systems gave Soejima a sophisticated understanding of international relations that few Japanese officials possessed at the time.

Although born into a samurai family and well-educated in Western studies, Soejima maintained a broad knowledge of Chinese literature and culture.[^13] He went by the common name of Jiro and adopted the pen-names Sokai (滄海) and Ichiichi Gakujin, under which he would later become known for his calligraphy and spiritual writings.[^14] This fusion of traditional East Asian learning with modern Western knowledge became the hallmark of his intellectual approach and diplomatic style.

## Rise to Power

Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Soejima Taneomi quickly emerged as a key figure in the new government. During the Boshin War that preceded the establishment of the Meiji government, he served as a military leader of the Saga forces committed to the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate.[^15] The Saga domain played an important role when the new government was formed, and Soejima, along with his associate Shinpei Eto, was dispatched to Kyoto to participate in establishing the new political order.[^16]

Soejima's first significant contribution to the Meiji state came in 1868 when he became a junior councilor (san'yo) and assisted Fukuoka Takachika in drafting the Seitaisho ("Document on Form of Government"), one of the central governing documents of the new Meiji government.[^17] This foundational work demonstrated his understanding of constitutional principles learned from Guido Verbeck and helped establish the administrative structure of early Meiji Japan. His role in crafting this document placed him among the core group of Meiji oligarchs who would shape Japan's modernization.

In 1871, Soejima assumed the crucial office of gaimukyo (Foreign Minister), a position that would define his career and place him at the center of Japan's most pressing diplomatic challenges.[^18] Members of the Meiji government had enlisted support from leaders of fiefs with which they had worked, including Okuma Shigenobu and Soejima Taneomi of Saga, demonstrating his importance as a representative of the Saga domain in the new government structure.[^19] His appointment came at a critical juncture when Japan was navigating complex relationships with Western powers while attempting to assert sovereignty in East Asia.

Soejima's rise was particularly remarkable because, while most of Japan's senior leadership embarked on the Iwakura Mission (1871-1873)—an around-the-world diplomatic tour to the United States and Europe—he remained in Tokyo as part of the caretaker government.[^20] During this period, he served as interim Foreign Minister with considerable autonomy, dealing with some of the most sensitive international incidents of the early Meiji period.[^21] The government left behind was embodied by Sanjo Sanetomi, Saigo Takamori, Okuma Shigenobu, Itagaki Taisuke, Goto Shojiro, Soejima Taneomi, Inoue Kaoru, and Oki Takato.[^22] This responsibility demonstrated the trust placed in Soejima by the Meiji leadership and gave him unprecedented opportunity to implement his vision of Japanese foreign policy.

## Major Achievements

### The María Luz Incident (1872)

One of Soejima Taneomi's most celebrated diplomatic achievements occurred in July 1872 with the María Luz incident, which became a landmark case in international law and Japanese sovereignty.[^23] On July 9, 1872, the María Luz, a Peruvian cargo ship traveling from Macao to Callao, Peru, carrying Chinese indentured laborers destined for Peruvian plantations, stopped at the treaty port of Yokohama to repair storm damage.[^24] While anchored, one Chinese coolie escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to the nearby British warship HMS Iron Duke, seeking protection from the brutal conditions aboard the vessel.[^25]

British officials formally approached Foreign Minister Soejima to take action, presenting him with a difficult diplomatic challenge.[^26] The case involved complex questions of extraterritoriality and the unequal treaties that limited Japanese legal jurisdiction over foreign vessels.[^27] However, Soejima, familiar with international law from his studies with Guido Verbeck, saw an opportunity to assert Japanese sovereignty. After receiving authorization from Sanjo Sanetomi, Soejima took steps to prevent the María Luz from leaving port, conducting an investigation that revealed the ship's cargo of illiterate indentured laborers had been deceived in Macao into signing contracts and were being confined against their will under inhumane conditions.[^28]

Despite foreign opposition and charges of lack of jurisdiction, Soejima upheld the court's decision, and the Chinese laborers were freed of their contracts on August 30, 1872.[^29] Peru brought the matter to international arbitration, but in June 1875, an International Court presided over by Russian Czar Alexander II ruled that "the measures taken by Japan were appropriate conforming to all international laws and treaties."[^30] Soejima was praised by the Chinese government over his handling of the affair, which represented a rare diplomatic victory against Western powers and accelerated the decline of the "coolie trade" in Peru and elsewhere.[^31] This incident demonstrated Japan's emergence as a civilized nation capable of enforcing humanitarian principles and international law, bolstering arguments for treaty revision.

### Negotiations with Russia on Sakhalin

Soejima also made significant contributions to resolving the complex territorial dispute between Japan and Russia over Sakhalin Island. In 1871, he was sent to Siberia to adjust boundary questions relating to Sakhalin, which at the time was under joint occupation by both countries.[^32] In 1872, Soejima proposed to Russian charge d'affaires Evgeny Butzov in Tokyo a plan to purchase the island of Sakhalin, modeling the proposal on the American purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[^33]

When the Russian side proved unwilling to sell, Soejima proposed dividing Sakhalin, wanting to retain southern Sakhalin for geopolitical reasons—specifically to maintain Japanese control of the La Pérouse Strait between Hokkaido and Sakhalin.[^34] His diplomatic strategy was complex and forward-thinking: after returning from China in 1873, he proposed to Butzov that Japan would cede Sakhalin to Russia if Russia would maintain neutrality and allow the Japanese army to transit Russian territory when Japan attacked Korea, showing that Soejima's plan to abandon Sakhalin was a strategic compromise for the expedition to Korea and Taiwan.[^35]

Though Soejima left government before the negotiations concluded, he succeeded in advancing the stagnated territorial problem to a new stage by making the abandonment of Sakhalin a predetermined route, and built a relationship of trust between Japan and Russia that was a prerequisite for solving the territorial problem.[^36] The eventual Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1875, negotiated by Enomoto Takeaki, saw Japan renounce claims to Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of all the Kuril Islands, fulfilling the diplomatic groundwork Soejima had laid.[^37]

### The Beijing Mission and Taiwan Crisis (1873)

Soejima's most ambitious and controversial diplomatic mission came in 1873 when he led an embassy to Beijing to address the murder of 54 Ryukyuan sailors by Paiwan aborigines on the southwestern tip of Taiwan in December 1871.[^38] The Japanese foreign minister went to Beijing in June 1873, seeking both compensation and formal recognition of Japan's sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, which had only been formally claimed as Japanese territory in September 1872 under Soejima's authority.[^39]

On June 29, 1873, Soejima achieved a remarkable diplomatic triumph: he was granted an audience with the 17-year-old Tongzhi Emperor at the "Pavilion of Purple Light," one of the lakeside palaces west of the Forbidden City (now part of Zhongnanhai).[^40] This was historically significant because it was one of the first audiences the Tongzhi Emperor granted to foreign representatives after assuming personal control of government, and for the first time in Chinese history, the emperor did not demand the ceremonial kowtow—kneeling and touching the forehead to the ground.[^41] The Japanese Ambassador was received first because of his higher rank, marking a symbolic elevation of Japan's diplomatic status.[^42]

However, Soejima's request for compensation was rejected because China considered the Taiwan incident an internal affair, as Taiwan was part of Fujian Province and the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China.[^43] When Soejima claimed that four victims were from Oda Prefecture (present-day Okayama Prefecture), Chinese officials refused compensation on grounds that most Taiwanese aboriginals were outside effective Chinese control and thus sometimes exempt from judicial action.[^44] Japan interpreted this response as implicit acknowledgment that the Qing government had not opposed Japan's claims to sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, had disclaimed jurisdiction over indigenous Taiwanese peoples, and had indeed consented to Japan's expedition to Taiwan.[^45]

Soejima's diplomatic strategy involved avoiding controversy by developing the "terra nullius in Taiwanese Aboriginal Area" argument—suggesting that if China claimed no responsibility for the aborigines, surely they wouldn't mind Japan dispatching a punitive mission.[^46] This mission succeeded in establishing formal diplomatic relations between Japan and China, though it also laid the groundwork for the controversial Taiwan Expedition of 1874.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Seikanron Debate and Resignation

Soejima Taneomi's career reached a turning point with the Seikanron ("Debate on Invasion of Korea"), a major political crisis in 1873 that resulted in a significant split among the early Meiji leadership.[^48] As a proponent of aggressive expansionism, Soejima stood alongside Saigo Takamori, Eto Shinpei, and Itagaki Taisuke in advocating for a punitive expedition against Korea, viewing such action as essential for asserting Japan's sovereignty amid fears of Western encroachment in East Asia.[^49]

Opponents, including Iwakura Tomomi and Okubo Toshimichi, who had just returned from the Iwakura Mission after observing Western power firsthand, countered that Japan lacked the military and economic readiness for such a venture.[^50] They emphasized the need to prioritize internal reforms and treaty revisions with Western powers rather than foreign military adventures.[^51] The debate came to a head in October 1873, when the anti-intervention faction prevailed. Saigo Takamori submitted his resignation on October 23, 1873, followed the next day by resignations from Itagaki, Goto, Eto, and Soejima.[^52] All five councilors stepped down from their public posts on October 25, 1873.[^53]

Soejima's support for the Korean invasion revealed his hawkish tendencies and willingness to risk military conflict for what he perceived as Japan's national interests. Critics viewed this stance as reckless and premature, potentially endangering Japan's modernization efforts and inviting retaliation from foreign powers. His resignation marked the end of his first period in government and contributed to a political crisis that would have lasting consequences, including the Saga Rebellion of 1874 led by his former associate Eto Shinpei.[^54]

### The Taiwan Expedition Controversy

While Soejima had resigned before the 1874 Taiwan Expedition was launched, his diplomatic mission to Beijing in 1873 laid the foundation for this controversial military action.[^55] The ambiguous Chinese response that Soejima had elicited—claiming aboriginals were outside effective Chinese control—was interpreted by Japan as tacit consent for military intervention, though the Qing Dynasty clearly had not intended such an interpretation.[^56]

On April 26, 1874, Lieutenant General Saigo Tsugumichi, commander of the Japanese invasion force to Taiwan, was ordered by the Meiji government to withhold the expedition at the last moment, but he defied his political leaders and invaded the island anyway.[^57] This act of military disobedience established dangerous precedents for military autonomy that would have significant implications for Japan's future, ultimately contributing to the pattern of gekokujo (inferiors overruling superiors) that plagued Japanese civil-military relations in the early 20th century.[^58]

Scholarly assessment of Soejima's role remains divided. The Japan-China Joint History Research Report notes the disputed nature of sovereignty claims over the Ryukyu Islands during this period, observing that neither Soejima nor Okubo Toshimichi had succeeded in securing any Chinese endorsement of Japan's sovereign right over Ryukyu, nor did the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1874 concerning the settlement of the Taiwan crisis legally settle the Ryukyu problem, since Ryukyu was never mentioned in the Treaty.[^59] Critics argue that Soejima's diplomatic maneuvering deliberately created ambiguity to justify future military action, while supporters contend he skillfully navigated complex international law to advance Japanese interests.

### Questionable Strategic Compromises

Soejima's willingness to cede Sakhalin to Russia in exchange for Russian neutrality during a potential Korean invasion reveals a troubling pattern of viewing territorial concessions as bargaining chips for military adventures.[^60] While some historians praise this as strategic pragmatism, others view it as reckless abandonment of Japanese territorial claims for the sake of aggressive expansion elsewhere. The fact that Japan ultimately gave up Sakhalin without gaining the Korean expedition he desired raises questions about the wisdom of his diplomatic strategy.

## Personal Life

Soejima Taneomi's personal life reflected the complex intersection of traditional Japanese culture, Western learning, and spiritual exploration that characterized many Meiji intellectuals. He married and had descendants; critic and specially appointed professor of Tokoha Gakuen University, Takahiko Soejima, is a direct descendant of Taneomi Soejima.[^61] Details about his immediate family, including his wife and children, remain sparse in historical records, as was common for political figures of the era whose public roles overshadowed their private lives.

Beyond politics, Soejima was renowned as a master calligrapher who left behind many great works.[^62] His calligraphy was "telling of his upbringing, being uninhibited yet magnificent, and highly dignified."[^63] Representative works include 'Kiunhiu,' 'Momiji-kan' (stored at the Saga Prefectural Art Museum), 'Shinhi Shujin Jinjitsu Shujin,' and 'Kasugaki Shiku.'[^64] His calligraphic works are held in prestigious collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which houses examples of his two-line calligraphy and cursive script works.[^65] The dynamism of his calligraphic forms reflected his character as a career politician who served at different times as foreign minister, councilor of state, advisor in the Imperial Household Ministry, and home minister during the Meiji period.[^66]

Exhibitions commemorating the one-hundredth anniversary of Soejima's death, titled "Sokai - Taneomi Soejima 'Calligraphy of the Soul,'" were held at the Saga Prefectural Art Museum in 2006 and at the Gotoh Museum in 2007, testifying to his enduring artistic legacy.[^67] He was good at Chinese poetry and calligraphy, maintaining intimate relations with the renowned calligrapher Gochiku Nakabayashi.[^68]

Perhaps most intriguing was Soejima's deep involvement with spiritualism and Shinto philosophy. Starting from around 1873, following his resignation from government, Soejima became one of the best disciples of Honda Chikaatsu, a spiritualist known for devising chinkon kishin—meditation and spirit possession techniques combining chinkon ("calming the soul") and kishin ("returning to the divine").[^69] He had been introduced to Honda by Saigo Takamori in the early 1870s, forming a spiritual relationship that would last the rest of his life.[^70]

In the 1883 text Shinto montai (真道問対), Soejima posed a series of 114 questions about the nature of the universe, soul, and divine matters in a Socratic-style dialogue with his master Honda, written in literary Chinese.[^71] A notable exchange demonstrates his philosophical inquiries: When Soejima asked, "What kind of clothing, food, and dwelling does God (kami) have?" Honda answered, "God wears the Way, eats the Way, and dwells in the Way."[^72] A similar text, "Questions and answers at Sokai's window" (滄海窓問答, Sokaisō mondō), was compiled in 1898 by Sasaki Tetsutaro, containing 98 questions and answers on Soejima's understanding of Honda's spiritual studies, with the title derived from Soejima's nickname Sokai.[^73] His spiritual pursuits reveal a man seeking deeper meaning beyond politics, exploring the metaphysical foundations of existence through traditional Japanese religious practices.

## Legacy

Soejima Taneomi's legacy in Japanese history remains complex and multifaceted, encompassing both significant diplomatic achievements and controversial expansionist policies that presaged Japan's later imperial trajectory. After his resignation in 1873, he did not permanently withdraw from public life but instead participated in the nascent democratic movement before eventually returning to government service.

### Political Reform Advocacy

Immediately after being defeated in the Seikanron debate in October 1873, Soejima joined with Itagaki Taisuke, Goto Shojiro, Eto Shinpei, and others to publish the Minsen Giin Setsuritsu Kenpakusho (Petition for Establishing an Elected Assembly) on January 17, 1874.[^74] This petition was the first formal request to the Meiji government to establish a parliament with democratically-elected representatives and triggered the Jiyu Minken Undo (Movement for Liberty and People's Rights).[^75] The petition criticized the concentration of political power in the hands of neither the Emperor nor the people, but in "Yushi Sensei" (despotism by domain-dominated government).[^76] It advocated abolishing autocracy by bureaucrats and establishing a popularly-elected chamber to debate state affairs.[^77] The petition was carried in newspapers, triggering national debates about when a parliament should be established and greatly influencing the freedom and people's rights movement.[^78] This involvement demonstrates that despite his authoritarian tendencies in foreign policy, Soejima supported constitutional government and popular participation domestically.

### Return to Government Service

Soejima's skills and connections proved too valuable to remain unused. In 1878, he returned to government service, becoming a first-class imperial tutor at the Imperial Household Department.[^79] His career continued to advance through the 1880s and 1890s in increasingly prestigious positions: in 1887, he served as an advisor to the Imperial Court; in 1888, he served as an advisor for state secrets and was appointed to the Privy Council; in 1891, he became vice-chairman of the Privy Council; and in 1892, he served as Home Minister in the first Matsukata Cabinet.[^80] In 1884, he was elevated to the peerage with the rank of hakushaku (count), and he was also a recipient of the First Order of Merit.[^81] These appointments demonstrate that his earlier resignation over the Korean question had not permanently damaged his standing among the Meiji elite.

### Diplomatic Foundations

Soejima's diplomatic achievements established important precedents for Japanese foreign policy. His handling of the María Luz incident showed that Japan could successfully assert sovereignty and humanitarian principles against Western powers, providing a model for future treaty revision negotiations.[^82] His establishment of formal diplomatic relations with China, despite the tensions over Taiwan and Ryukyu, created channels for ongoing engagement that would shape Sino-Japanese relations for decades.[^83] His groundwork on the Sakhalin question, though he did not complete the negotiations himself, contributed to the eventual Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1875, which clarified Japan's northern borders.[^84]

### Scholarly Reassessment

Modern scholarly assessment of Soejima remains limited, particularly in English-language sources, with most academic attention focused on his role in specific diplomatic incidents rather than comprehensive historical evaluation.[^85] Three volumes of "The Complete Works of Taneomi Soejima" (edited by Yoshitaka Shima, Keibunsha) were published in recent years, and a biography by Kanji Maruyama (the father of famous political theorist Masao Maruyama) called "Count Taneomi Soejima" was reissued at Misuzu Shobo publishing company, indicating renewed scholarly interest in his life and work.[^86] These works provide valuable primary sources for reassessing his contributions to Meiji statecraft.

Soejima's legacy ultimately embodies the contradictions of early Meiji Japan: a modernizer who retained traditional cultural values, a diplomat who understood international law yet advocated aggressive expansion, a proponent of domestic constitutional government who supported authoritarian foreign policy. His life illustrates the complex process by which Japan transformed from an isolated feudal society to a modern imperial power, with all the achievements and moral compromises that transformation entailed.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Soejima Taneomi emphasize his crucial role in establishing Japan's credibility as a civilized nation capable of participating in the international legal order. His handling of the María Luz incident is particularly celebrated as a landmark case where Japan successfully asserted humanitarian principles and legal jurisdiction despite the constraints of the unequal treaties.[^87] The fact that the international arbitration ruled in Japan's favor validated Soejima's legal reasoning and demonstrated his sophisticated understanding of international law, which he had acquired through study with Guido Verbeck.[^88] This victory had implications far beyond the case itself, strengthening Japan's arguments for treaty revision and equal status with Western powers.

Scholars who study early Meiji diplomacy recognize Soejima's skill in navigating the complex diplomatic landscape of the 1870s, when Japan faced pressure from both Western imperial powers and its Asian neighbors.[^89] His mission to Beijing and the audience with the Tongzhi Emperor represented a significant diplomatic achievement, elevating Japan's status in East Asian interstate relations and establishing formal diplomatic channels with China.[^90] The symbolic importance of being received by the emperor without performing the kowtow cannot be overstated, as it marked Japan's emergence from the traditional Sinocentric tribute system to a relationship of theoretical equals.

Soejima's contributions to resolving the Sakhalin territorial dispute also receive praise for advancing stagnant negotiations and building a relationship of trust between Japan and Russia that proved essential for the eventual Treaty of Saint Petersburg.[^91] His pragmatic approach to territorial questions—viewing them as potentially negotiable rather than sacred and inviolable—demonstrated strategic flexibility that some historians view as evidence of sophisticated statecraft.

Supporters also point to his role in helping draft the Seitaisho in 1868 and his later participation in the democratic reform movement through the Minsen Giin Setsuritsu Kenpakusho petition as evidence of his commitment to constitutional government and political modernization.[^92] His diverse career spanning diplomacy, domestic administration, spiritual studies, and the arts reflects the breadth of learning and cultural sophistication that characterized the best of the Meiji oligarchs.

### Negative Views

Critics of Soejima Taneomi focus on his role in promoting aggressive expansionism that ultimately contributed to Japanese imperialism and military adventurism. His advocacy during the Seikanron debate for military action against Korea is seen as reckless and premature, potentially endangering Japan's still-fragile modernization process for the sake of national prestige and territorial expansion.[^93] The fact that he resigned rather than accept the decision of his colleagues suggests an unwillingness to compromise on matters of foreign policy that some historians view as evidence of dangerous inflexibility.

The ambiguous diplomatic language Soejima employed during his Beijing mission regarding Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan's aboriginal territories has been criticized as deliberately designed to create legal pretexts for military intervention.[^94] While supporters view this as skilled diplomacy, critics argue it represented manipulative statecraft that prioritized expansion over peaceful relations. The subsequent Taiwan Expedition of 1874, though launched after his resignation, drew on the diplomatic groundwork he had laid, and the military's defiance of civilian authority during that expedition established troubling precedents for civil-military relations that would plague Japan into the 20th century.[^95]

Soejima's willingness to trade away Sakhalin to Russia in exchange for Russian neutrality during a potential Korean invasion reveals strategic priorities that some historians find questionable.[^96] Rather than defending every inch of Japanese territory, he viewed territorial questions as bargaining chips for military adventures elsewhere, a calculus that ultimately failed when the Korean invasion was rejected but the pressure to cede Sakhalin remained. This raises questions about whether his diplomatic strategy served Japan's long-term interests.

Furthermore, the Japan-China Joint History Research Report notes that neither Soejima nor Okubo succeeded in securing Chinese endorsement of Japan's sovereign rights over Ryukyu, and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1874 did not legally settle the Ryukyu problem.[^97] This suggests that despite the symbolic achievement of the imperial audience, Soejima's Beijing mission failed to accomplish its primary diplomatic objectives, leaving territorial ambiguities that would contribute to future Sino-Japanese tensions.

Critics also note the limited scholarly attention Soejima has received in comprehensive historical assessments, suggesting that his contributions may have been less significant than those of contemporaries like Okubo Toshimichi, Ito Hirobumi, and Iwakura Tomomi, who feature more prominently in histories of the Meiji period.[^98] His legacy remains primarily tied to specific incidents rather than transformative policies or institutions, indicating a career of tactical achievements rather than strategic vision.
