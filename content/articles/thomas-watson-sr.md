## Summary

Thomas John Watson Sr. (1874-1956) was an American business magnate who transformed International Business Machines (IBM) from a small tabulating machine company into a global industrial powerhouse. As CEO from 1914 to 1956, Watson pioneered modern corporate culture with his famous "THINK" motto and paternalistic management style, growing IBM's revenues from under $5 million to nearly $900 million.[^1] While celebrated as one of the greatest business leaders of the 20th century, his legacy is complicated by IBM's controversial business dealings with Nazi Germany during the 1930s and early 1940s, which facilitated the Holocaust through Hollerith punch-card technology.[^2] Watson's impact on corporate America, sales culture, and the computing industry remains profound, establishing management principles that influenced generations of business leaders worldwide.

## Early Life and Background

Thomas John Watson was born on February 17, 1874, in Campbell, New York, a small town in the state's Southern Tier region.[^3] He was the fifth child and only son of Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson, a family descended from Scots who immigrated to the United States from Ireland during the devastating potato famine of the mid-nineteenth century.[^4] His father operated a modest lumber business near Painted Post, a few miles west of Corning, and also farmed the land, exposing young Thomas to the realities of business and hard work from an early age.[^5]

Watson's childhood was spent working on the family farm in East Campbell and attending District School Number Five in the late 1870s.[^6] As he entered his teenage years, Watson attended Addison Academy in nearby Addison, receiving a basic secondary education typical of rural America during that era.[^7] His father harbored ambitions for Thomas to study law after finishing school, envisioning a professional career that would elevate the family's social standing.[^8] However, young Watson had different ideas about his future path.

Initially deciding to become a teacher instead of pursuing law, Watson's career in education was remarkably brief—he changed his mind after spending just a single day in the classroom, realizing that teaching was not his calling.[^9] Determined to enter the business world, Watson enrolled in a year-long course in accounting and business at the Miller School of Commerce in Elmira, New York.[^10] This practical education, focused on commercial skills rather than classical liberal arts, would prove far more valuable for his future career than any law degree might have been.

In 1891, at age seventeen, Watson left the Miller School and took his first real job as a bookkeeper for Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, earning a modest wage of six dollars per week.[^11] The work was steady but uninspiring, and Watson soon found himself drawn to a more dynamic opportunity. He joined George Cornwell, a traveling salesman, peddling organs and pianos around the farms of upstate New York for William Bronson's local hardware store.[^12] This early experience as a traveling salesman proved foundational, teaching Watson the art of persuasion, the importance of personal relationships in business, and the thrill of making sales—lessons that would define his entire career and shape his revolutionary approach to corporate management.

## Rise to Power

Watson's transformation from a small-town traveling salesman to one of America's most powerful industrialists began with a failed entrepreneurial venture. After his early sales experiences, Watson attempted to establish his own business—a butcher shop in Buffalo, New York—but the venture ended in failure, leaving him financially troubled and professionally adrift.[^13] This setback, however, led to the opportunity that would change his life forever.

In November 1896, at age twenty-two, Watson joined the sales staff of the National Cash Register Company (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio, as a sales apprentice.[^14] NCR, under the autocratic leadership of its president John Henry Patterson, was pioneering new approaches to sales and marketing that would revolutionize American business. Watson proved to be an exceptional student of Patterson's methods, which emphasized professional appearance, systematic training, motivational meetings, and aggressive sales tactics.[^15] Watson's talents were quickly recognized, and he rose through the ranks with remarkable speed.

By 1907, Watson had been transferred to NCR headquarters in Dayton, a sign of his growing importance to the organization.[^16] Three years later, at age thirty-six, he was promoted to sales manager, one of the most powerful positions in the company.[^17] Watson absorbed everything Patterson taught him about creating a motivated sales force, building corporate culture, and establishing company loyalty. The famous "THINK" slogan that would later become synonymous with IBM actually originated during Watson's time at NCR—he first used it in December 1911 while managing the sales and advertising departments, interrupting an uninspiring sales meeting by declaring, "The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough."[^18]

However, Watson's career at NCR ended in crisis. Patterson had developed what many considered monopolistic practices, and in 1912, Watson and several other NCR executives were indicted and convicted in a federal antitrust case for illegal business practices designed to suppress competition.[^19] Watson was sentenced to jail, though he never served the sentence as the conviction was later overturned on appeal.[^20] Nevertheless, Patterson fired Watson in 1913, ending his eighteen-year career at NCR under a cloud of legal scandal.[^21]

This apparent disaster became Watson's greatest opportunity. In 1914, the financier Charles Flint recruited the unemployed but highly experienced Watson to head the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a struggling amalgamation of three loosely connected businesses that manufactured electric punched-card machines, industrial scales, and time clocks.[^22] The company was small, disorganized, and technologically limited, but Watson saw its potential. He accepted the position and immediately began applying the sales and management techniques he had learned from Patterson, adapted to his own vision of a more ethical and paternalistic corporate culture.

Watson's transformation of CTR was swift and dramatic. Within four years of becoming president, he had doubled revenues to $9 million.[^23] In 1924, reflecting his global ambitions, Watson renamed the company International Business Machines Corporation—IBM.[^24] The new name was audacious for a company that was still relatively small, but Watson was building for the future, creating not just a business but an institution that would dominate the emerging information technology industry for decades to come.

## Major Achievements

Thomas Watson Sr.'s forty-two-year leadership of IBM represents one of the most successful corporate transformations in American business history. When he took control of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company in 1914, it was a small operation with fewer than 1,400 employees and revenues under $5 million.[^25] When he died in 1956, IBM employed 72,500 people worldwide and generated revenues of $897 million—a nearly 180-fold increase.[^26] This extraordinary growth was the result of Watson's visionary leadership, relentless focus on sales excellence, and pioneering corporate management practices.

Watson's primary achievement was building IBM into the world's dominant provider of business machines, particularly punched-card tabulating equipment. He recognized early that businesses, governments, and institutions had enormous needs for data processing, census tabulation, accounting, and inventory management—needs that IBM's Hollerith punch-card machines could uniquely address.[^27] Rather than selling machines outright, Watson pioneered a leasing model that created recurring revenue streams and ensured customer dependency on IBM for ongoing service and support.[^28] This business model proved extraordinarily profitable and gave IBM deep, long-term relationships with major clients in banking, insurance, government, and manufacturing.

Watson transformed IBM into what he called "a highly effective selling organization," built on principles he had learned from John Henry Patterson but refined to create a distinctly IBM corporate culture.[^29] He insisted that IBM salesmen dress professionally in dark suits and white shirts—creating the stereotype of the "IBM man" that persisted for decades.[^30] He gave motivational pep talks, established rigorous training programs, and created a system of sales territories, quotas, and incentives that made IBM's sales force the envy of American industry.[^31] In 1918, just four years after Watson arrived, seventy managers enrolled in IBM's first executive training program.[^32] By 1932, Watson had opened the IBM Schoolhouse for employee education, institutionalizing the company's commitment to professional development.[^33]

Watson's famous "THINK" motto became IBM's defining cultural symbol. When asked what he meant by the slogan, Watson replied, "By THINK I mean take everything into consideration. I refuse to make the sign more specific. If a man just sees THINK, he'll find out what I mean."[^34] The word appeared on signs in every IBM office, was embossed on employee notebooks, and became the title of IBM's employee magazine.[^35] This simple five-letter word encapsulated Watson's belief that intellectual effort, careful planning, and systematic thinking could solve any business problem—a philosophy that proved remarkably effective in building both products and organizational capabilities.

Beyond sales and culture, Watson demonstrated remarkable foresight about the international potential of the data processing business. In 1949, he created the IBM World Trade Corporation to focus the company's international expansion efforts, recognizing that IBM's future lay not just in the American market but globally.[^36] By the time of his death, IBM operated in dozens of countries, with particularly strong positions in Europe and Latin America, validating Watson's decision to name the company "International" Business Machines three decades earlier.

Watson also proved to be a committed supporter of research and development, even during IBM's early years when resources were limited. In 1945, he funded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University, which served as a crucible for applying computational expertise to complex scientific problems.[^37] This investment in fundamental research helped position IBM to capitalize on the emerging computer revolution. Although Watson Sr. himself was initially skeptical of electronic computers—having built his fortune on electromechanical tabulating equipment—his support for the research that would enable IBM's later dominance in mainframe computing was crucial.[^38]

Watson's paternalistic approach to employee relations became legendary. He provided IBM workers with benefits far exceeding industry standards: competitive salaries, job security, country clubs, educational opportunities, and various forms of family support.[^39] Like several large companies at the time, IBM offered these generous benefits partly to discourage unionization, but Watson genuinely believed in treating employees well and creating what he called a "corporate family."[^40] This welfare capitalist model integrated IBM into the larger movement of progressive American companies attempting to create loyalty and productivity through benefits rather than coercion.

In recognition of his business achievements and international stature, Watson was elected president of the International Chamber of Commerce in 1937, becoming a prominent spokesperson for international trade and cooperation during an increasingly troubled period of global politics.[^41] By 1941, his success had made him one of the highest-paid executives in America, receiving the third-highest salary and compensation package in the United States at $517,221—an enormous sum during the Great Depression era.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his business achievements, Thomas Watson Sr.'s legacy is deeply tarnished by IBM's extensive business relationship with Nazi Germany before and during World War II. This collaboration, detailed exhaustively in Edwin Black's 2001 book "IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation," remains one of the most disturbing chapters in American corporate history.[^43] Black's meticulously documented research demonstrates that Watson personally approved and directed IBM's strategic technological relationship with Hitler's regime, providing the punch-card tabulating systems that facilitated the Holocaust's bureaucratic machinery.[^44]

IBM's German subsidiary, Dehomag, provided critical data processing services to the Nazi regime beginning in the early 1930s. The Hollerith punch-card machines enabled the Nazis to conduct detailed census operations that identified Jews and other targeted populations with unprecedented precision.[^45] Black's research shows that every concentration camp maintained a Hollerith department to track prisoners, and that the camps could not have processed their staggering numbers without IBM's machines, ongoing technical service, and specially designed punch cards.[^46] The technology facilitated not just identification but the entire logistics of genocide: train traffic management to the camps, military supply coordination, and the systematic tracking of murders.

Watson's personal involvement went beyond passive corporate oversight. Black reports that Watson personally authorized new investments in Dehomag, raising IBM's capital in Germany from 400,000 to 7 million Reichsmarks as the Nazi regime consolidated power.[^47] Germany soon became IBM's second-largest market, generating enormous profits throughout the 1930s.[^48] In 1937, at the height of Nazi persecution of Jews, Watson accepted the Merit Cross of the German Eagle with Star from Adolf Hitler—the highest decoration Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner—in recognition of IBM's contributions to the regime.[^49]

Watson's defenders note that he returned the medal in 1940 after American public opinion had turned decisively against Germany, suggesting some moral discomfort.[^50] However, IBM's business relationship with Nazi Germany continued through subsidiaries and neutral countries even after the United States entered the war, with evidence suggesting that Watson was aware of at least some of these ongoing connections.[^51] The question of Watson's knowledge about how IBM technology was being used in the Holocaust remains debated—Black argues Watson was clearly informed about the general purposes while some scholars suggest the full extent may have been obscured—but his willingness to profit from the Nazi regime is undeniable.

Beyond the Nazi Germany controversy, Watson faced significant antitrust challenges from the U.S. government. By the early 1950s, IBM had achieved overwhelming dominance in the data processing industry, owning and leasing to customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States.[^52] In 1952, the federal government filed a major civil antitrust suit against IBM, arguing that the company's leasing practices, bundling of services, and market power constituted illegal monopolization.[^53] This was not Watson's first encounter with antitrust law—his conviction at NCR decades earlier had nearly destroyed his career—and the new case cast a shadow over his final years at IBM.

Watson also faced criticism for his reluctance to embrace electronic computing, despite IBM's research investments. Having built his fortune on electromechanical punch-card tabulators, Watson Sr. "repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable," except for specialized one-of-a-kind projects.[^54] This technological conservatism nearly cost IBM its future dominance, and it was only through the persistent advocacy of his son, Thomas Watson Jr., that IBM committed to building the electronic mainframe computers that would define the company's next era.[^55] Watson Sr.'s hesitation reflected both his age—he was in his seventies during the early computer era—and his natural caution about abandoning the proven business model that had made his fortune.

Critics have also questioned Watson's paternalistic management style, which created intense loyalty but also demanded conformity and discouraged independent thinking in some respects. The strict dress codes, company songs, sales rallies, and intensive corporate culture could be stifling, creating what some described as a cult-like atmosphere.[^56] While employees enjoyed excellent benefits and job security, they were expected to subsume their individuality to IBM's corporate identity in ways that would be considered excessive by later standards.

## Personal Life

Thomas Watson Sr. married Jeanette Kittredge on April 17, 1913, just as he was leaving National Cash Register under the cloud of his antitrust conviction.[^57] Jeanette came from a prominent Dayton, Ohio, railroad family, and the marriage represented an important social connection for the ambitious but temporarily disgraced Watson.[^58] The partnership would last forty-three years until Watson's death, and Jeanette proved to be a crucial partner in his business and philanthropic endeavors.

Together, Thomas and Jeanette had four children, all of whom would achieve significant prominence in their own right. Their eldest son, Thomas Watson Jr., succeeded his father as IBM chairman and transformed the company into a global technology giant during the electronic computer era, later serving as United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union under President Jimmy Carter.[^59] Their second son, Arthur K. Watson, served as president of IBM World Trade Corporation and later as United States Ambassador to France.[^60] Their daughter Jeanette Watson Irwin married businessman John N. Irwin II, who also became Ambassador to France, while their youngest daughter Helen Watson Buckner became an important philanthropist in New York City.[^61]

Upon Watson's death in 1956, Jeanette was appointed to IBM's board of directors, becoming one of the first women to assume such a role in a major public corporation—a testament both to her own capabilities and to the respect she commanded within the company her husband had built.[^62] The appointment also reflected the Watson family's continuing control over IBM's direction and culture.

Watson's personality combined intense ambition with genuine paternalism. He was described as "an exceptional salesman and organizer" who could inspire fierce loyalty among his employees through a combination of generous benefits, motivational speeches, and personal attention.[^63] He enforced strict standards of professional dress and comportment, famously requiring IBM salesmen to wear dark suits and white shirts, creating the enduring image of the buttoned-down "IBM man."[^64] Yet he also gave personal attention to employees' problems, visited IBM facilities regularly, and genuinely believed in creating a corporate family atmosphere.

Beyond IBM, Watson was deeply engaged in civic affairs and philanthropy. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America, serving on the national executive board in the 1940s and for a time as an international Scout commissioner.[^65] At an international Scout commissioners' meeting in Switzerland, Watson demonstrated characteristic modesty, asking not to be put on a pedestal and sitting by the campfire in Scout uniform alongside the other commissioners.[^66] This combination of corporate power and personal humility reflected Watson's complex character—he could be autocratic in business but genuinely valued service and community engagement.

Watson remained emotionally attached to his rural New York roots throughout his life, continuing to own and enjoy the family farm in Campbell where he was born.[^67] In 1955, near the end of his life, Watson and Jeanette gave the farm, along with one million dollars, to the Methodist Church for use as a retreat and conference center, to be named Watson Homestead in memory of his parents.[^68] This gift reflected Watson's Methodist faith and his desire to honor the modest family circumstances from which he had risen to extraordinary wealth and power.

Watson's health declined in 1956, and he retired from IBM in May of that year, just weeks before his death.[^69] He died on June 19, 1956, in Manhattan, New York City, and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.[^70] His death came at a pivotal moment for IBM—just as his son was steering the company decisively into electronic computing—and marked the end of the electromechanical tabulating era that Watson Sr. had dominated for four decades.

## Legacy

Thomas Watson Sr.'s impact on American business, corporate culture, and the information technology industry proved both profound and enduring, establishing management principles and organizational practices that influenced generations of business leaders worldwide. At his death, Watson was widely recognized as having created "a model corporation for the 20th century," pioneering approaches to sales management, employee relations, and corporate culture that became standard practice across American industry.[^71]

Watson's most visible legacy was the IBM corporation itself, which under his leadership became synonymous with business computing and data processing. The company's dominance in mainframe computers during the 1960s and 1970s—captured in the industry saying that "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"—was built on the foundation of customer relationships, service excellence, and market presence that Watson established during the punch-card tabulating era.[^72] His decision to lease rather than sell equipment created recurring revenue streams and customer dependency that became the model for later technology companies, from Xerox's copier business to modern software-as-a-service models.

The "THINK" motto that Watson brought from NCR and made synonymous with IBM became one of the most recognizable corporate slogans in history, symbolizing a culture that valued intellectual rigor and systematic problem-solving.[^73] The slogan's influence extended far beyond IBM—it was appropriated and adapted by countless other companies, and Apple Computer's famous "Think Different" campaign in the 1990s deliberately invoked and subverted Watson's original formulation.[^74] Watson's belief that culture could be systematically designed and propagated through symbols, rituals, and language anticipated modern understanding of organizational culture by several decades.

Watson's paternalistic management philosophy, which provided exceptional benefits in exchange for loyalty and conformity, profoundly influenced corporate practices globally. Scholars note that "Watson's paternalistic outlook has proved influential far beyond his own empire: the current successful Japanese management culture is based on IBM's policies," particularly the emphasis on lifetime employment, intensive training, and company loyalty.[^75] While this model has declined in the United States since the 1980s, its legacy remains visible in how companies think about employee development and organizational culture.

In the broader history of computing, Watson occupies a unique position as "one of those figures in the history of computing whose contributions are by no means technological but without whom the technologists would not have been able to proceed."[^76] Watson was not an inventor or engineer—he barely understood the technical details of the machines IBM produced—but he created the commercial infrastructure and market demand that made large-scale computing economically viable. His funding of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in 1945 helped train the generation of scientists and engineers who would design the electronic computers of the 1950s and 1960s.[^77]

However, Watson's legacy is permanently shadowed by IBM's collaboration with Nazi Germany. Edwin Black's extensive documentation of how IBM technology facilitated the Holocaust has ensured that Watson cannot be remembered simply as a business visionary but must also be confronted as someone who profited from one of history's greatest crimes.[^78] The controversy continues to generate scholarly debate about corporate responsibility, the ethics of international business during wartime, and the limits of claiming ignorance about how one's products are used. Black's book has become required reading in business ethics courses, ensuring that Watson's moral failures are studied alongside his business achievements.

The Watson name continues in numerous institutions and programs. The Thomas J. Watson Foundation, established by his children in 1961, provides fellowships for graduating college seniors to pursue independent study and travel abroad.[^79] Watson's commitment to international understanding and education, despite the Nazi Germany controversy, inspired this program which has supported thousands of students over six decades. Additionally, IBM's Watson artificial intelligence system, introduced in 2011 and famous for winning the quiz show Jeopardy!, carries his name into the 21st century, though the technology would have been unimaginable to Watson Sr. himself.

Watson's transformation from a convicted antitrust violator to one of America's most respected business leaders demonstrates both the possibilities of redemption in American capitalism and the ways that enormous success can obscure serious ethical questions. His story remains compelling precisely because it contains both genuine achievement and profound moral failure—a combination that makes him a complex and instructive figure for understanding the relationship between business, ethics, and power in the twentieth century.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and business historians who emphasize Watson's achievements portray him as a transformative figure who fundamentally redefined corporate management for the modern era. Biographer Kevin Maney, author of "The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM," argues that the culture Watson created at IBM was "a whole new species—a great evolutionary leap from what had come before," representing a systematic approach to building organizational identity that went far beyond simple profit maximization.[^80] Maney emphasizes that Watson seemed conscious of creating something bigger than himself, building culture "in a more systematic and personal way" than previous industrialists had attempted.[^81]

Supporters highlight Watson's genuine commitment to employee welfare at a time when most American corporations treated workers as disposable resources. The Computer History Museum recognizes Watson's pioneering role in establishing professional sales organizations and systematic management training, noting that "Watson assembled a highly motivated, well-trained, and well-paid staff" that set new standards for how corporations could develop human capital.[^82] His insistence on education, training, and career development created pathways for working-class Americans to achieve middle-class prosperity through corporate employment—a significant democratizing force in mid-twentieth-century America.

Watson's defenders also emphasize his contributions to international business cooperation and his genuine belief in using commerce as a force for peace. His election as president of the International Chamber of Commerce in 1937 reflected widespread recognition of his commitment to international trade and understanding.[^83] The Thomas J. Watson Foundation established by his children continues this legacy, supporting educational exchange and international understanding, suggesting that Watson's family internalized his expressed values about global cooperation even if his business practices sometimes contradicted them.[^84]

From a technological perspective, scholars acknowledge that while Watson himself was not an inventor, his commercial vision and willingness to invest in research created the conditions for computing's development. His 1945 funding of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University, and his eventual acceptance of his son's advocacy for electronic computers, positioned IBM to dominate the mainframe era even though Watson Sr. personally remained skeptical of the technology.[^85] Without Watson's decades of building customer relationships, service infrastructure, and market presence, IBM might not have been positioned to capitalize on the computer revolution.

Business ethicists who take a more forgiving view argue that Watson operated according to the standards of his time, when international business with authoritarian regimes was common and the full extent of Nazi atrocities was not widely known until after World War II. They note his return of Hitler's medal in 1940 as evidence of moral evolution, and point out that many American corporations maintained German operations during the 1930s.[^86] Some scholars suggest that Black's "IBM and the Holocaust" overstates Watson's personal knowledge and control over Dehomag's specific activities, arguing that the subsidiary operated with considerable autonomy in ways Watson may not have fully understood or approved.

### Negative Views

Critics of Watson, led by investigative journalist Edwin Black, present a damning portrait of a man whose "pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany," making him complicit in facilitating the Holocaust through technology.[^87] Black's exhaustive archival research demonstrates that Watson was not a passive or ignorant participant but actively directed IBM's expansion in Germany, personally approved major investments even as Nazi persecution escalated, and accepted Hitler's highest civilian honor in 1937 while the regime's murderous intentions were already clear.[^88]

Black and other scholars reject the argument that Watson didn't know how IBM technology was being used, noting that the company maintained close technical relationships with Dehomag, that Hollerith machines required ongoing service and customization for specific applications, and that the purposes for census data and population tracking in Nazi Germany were obvious to any informed observer.[^89] They point out that Watson's return of the medal in 1940 came only after American public opinion had turned decisively against Germany, suggesting pragmatic public relations rather than moral awakening. IBM's continued business relationships through subsidiaries and neutral countries during the war years further undermines claims of ignorance or ethical restraint.[^90]

From a technological perspective, critics note that Watson's conservatism and resistance to electronic computing nearly cost IBM its future. Historians document that "Watson Sr. had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable," clinging to the electromechanical tabulating technology that had made his fortune even as the industry was clearly moving toward electronic systems.[^91] Only his son's persistent advocacy and eventual assumption of leadership saved IBM from technological obsolescence. This reluctance reveals Watson's limitations as a visionary—he was masterful at exploiting existing technologies and building markets, but resistant to fundamental innovation that threatened his proven business model.

Labor historians and critics of corporate power challenge the benign interpretation of Watson's paternalism, arguing that his generous benefits were designed primarily to prevent unionization and maintain autocratic control over workers. They note that "like several large companies at the time, IBM gave its employees a wealth of benefits as long as they refused to join labor unions," making Watson's welfare capitalism a sophisticated form of union-busting rather than genuine concern for workers.[^92] The strict dress codes, mandatory corporate songs, and intensive cultural indoctrination created what some scholars describe as a corporate cult that demanded conformity and suppressed independent thought.

The antitrust cases that bookended Watson's career—his conviction at NCR in 1912 and the federal suit against IBM in 1952—suggest a consistent pattern of anticompetitive behavior that critics argue reveals Watson's true character as a ruthless monopolist willing to break laws to maintain market dominance.[^93] While Watson's NCR conviction was overturned on appeal due to procedural issues rather than innocence, and the 1952 IBM case was settled with a consent decree, critics see these episodes as evidence that Watson's business success was built as much on market power and anticompetitive practices as on superior products or service.

Contemporary assessments increasingly emphasize that Watson cannot be understood through a simple hero-or-villain framework. Richard Bernstein's review of Black's book in The New York Times Book Review noted that while Black's case about IBM and the Holocaust is "long and heavily documented," he "does not demonstrate that IBM bears some unique or decisive responsibility for the evil that was done," since the Holocaust would have proceeded with or without IBM technology, albeit perhaps less efficiently.[^94] This observation captures the complexity of Watson's legacy: clearly complicit in profiting from atrocity, but not singularly responsible for causing it; genuinely innovative in business practices, but also monopolistic and anticompetitive; paternalistic toward employees, but also manipulative and controlling.
