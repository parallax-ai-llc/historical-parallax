## Summary
Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer, known as the "Milwaukee Cannibal," was an American serial killer and sex offender who committed the murder and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. His crimes involved necrophilia, cannibalism, and the preservation of body parts. Dahmer was convicted in 1992 and sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms before being beaten to death in prison in 1994.

## Early Life
Jeffrey Dahmer was born on May 21, 1960, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer. His childhood was marked by his parents' turbulent marriage and his growing fascination with dead animals. The family moved to Bath, Ohio, where Dahmer attended Revere High School. He was described as an intelligent but disengaged student who developed alcohol dependency at a young age. After briefly attending Ohio State University, he enlisted in the U.S. Army but was discharged for alcoholism. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Dahmer committed his first murder in 1978, killing hitchhiker Steven Hicks in Bath, Ohio. After a nine-year hiatus, he resumed killing in 1987 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He lured young men to his apartment, drugged them, and performed various acts of torture, murder, and dismemberment. He attempted crude lobotomies on some victims in an effort to create "zombies." He kept photographs and preserved body parts as trophies. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
On July 22, 1991, Tracy Edwards escaped from Dahmer's apartment and flagged down police. Officers discovered photographs of dismembered bodies and human remains in the apartment. Dahmer confessed to 17 murders. He was found guilty of 15 counts of murder in Wisconsin and one in Ohio. On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by fellow inmate Christopher Scarver at the Columbia Correctional Institution. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Expressed genuine remorse during his trial and accepted responsibility for his crimes [^4]
- His case prompted reforms in how police handle missing persons reports, particularly for minority communities
- His father Lionel's memoir provided valuable psychological insights for criminologists

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered and dismembered 17 men and boys over a 13-year period [^5]
- Engaged in cannibalism, necrophilia, and preservation of human remains
- Police failures in his case highlighted racial bias — officers returned a 14-year-old Laotian victim (Konerak Sinthasomphone) to Dahmer despite obvious signs of abuse
- Caused profound trauma to victims' families and the Milwaukee community
- His crimes were particularly targeted at young men of color
