## Summary

Osborne Reynolds made foundational contributions to fluid mechanics, introducing the Reynolds number — a dimensionless quantity that predicts flow patterns in different fluid situations. He also developed Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for turbulent flow. His work is fundamental to modern engineering in aerodynamics, hydraulics, and chemical processing.
