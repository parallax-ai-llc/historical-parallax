## Overview

The Battle of Guadalcanal (Codename: **Operation Watchtower**) was the first major Allied land offensive against the Empire of Japan. Marines landed on the jungle island of Guadalcanal to seize a Japanese airfield (Henderson Field) that threatened supply lines to Australia. What was expected to be a quick operation turned into a brutal six-month campaign of attrition on land, at sea, and in the air. It was a "triphibious" campaign where control of the sea determined the fate of the land battle. The Japanese defeat marked the transition from their offensive expansion to a defensive struggle for survival.

## The Battle

### Phase 1: The Landing (Aug 7)
Marines landed unopposed. Japanese laborers fled.
Marines captured the airfield and named it **Henderson Field**.
**Naval Disaster:** That night, Japanese navy attacked (*Battle of Savo Island*). Sunk 4 Allied cruisers. US Navy withdrew transport ships, leaving Marines stranded with half supplies.

### Phase 2: Banzai Attacks (Aug - Oct)
Japanese strategy: Land reinforcements at night via destroyers (**Tokyo Express**), then launch frontal bayonet charges to retake airfield.
**Battle of the Tenaru (Aug 21):**
Col. Ichiki led 900 men. Charged Marine machine guns.
Result: ~777 Japanese dead. ~35 Marines dead. First lesson in "Japanese don't surrender."
**Battle of Edson's Ridge (Bloody Ridge) (Sept 12-14):**
3,000 Japanese vs 800 Marine Raiders.
Vicious hand-to-hand fighting. Marines held.

### Phase 3: Naval Attrition
Control of waters:
- **Daytime:** US ruled (Cactus Air Force planes).
- **Nighttime:** Japan ruled (Superior night optics/torpedoes).
So many ships were sunk in the slot between islands that it was named **Ironbottom Sound**.
(2 Battleships, 8 Cruisers, 14 Destroyers lost by US).
