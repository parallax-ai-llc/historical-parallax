## Summary

Saint Paul, originally known as Saul of Tarsus, was one of the most influential figures in early Christianity and arguably the most important Christian missionary and theologian after Jesus Christ himself. Born a Roman citizen and educated as a Pharisee, Paul initially persecuted early Christians before experiencing a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus that transformed him into Christianity's greatest advocate.[^1] Through his extensive missionary journeys across the Roman Empire, he established numerous Christian communities and wrote epistles that comprise nearly half of the New Testament.[^2] His theological writings on grace, faith, salvation, and the relationship between Jewish law and Christian belief fundamentally shaped Christian doctrine for two millennia.[^3] Despite controversies surrounding his views on women, slavery, and authority, Paul remains venerated as a saint in multiple Christian denominations and recognized as a pivotal architect of Christian theology.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Paul was born around 5 CE in Tarsus, a major city in the Roman province of Cilicia (modern-day Turkey), to Jewish parents of the tribe of Benjamin.[^5] His birth name was Saul, named after the first king of Israel, and he possessed the prestigious status of Roman citizenship, likely inherited from his father.[^6] This dual identity as both a devout Jew and Roman citizen would prove crucial to his later ministry, allowing him to navigate both Jewish and Gentile worlds with unique authority.[^7]

Tarsus was a cosmopolitan center of Greek learning and culture, exposing young Saul to Hellenistic philosophy and rhetoric that would later influence his theological arguments and persuasive writing style.[^8] Despite this Greek cultural environment, Paul's family maintained strict adherence to Jewish traditions and the Pharisaic interpretation of the Torah.[^9] According to his own testimony in his letters, Paul was "circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee."[^10]

As a young man, Paul traveled to Jerusalem to study under Gamaliel the Elder, one of the most respected rabbinical teachers of the era and a leading member of the Sanhedrin.[^11] This rigorous education in Jewish law, scripture, and Pharisaic tradition made Paul exceptionally qualified in Jewish theology and biblical interpretation.[^12] He became zealous for the traditions of his ancestors and distinguished himself among his peers in his devotion to the law.[^13] This educational background would later enable him to argue theological points with remarkable sophistication and cite Hebrew scriptures with authority when defending Christian doctrine.[^14]

Paul also learned the trade of tentmaking, following the Jewish custom that even scholars should have a practical skill to support themselves.[^15] This occupation would later prove valuable during his missionary work, allowing him to support himself financially rather than depend entirely on the communities he served.[^16] His upbringing in Tarsus, education in Jerusalem, Roman citizenship, and trade skills collectively equipped Paul with a unique set of tools that would make him an extraordinarily effective missionary to both Jews and Gentiles across the Roman Empire.[^17]

## Rise to Prominence

Paul's initial prominence in the historical record comes from his role as a fierce persecutor of early Christians. Following the stoning of Stephen, the first Christian martyr, around 34 CE, Paul became a leading figure in the campaign to suppress the growing Christian movement in Jerusalem.[^18] The Book of Acts describes him as "breathing murderous threats against the Lord's disciples," obtaining authorization from the high priest to arrest Christians in Damascus and bring them bound to Jerusalem.[^19] This zealous persecution stemmed from his conviction that the Christian claim that Jesus was the Messiah constituted blasphemy against Jewish law.[^20]

The pivotal moment in Paul's life occurred on the road to Damascus, where, according to Acts, he experienced a dramatic vision of the resurrected Jesus.[^21] This encounter, which Paul himself references in his letters, involved a blinding light and a voice asking, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"[^22] Struck blind for three days, Paul was led to Damascus where a Christian disciple named Ananias restored his sight and baptized him.[^23] This conversion experience, occurring approximately 33-36 CE, transformed Paul from Christianity's greatest enemy to its most ardent advocate.[^24]

Following his conversion, Paul spent three years in Arabia and Damascus, during which scholars believe he developed his theological understanding of Christ and formulated his missionary approach.[^25] He then traveled to Jerusalem to meet with Peter and James, the brother of Jesus, seeking recognition from the original apostles.[^26] Though initially met with suspicion due to his reputation as a persecutor, Paul was eventually accepted by the Jerusalem church leadership, though tensions over his approach to Gentile converts would persist.[^27]

Paul's rise to prominence as a Christian missionary began in earnest when Barnabas brought him to Antioch, where a thriving multi-ethnic Christian community was emerging.[^28] The church at Antioch commissioned Paul and Barnabas for missionary work around 47 CE, launching Paul's first major journey throughout Asia Minor.[^29] His innovative strategy of preaching first in synagogues to reach both Jews and "God-fearing" Gentiles, then establishing independent Christian communities, proved remarkably successful.[^30] His willingness to fully embrace Gentile converts without requiring circumcision or full observance of Jewish law distinguished him from other early Christian leaders and expanded Christianity's appeal throughout the Roman world.[^31]

## Major Achievements

Paul's most significant achievement was establishing Christianity as a universal religion transcending its Jewish origins. Through three major missionary journeys spanning approximately 46-57 CE, Paul founded Christian communities throughout Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Greece, including major urban centers like Corinth, Ephesus, Philippi, and Thessalonica.[^32] His strategic focus on establishing churches in major cities along Roman trade routes enabled Christianity to spread rapidly throughout the empire's communication networks.[^33] Scholars estimate Paul traveled over 10,000 miles during his missionary career, an extraordinary feat for the ancient world.[^34]

Paul's theological writings constitute perhaps his most enduring achievement. Of the 27 books in the New Testament, 13 are traditionally attributed to Paul, though modern scholars debate the authorship of some.[^35] His epistles to various churches addressed theological controversies, provided ethical guidance, and articulated Christian doctrine with philosophical sophistication.[^36] The Letter to the Romans, considered Paul's theological masterpiece, presents a systematic exposition of Christian salvation theology that has influenced Christian thought for two millennia.[^37] His letters to the Corinthians addressed practical church matters while developing profound theological concepts about love, resurrection, and the nature of Christian community.[^38]

Central to Paul's theological achievement was his articulation of salvation through faith in Christ rather than adherence to Jewish law. His teaching that both Jews and Gentiles could be justified before God through faith in Jesus Christ, apart from works of the law, fundamentally redefined the requirements for joining God's covenant community.[^39] This doctrine of justification by faith became the cornerstone of Protestant theology during the Reformation and remains central to Christian soteriology.[^40] Paul's theological formulation allowed Christianity to break free from its origins as a Jewish sect and become accessible to the entire Gentile world.[^41]

Paul successfully navigated the critical theological dispute over whether Gentile converts needed to observe Jewish law, particularly circumcision. At the Jerusalem Council around 50 CE, Paul argued persuasively that Gentile believers should not be required to undergo circumcision or follow the full Mosaic law.[^42] This decision, described in Acts 15, represented a watershed moment that enabled Christianity's rapid expansion among non-Jews while maintaining fellowship with Jewish Christians.[^43] Paul's diplomatic skills and theological arguments were instrumental in preventing a potentially devastating split in the early church.[^44]

Additionally, Paul developed influential teachings on numerous theological topics including the nature of Christ, the role of the Holy Spirit, Christian ethics, church organization, and eschatology.[^45] His metaphors of the church as the "body of Christ" and Christians as members of that body have shaped ecclesiology for centuries.[^46] His famous discourse on love in 1 Corinthians 13—"Love is patient, love is kind"—remains one of the most quoted and beloved passages in all of Christian literature.[^47] His teachings on spiritual gifts, resurrection, marriage, and the relationship between freedom and responsibility continue to influence Christian theology and practice worldwide.[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Paul's views on women in the church have generated substantial controversy and criticism, particularly in modern times. Passages in 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 stating that women should "remain silent in the churches" and 1 Timothy 2:12 declaring "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man" have been used to justify the exclusion of women from church leadership for centuries.[^49] Feminist scholars and theologians have criticized these teachings as reflecting patriarchal attitudes that contradict the more egalitarian vision suggested by Paul's statement in Galatians 3:28 that in Christ "there is neither male nor female."[^50] Some scholars argue these restrictive passages may be later interpolations rather than Paul's authentic teaching, while others defend them as contextually appropriate for first-century culture.[^51]

Paul's apparent acceptance of slavery has troubled many readers and critics. His letter to Philemon, while urging the Christian slave owner to receive his runaway slave Onesimus "no longer as a slave, but as a dear brother," stops short of explicitly condemning the institution of slavery itself.[^52] Ephesians 6:5 and Colossians 3:22 instruct slaves to "obey your earthly masters," though Paul also commands masters to treat slaves justly.[^53] These passages were infamously used by pro-slavery advocates in America to justify slavery as biblically sanctioned.[^54] Critics argue that Paul missed an opportunity to explicitly denounce slavery as incompatible with Christian ethics, while defenders contend he was promoting a revolutionary equality within the spiritual community that would eventually undermine slavery's foundations.[^55]

Paul's relationship with the original apostles in Jerusalem, particularly Peter and James, was marked by significant tensions. The confrontation at Antioch, where Paul publicly rebuked Peter for withdrawing from eating with Gentile Christians, reveals deep disagreements over how Jewish law applied to Christian practice.[^56] Some scholars argue Paul's independent authority claim—that his gospel came "by revelation of Jesus Christ" rather than through the Jerusalem apostles—created friction with those who had known Jesus during his earthly ministry.[^57] Critics suggest Paul's theology departed significantly from Jesus's original teaching, while supporters argue he faithfully developed the implications of Jesus's message for a Gentile audience.[^58]

Paul's emphasis on obedience to governmental authorities in Romans 13:1-7 has been criticized as promoting authoritarian submission. The passage commanding "everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established" was cited by Nazi sympathizers during World War II and has been used to discourage Christian resistance to oppressive regimes.[^59] Liberation theologians and political activists have challenged this teaching as insufficiently critical of unjust power structures, arguing it contradicts the prophetic tradition of challenging corrupt authorities.[^60]

Some scholars have questioned Paul's influence on Christianity, arguing he fundamentally altered Jesus's message from a simple ethical teaching focused on God's kingdom to a complex theological system centered on Christ's death and resurrection.[^61] Jewish scholars and some historians have criticized Paul for creating a "Gentile Christianity" that severed the religion from its Jewish roots and contributed to later Christian anti-Semitism.[^62] His harsh rhetoric against "Judaizers" and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Jewish have been examined as potentially laying groundwork for later Christian persecution of Jews, though defenders argue Paul remained deeply committed to his Jewish identity and hoped for Israel's salvation.[^63]

## Personal Life

Details about Paul's personal life are relatively sparse, gleaned primarily from occasional references in his letters and the Acts of the Apostles. He appears to have been unmarried during his missionary career, stating in 1 Corinthians 7:8 that he wished others could remain single like him, though some scholars debate whether he might have been widowed.[^64] Paul viewed his celibate state as advantageous for ministry, allowing him to devote himself fully to spreading the gospel without family obligations, though he affirmed marriage as honorable and necessary for those who could not maintain self-control.[^65]

Paul suffered from some kind of physical ailment he described as a "thorn in my flesh" in 2 Corinthians 12:7-9, about which he prayed unsuccessfully for relief.[^66] Scholars have speculated this might have been an eye disease, epilepsy, malaria, or chronic pain, though the exact nature remains unknown.[^67] In Galatians 4:13-15, Paul mentions that illness originally brought him to the Galatians, and suggests they would have given him their own eyes if possible, leading some to theorize vision problems.[^68] Rather than viewing this affliction as purely negative, Paul interpreted it as keeping him humble and demonstrating Christ's power through his weakness.[^69]

The Book of Acts describes Paul as an effective public speaker, though his own letters suggest others criticized his speaking ability. In 2 Corinthians 10:10, Paul quotes critics who said "his letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing."[^70] This apparent disconnect between his powerful written communication and less impressive oral presentation has intrigued scholars, with some suggesting he may have lacked the rhetorical polish valued in Greco-Roman culture despite his persuasive content.[^71]

Paul's personality emerges from his letters as passionate, intense, and occasionally volatile. He could be tender and affectionate, calling the Thessalonians his "glory and joy" and comparing himself to a nursing mother caring for her children.[^72] Yet he could also be sharply confrontational, sarcastically wishing that those promoting circumcision would "go the whole way and emasculate themselves" in Galatians 5:12.[^73] This emotional range, combined with his vulnerability about his weaknesses and sufferings, creates a remarkably human portrait of a driven religious leader.[^74]

According to his own testimony, Paul endured extraordinary hardships including imprisonments, floggings, beatings with rods, stoning, shipwrecks, dangers from bandits and false believers, sleepless nights, hunger, and exposure to harsh elements.[^75] The Book of Acts records his survival of a stoning in Lystra, imprisonment in Philippi with Silas, riots in Ephesus, and a dramatic shipwreck while being transported to Rome as a prisoner.[^76] These experiences shaped his theology of suffering as participation in Christ's sufferings and demonstrated the depth of his commitment to his mission.[^77]

## Legacy

Paul's influence on Christian theology cannot be overstated—his writings have shaped Christian doctrine more than any figure except Jesus himself. His theological concepts of justification by faith, the nature of grace, the relationship between law and gospel, and the universal scope of salvation form the foundation of Christian systematic theology.[^78] The Protestant Reformation was sparked largely by Martin Luther's encounter with Paul's Letter to the Romans, particularly the doctrine of justification by faith alone, demonstrating Paul's continuing power to reshape Christianity even fifteen centuries after his death.[^79] Reformed theology, Lutheranism, and much of evangelical Protestant thought derive their core theological framework from Pauline epistles.[^80]

Paul's missionary methodology established patterns that have influenced Christian missions for two millennia. His strategy of targeting urban centers, establishing self-governing local churches, appointing local leadership, and maintaining connections through letters and visits became the template for subsequent missionary movements.[^81] His example of cross-cultural adaptation—"becoming all things to all people" to win converts—has informed missiological theory and practice from the early church through modern missionary movements.[^82] The rapid expansion of Christianity from a small Jewish sect to a world religion owes much to the precedents Paul established.[^83]

The preservation and canonization of Paul's letters ensured his ongoing influence. Early church fathers like Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, and Polycarp quoted Paul's writings extensively, establishing their authority even before the New Testament canon was formally defined.[^84] When the biblical canon was established in the fourth century, Paul's epistles were unquestioningly included as authoritative scripture.[^85] His letters have been continuously studied, commented upon, and preached from throughout Christian history, making him one of the most analyzed authors in Western civilization.[^86]

Paul is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox churches, and the Anglican Communion, with his feast day celebrated on June 29 alongside Peter.[^87] The Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome, built over his traditional burial site, stands as one of Christianity's most important pilgrimage destinations.[^88] Icons, artwork, and hagiographical traditions depicting Paul—typically shown as bald or balding, with a pointed beard, often holding a sword and book—have made his image instantly recognizable throughout Christian cultures.[^89]

Beyond specifically Christian contexts, Paul's influence extends to Western philosophy, ethics, and political thought. Philosophers from Augustine to Kant to contemporary thinkers like Alain Badiou and Giorgio Agamben have engaged deeply with Pauline concepts.[^90] His reflections on law, grace, freedom, and conscience have contributed to Western legal and moral philosophy.[^91] His vision of a universal community transcending ethnic and social boundaries—"neither Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free, male nor female"—has inspired liberation movements despite the problematic aspects of his specific teachings on these groups.[^92]

Paul's legacy remains contested and complex. While revered by billions as a saint and apostle, his teachings continue to generate debate over gender roles, sexuality, authority, and the relationship between Christianity and Judaism.[^93] His influence on Christian anti-Semitism, despite his own Jewish identity and love for his people, represents a tragic aspect of his legacy.[^94] Nevertheless, as the author of nearly half the New Testament and the primary architect of Christian theology, Paul's impact on world history, culture, and religion remains immeasurable.[^95]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and theologians across Christian traditions have praised Paul as Christianity's greatest theologian and missionary. New Testament scholar N.T. Wright describes Paul as "the most powerful and seminal mind of the first Christian century" whose vision of God's purposes transformed the world.[^96] Wright argues that Paul faithfully developed the implications of Jesus's message rather than distorting it, creating a coherent theological framework that made Christianity accessible to all humanity.[^97] His interpretation emphasizes Paul's Jewish context and his conviction that the Messiah's arrival inaugurated a new phase of God's covenant with Israel that now included Gentiles.[^98]

Catholic tradition has consistently honored Paul as a pillar of the church and foundational theological authority. Pope Benedict XVI's series of general audiences on Paul emphasized his "profound encounter with the Risen Lord" that transformed him into an apostle capable of bringing the gospel to the nations.[^99] The Catholic Church recognizes Paul's essential role in defining Christian identity and his inspired writings as the word of God.[^100] Thomas Aquinas and other medieval theologians drew extensively on Paul's letters to develop systematic theology, treating his writings as authoritative divine revelation.[^101]

Protestant reformers viewed Paul as the greatest expositor of Christian gospel truth. Martin Luther called the Letter to Romans "the most important piece in the New Testament... the purest Gospel" and credited his reading of Paul with his theological breakthrough.[^102] John Calvin's theology was profoundly shaped by Pauline epistles, particularly Paul's teachings on predestination, grace, and divine sovereignty.[^103] The Reformed tradition continues to see Paul as the clearest articulator of salvation by grace through faith, vindicating Protestant theology against works-righteousness.[^104]

Contemporary scholars have highlighted Paul's radical social vision. Theologian J. Louis Martyn argues that Paul's gospel announced an apocalyptic transformation creating a new humanity where traditional social hierarchies were overturned.[^105] Classicist Sarah Ruden, in her book "Paul Among the People," contends that Paul's teachings on sexuality, marriage, and slavery were remarkably progressive for their context, promoting mutual responsibility and dignity contrary to Roman cultural norms.[^106] These scholars see Paul as an agent of social transformation whose full vision has yet to be realized.[^107]

Defenders emphasize Paul's extraordinary courage and dedication. His willingness to endure persecution, imprisonment, and ultimately martyrdom for his convictions demonstrates remarkable integrity and commitment.[^108] His intellectual brilliance in synthesizing Jewish theology, Greek philosophy, and Christian revelation produced a sophisticated theological framework that could engage the ancient world's most educated minds.[^109] His pastoral sensitivity, evident in his tender addresses to his communities and his practical wisdom on church matters, reveals a leader genuinely concerned for his followers' spiritual welfare.[^110]

---

### Negative Views

Feminist theologians and scholars have offered sustained criticism of Paul's influence on Christian teaching about women. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza argues that later church tradition amplified Paul's more restrictive statements while minimizing his more egalitarian passages, using his authority to justify patriarchal church structures.[^111] Feminist critics note that regardless of whether Paul himself intended complete female subordination, his words have been used for centuries to exclude women from leadership, education, and full participation in church life.[^112] Some scholars argue the early Christian movement's initial gender egalitarianism was suppressed partly through selective interpretation of Pauline texts.[^113]

Jewish scholars and some historians have criticized Paul for creating a theology that ultimately contributed to Christian anti-Semitism. Hyam Maccoby argued that Paul corrupted Jesus's original Jewish message, creating a Hellenistic mystery religion foreign to Jesus's teaching.[^114] Critics point to passages where Paul appears to blame Jews collectively for Jesus's death and suggests God has rejected Israel in favor of Gentile Christians.[^115] While Paul himself affirmed God's continuing covenant with Israel in Romans 9-11, his complex arguments about the law and his conflicts with Jewish Christians contributed to later Christian anti-Jewish sentiment.[^116]

Scholars critical of Paul's social ethics argue his acceptance of slavery and hierarchical social structures undermined Christianity's liberating potential. Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche notoriously attacked Paul as representing a "slave morality" that glorified weakness and ressentiment.[^117] More sympathetic critics acknowledge Paul's historical context but argue he failed to draw out the radical egalitarian implications of his own theology.[^118] His instructions for slaves to obey masters and his failure to explicitly condemn slavery allowed Christians to maintain slaveholding with clear consciences for eighteen centuries.[^119]

Some New Testament scholars question whether Paul accurately represented Jesus's original teaching. The "Jesus Seminar" scholars and others have suggested significant discontinuity between Jesus's message focused on God's kingdom and Paul's theology centered on Christ's death and resurrection.[^120] Bart Ehrman and other critical scholars argue Paul had limited knowledge of Jesus's earthly teaching and created a theological system more influenced by Hellenistic religious concepts than by Jesus's actual words.[^121] These scholars see Paul as Christianity's true founder rather than merely an interpreter of Jesus's message.[^122]

Liberation theologians have critiqued Paul's teaching on governmental authority as promoting political quietism. His instruction in Romans 13 to submit to governing authorities has been condemned as supporting the status quo and discouraging Christian resistance to oppression.[^123] Critics note this teaching stands in tension with the prophetic biblical tradition of challenging unjust rulers and with the Christian martyrs' refusal to obey Roman authorities demanding emperor worship.[^124] Some argue Paul's theology, despite its rhetoric of freedom, ultimately served to maintain oppressive social structures by spiritualizing liberation rather than demanding concrete justice.[^125]
