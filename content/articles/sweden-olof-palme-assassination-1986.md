## Summary

On the night of February 28, 1986, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme walked home from a cinema with his wife Lisbeth. He had no bodyguards—Sweden was too safe, too civilized for such precautions. At 11:21 p.m., a man approached them on Sveavägen, one of Stockholm's main streets, and shot Palme in the back. The killer disappeared into the night. Palme died within minutes. Nearly 40 years later, his murder remains officially unsolved.[^1]

The assassination of Olof Palme is one of the greatest unsolved political murders of the 20th century. The investigation, spanning decades, has accumulated 700,000 pages of documentation, explored hundreds of theories, and fundamentally changed Sweden. A man was convicted and then acquitted. In 2020, prosecutors named a prime suspect—who had died 20 years earlier. In 2025, they walked that back. The case is closed, but the murderer has never been brought to justice.[^2]

Who killed Olof Palme? The theories range from a lone madman to elaborate conspiracies involving South African intelligence, the CIA, Kurdish separatists, Swedish police extremists, and weapons dealers. Palme was a controversial figure who criticized apartheid, the Vietnam War, and spoke up for third-world nations—making enemies around the globe. The man who walked up to him on that winter night took those answers to an unmarked grave.[^3]

## The Event

### February 28, 1986

**That evening:**
- Olof Palme (59) and wife Lisbeth went to cinema
- Watched "The Mozart Brothers" at Grand Cinema
- No bodyguard protection (Palme often declined)
- Walked home afterward

**11:21 p.m.:**
- Sveavägen/Tunnelgatan intersection
- Man approached from behind
- **Shot Palme in the back** (close range)
- Second shot grazed Lisbeth
- Shooter fled down Tunnelgatan steps
- Disappeared into the night

**11:30 p.m.:**
- Palme pronounced dead at scene (later hospital)
- Sweden woke to unimaginable news: Their prime minister had been murdered

**He was the first Western European leader assassinated since World War II.**[^4]

### The Murder Scene

**Key details:**
- Revolver used (.357 Magnum ammunition)
- Weapon never found
- Shooter appeared to wait for good shot
- Fled on foot; possibly escaped in car
- Cold, snowy night

**Witnesses:**
- Several people saw the shooter

## Who Was Olof Palme?

### A Controversial Leader

**Political career:**
- Social Democratic leader
- Prime Minister: 1969-1976, 1982-1986
- Architect of Swedish welfare state
- Strong international profile

**What made him enemies:**

| Issue | Palme's Position | Who Was Angry |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Vietnam War | Compared US bombing to Nazi atrocities | United States |
| South African apartheid | Fierce critic; supported ANC | South African government |
| Cold War | Independent; criticized both superpowers | CIA, some Swedish military |
| Middle East | Sympathized with Palestinians | Some Israeli/Jewish groups |
| Soviet Union | Criticized Soviet actions | Soviets (though less than US) |

**He was perhaps the most internationally outspoken leader of any small nation—and that made him a target.**[^6]

---

## The Investigation

### Initial Chaos

**Early problems:**
- Crime scene poorly secured
- Witnesses not immediately interviewed
- Police unprepared for political assassination
- Sweden had no experience with this

### Christer Pettersson

**1988: A suspect:**
- Pettersson: alcoholic, drug user, prior manslaughter conviction
- Identified by Lisbeth Palme in lineup
- **Convicted of murder (1988)**

**1989: Acquitted on appeal:**
- No murder weapon
- No clear motive
- Lineup identification questioned
- Released

**Pettersson later (died 2004):**
- Some claimed he confessed
- Said he thought Palme was drug dealer (mistaken identity?)
- Never conclusively proven
- Denied officially until death

**Status:** Still a suspect for many; never proven[^7]

### The "Skandia Man": Stig Engström

**2020 announcement:**
- Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson closed case
- Named **Stig Engström** as most likely killer
- Engström: Graphic designer at nearby insurance company
- First witness at scene; gave extensive interviews
- Had extreme anti-Palme views
- Died 2000 (suicide)

**The case:**
- Engström couldn't be prosecuted (dead)
- Case closed officially

**2025: Walked back:**
- New prosecutor said evidence insufficient
- Engström no longer main suspect
- Case remains closed but mystery unsolved

**Did Engström do it?** The 2020 conclusion was criticized as weak. Without a trial, we'll never know.[^8]

## The Conspiracy Theories

### South African Connection

**The theory:**
- Apartheid regime saw Palme as enemy
- South Africa allegedly killed Swedish diplomat to Mozambique (1987)
- Operation Long Reach: Assassinating ANC supporters abroad

**The evidence:**
- Documented South African "dirty tricks"
- Some alleged confessions
- Swedish investigator believed connection possible

**Status:** Credible motive; never proven[^9]

### The PKK (Kurdish Separatists)

**The theory:**
- PKK angry at Sweden's response to Kurdish activism
- Some PKK members arrested; linked to weapons

**The evidence:**
- Investigated extensively
- Some connections to Swedish underworld
- Never proven

**Status:** Investigated; no conviction[^10]

### Rogue Police Elements

**The theory:**
- "Police Trail" (Polspåret)
- Some Swedish police hated Palme (politics)
- Possible involvement of extreme-right officers

**The evidence:**
- Some officers had anti-Palme views
- Investigation into this was controversial
- Never proven

**Status:** Remains discussed[^11]

### The Iran-Contra Connection

**The theory:**
- Palme threatened to expose Swedish arms deals with Iran
- Bofors weapons scandal
- CIA or arms dealers silenced him

**The evidence:**
- Sweden did sell weapons to warring nations
- Scandal emerged after Palme's death
- No direct connection to murder proven

**Status:** Speculative[^12]

### The CIA

**The theory:**
- Palme's criticism of Vietnam made him enemy
- US wanted him gone

**The evidence:**
- Palme was controversial in Washington
- But: No credible evidence of CIA involvement
- US unlikely to assassinate allied leader

**Status:** No evidence[^13]
