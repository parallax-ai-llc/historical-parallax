## Summary

Nils Gustaf Dalén was a Swedish physicist and inventor who won the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of automatic regulators for gas accumulators used in lighting lighthouses and buoys. His Solventil and sun valve automatically turned lighthouse beacons on at dusk and off at dawn, saving gas and lives. He was blinded in an explosion during an experiment but continued his inventive work.
