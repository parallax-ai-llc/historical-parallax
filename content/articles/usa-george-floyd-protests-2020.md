## Summary

On May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer named Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyd's neck for over nine minutes. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill, repeatedly said "I can't breathe" until he stopped breathing at all. A bystander's video captured everything. Within days, America erupted.[^1]

What followed was the largest protest movement in American history. An estimated 15 to 26 million people participated in demonstrations across all 50 states and in countries around the world. "Black Lives Matter"—a phrase born after Trayvon Martin's death in 2012—became a global rallying cry. Police stations burned. Statues fell. For a moment, it seemed like the United States might finally reckon with its history of racist policing.[^2]

The protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, but not entirely. At least 25 people died in protest-related incidents. Police responded with force that often seemed to confirm protesters' accusations: tear gas, rubber bullets, batons, mass arrests. Videos of police brutalizing peaceful demonstrators went viral. The country was having two parallel conversations: one about police violence against Black Americans, and another about it happening in real time.[^3]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did This Moment Explode?

**Factors:**
1. **Video:** Undeniable visual evidence
2. **COVID-19:** People home; economic stress; time to protest
3. **Accumulated cases:** Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor killed earlier in 2020
4. **Duration of killing:** 9+ minutes; deliberate; public
5. **Social media:** Rapid dissemination
6. **Existing infrastructure:** BLM had organized since 2013

### What Changed?

**Public opinion:**
- Support for BLM peaked at ~67% (June 2020)
- Later declined somewhat
- But higher than pre-2020

**Policy:**
- Mixed: Some reforms; resistance to others
- "Defund the police" slogan controversial
- Many cities later increased police budgets

**Culture:**
- Ongoing debates about policing, race
- Some backlash; politicization
- Monuments, naming conversations changed[^10]

### Comparison to Past Movements

| Movement | Era | Scale | Federal Legislation |
|----------|-----|-------|---------------------|
| Civil Rights (1960s) | 1955-1968 | Large | Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act |
| LA Riots | 1992 | One city (primarily) | Limited |
| Ferguson | 2014 | Regional + national | None |
| George Floyd | 2020 | **Largest in history** | Failed to pass major legislation |

**The scale was unprecedented; the policy results were incremental.**[^11]

## Legacy

### For America

- "I can't breathe" in national consciousness
- Debates about police reform ongoing
- Black Lives Matter as mainstream (and contested) phrase
- George Floyd's death a reference point
- Annual commemorations

### For Policing

- Some reforms implemented
- Resistance from police unions
- "Defund" versus "reform" debate
- Ongoing tension in many cities

### The Unfinished Work

**The protests raised questions America has not answered:**
- How to reform policing?
- How to address systemic racism?
- What accountability looks like?
- How to memorialize and move forward?

**The conversation continues.**[^12]
