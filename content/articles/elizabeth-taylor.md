## Summary

Elizabeth Taylor (née Coles; 1912-1975) was an English novelist and short-story writer renowned for her precise use of language and scrupulously understated style.[^1] Despite being described by Kingsley Amis as "one of the best English novelists born in this century," she remained relatively underrated throughout her life.[^2] Her twelve novels and four short story collections explored the nuances of everyday middle-class English life with penetrating psychological insight and subtle wit. She regularly published stories in The New Yorker and maintained close friendships with literary figures including Ivy Compton-Burnett and Robert Liddell.[^3] Her masterpiece, *Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont* (1971), earned a Booker Prize nomination and has been hailed as a triumph of quiet, devastating observation.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Elizabeth Taylor was born Dorothy Betty Coles on July 3, 1912, in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Oliver Coles, an insurance inspector, and his wife Elsie May Fewtrell.[^5] As a child, she was exceptionally close to her mother, who nurtured her imagination and created an early interest in literature.[^6] Oliver had been invalided out of active service in the First World War and worked to support his family, while Elsie devoted herself to full-time motherhood and played a significant role in young Elizabeth's upbringing and literary development.[^7]

In September 1923, Betty attended the Abbey School in Reading, a well-known Christian institution where she excelled academically.[^8] She received 99% on an English paper—the highest mark ever achieved by an Abbey School student at that time.[^9] Betty officially completed her schooling in Berkshire in July 1930, and she wouldn't begin referring to herself as Elizabeth until the early 1930s.[^10]

After finishing her education, Elizabeth worked in various positions that would later inform her fiction. She briefly worked as a governess, then served as a librarian under the auspices of Boots Libraries, first in Maidenhead and then in High Wycombe.[^11] These early experiences observing social interactions and class dynamics in English provincial life would become foundational material for her literary work. In 1936, she married John William Kendall Taylor, a businessman who owned a confectionery company, and the couple settled in Penn, Buckinghamshire, where they would remain for almost all their married life.[^12] Following her marriage, Elizabeth stopped working outside the home and devoted herself to domestic life and writing.

## Rise to Prominence

Elizabeth Taylor's journey to becoming a published novelist began during World War II. Her first published work was a short story titled "For Thine is the Power," which appeared in *Tribune* on March 31, 1944.[^13] The piece was accepted by George Orwell, the magazine's new literary editor, after having been rejected by Reginald Moore at *Modern Reading* the previous year.[^14] This early validation from one of the era's most important literary figures proved significant for Taylor's confidence as a writer.

Her debut novel, *At Mrs. Lippincote's*, was published in 1945 to favorable reviews.[^15] The novel drew on her experiences as a governess and demonstrated her already mature style—characterized by precise observation, psychological acuity, and understated prose. The book established her as a promising new voice in English fiction and was quickly followed by *Palladian* (1946), which showed most clearly the influence of Jane Austen and told the story of a young woman who falls in love with her employer.[^16]

*A View of the Harbour* (1947) marked a further development in her craft, exploring the lives of residents in a faded coastal village with characteristic wit and penetration.[^17] She developed a steady rhythm of production, releasing novels at intervals of one to three years throughout her career. By the early 1950s, with the publication of *A Wreath of Roses* (1949) and *A Game of Hide and Seek* (1951), Taylor had established herself as a significant chronicler of English middle-class life.[^18] 

In 1948, Taylor began what would become a lifelong correspondence with Robert Liddell, a novelist and critic living in Greece.[^19] She wrote to him in autumn of that year, complimenting him on his novel *The Last Enchantments*, and enclosed a copy of her recently published *A View of the Harbour*.[^20] This friendship, conducted largely through letters over more than twenty-five years, provided Taylor with an important literary confidant, though she later insisted that Liddell destroy all her letters to him, consistent with her fierce commitment to privacy.[^21]

## Major Achievements

Elizabeth Taylor's literary career spanned three decades and produced a remarkable body of work consisting of twelve novels, four short story collections, and one children's book. Her novels include *At Mrs. Lippincote's* (1945), *Palladian* (1946), *A View of the Harbour* (1947), *A Wreath of Roses* (1949), *A Game of Hide and Seek* (1951), *The Sleeping Beauty* (1953), *Angel* (1957), *In a Summer Season* (1961), *The Soul of Kindness* (1964), *The Wedding Group* (1968), *Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont* (1971), and *Blaming* (1976, published posthumously).[^22]

Her short story collections—*Hester Lilly and Twelve Short Stories* (1954), *The Blush and Other Stories* (1958), *A Dedicated Man and Other Stories* (1965), and *The Devastating Boys* (1972)—demonstrated her mastery of the shorter form.[^23] Over her career, she wrote 65 short stories in total, many of which appeared in *The New Yorker*, where she published regularly from 1947 onwards, working first with Katharine White and later until 1969 with William Maxwell.[^24] Her stories were posthumously collected in the critically acclaimed *Complete Short Stories* (2012), published by Virago to mark the centenary of her birth.[^25]

Taylor's novel *Angel* (1957) proved particularly distinctive—a satirical portrait of a talentless romantic novelist based on Marie Corelli (1855-1924), a writer of popular fiction in the Victorian era.[^26] While some readers found the protagonist "quite ghastly" (which was indeed Taylor's intention), the novel showcased her range and willingness to experiment.[^27] In 2007, French director François Ozon adapted *Angel* into a film starring Romola Garai, Sam Neill, Michael Fassbender, and Charlotte Rampling.[^28]

*Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont* (1971), widely regarded as her masterpiece, tells the story of an elderly widow who moves into a residential hotel and develops an unlikely friendship with a young aspiring writer.[^29] The novel was shortlisted for the 1971 Booker Prize and later included in Robert McCrum's list of the 100 Best Novels in English.[^30] Paul Bailey described it in 1973 as both her "funniest" and "saddest" book, while Robert McCrum stated: "Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is, for me, her masterpiece."[^31]

In 1967, Taylor published her only children's book, *Mossy Trotter*, about an eight-year-old boy adjusting to life in the country.[^32] Her son Renny later noted that some of the book was based on his own childhood.[^33] Throughout her career, Taylor received consistently good reviews and earned the admiration of fellow writers, even as broader literary fame eluded her.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite the consistently positive critical reception of her work, Elizabeth Taylor never achieved the widespread recognition that many believed she deserved. Taylor "never earned a literary reputation that would reflect the generally good reviews of her work," with Kingsley Amis attributing her lack of recognition to her concentration on domestic life.[^34] Some critics labeled her works as "women's novels" that were "frequently vilified" by the literary establishment.[^35]

In the "Angry Decade" of the 1950s and the socially and politically conscious 1960s, when the prevailing fashion in fiction emphasized "size, scope, relevance and Importance," Taylor's work was too often condescended to as high-class "women's novels."[^36] She was part of a generation of "women writers" working in post-First World War Britain whose reputations remained trapped within the prison of "domestic romance," and most were overshadowed by a younger generation of Angry Young Men who dominated the literary scene.[^37]

Critics also noted that Taylor "must be the last serious English novelist with a consistent interest in domestic servants"—an interest that seemed to confirm her as hopelessly backward-looking to some contemporary readers.[^38] Her avowed aversion to adventure, coupled with a horror of publicity, further contributed to her being underrated.[^39] A somewhat flippant, though not entirely untrue, explanation for her inexplicable lack of renown has been her name—bearing the same name as one of Hollywood's most recognizable icons inevitably caused confusion and overshadowing.[^40]

Taylor did demonstrate political awareness in some instances. After the "Colonels' Revolution" in Greece in 1967, she refused to visit the country under their regime, and she was later "blacklisted" because she "said something disobliging in an interview" about this government.[^41] However, her fiction remained resolutely focused on personal relationships and domestic life rather than overtly political themes.

The critical dismissal of her work as mere "domestic fiction" revealed more about the biases of mid-twentieth-century literary culture than about the quality of her writing. Her shrewd but affectionate portrayals of middle-class and upper-middle-class English life won her an audience of discriminating readers and loyal friends in the world of letters, even if the broader literary establishment failed to canonize her during her lifetime.[^42]

---

## Personal Life

Elizabeth Taylor married John William Kendall Taylor in 1936, and the couple had two children: a son, Renny (born 1937), and a daughter, Joanna (born 1941).[^43] The family lived in Penn, Buckinghamshire, for almost all their married life, where Elizabeth balanced her domestic responsibilities with her writing career.[^44]

Taylor was notoriously private and refused to reveal anything about her personal life, even to such close friends as Ivy Compton-Burnett and Robert Liddell.[^45] This commitment to privacy extended to her literary correspondence—she insisted that Liddell destroy all the letters she had written to him, maintaining her general policy of keeping her private life strictly private.[^46] Her horror of publicity became the subject of a celebrated short story, "Sisters," written in 1969.[^47]

Her reticence was evident in interviews. When novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard met Taylor as part of the publicity for *In a Summer Season* (1961), Howard had prepared thirty questions for an eight-minute interview, anticipating that would be more than sufficient.[^48] However, Elizabeth so quickly dispatched those queries with 'yes' and 'no' answers that Howard's questions were exhausted in under two minutes.[^49]

Taylor maintained a disciplined writing routine, making time to write in the afternoons "with lunch tidied away and Woman's Hour over."[^50] She explained her process: "I write in scenes, rather than in narrative, which I find boring. I am pleased if the look of a page is interesting, broken by paragraphs or dialogue, not just one dense slab of print."[^51] She described her philosophy to her American publisher: "People are my only adventures and I hope never to have any others … to be 'ordinary' and live among 'ordinary' people (though no one is really that) is the only way that I can write."[^52]

Taylor cultivated important literary friendships despite her privacy. She became a good friend of Ivy Compton-Burnett in the 1950s, and the two writers greatly admired each other's work, though Ivy commented that Taylor was "a young woman who looks as if she never had to wash her own gloves."[^53] Taylor's friendship with Compton-Burnett was one of two inspirations for *Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont*.[^54] She also visited Robert Liddell in Greece five or six times, mostly in the 1960s and '70s, maintaining their correspondence until within a month of her death.[^55]

Elizabeth Taylor died of cancer on November 19, 1975, in Penn, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 63.[^56] Her final novel, *Blaming*, which she worked on until she died, was published posthumously by her husband in 1976.[^57]

## Legacy

Elizabeth Taylor's literary legacy has experienced a remarkable posthumous revival, transforming her from an underrated writer to one increasingly recognized as among the best British novelists of the twentieth century.[^58] Her work has been championed by major publishers including Virago Modern Classics and New York Review Books, which have reissued her novels with new introductions by distinguished writers.[^59]

Virago has been particularly instrumental in reviving Taylor's reputation, reissuing six of her novels with introductions by writers such as Hilary Mantel and Jonathan Keates, all of whom extol her work and bemoan her neglect.[^60] The publication of her *Complete Short Stories* in 2012 marked the centenary of her birth and included stories previously only published in *The New Yorker*, bringing renewed attention to what many consider her central achievement.[^61]

Taylor's literary influences included Virginia Woolf, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and E.M. Forster.[^62] Anne Tyler compared Taylor to Jane Austen, Barbara Pym, and Elizabeth Bowen—"soul sisters all," in Tyler's words.[^63] In a 2012 *Guardian* article, both Paul Bailey and Elizabeth Jane Howard declared themselves envious of "any reader coming to her for the first time."[^64]

Behind the façade of quiet middle-class domesticity which characterized her public persona, one finds a keen observer of human foibles whose work reveals domesticity as a primary arena for quiet tragedy and muted comedy.[^65] Her novels portray marriages and child-rearing not as idyllic havens but as structures enforcing constraint through everyday tedium.[^66] One of her central themes is "the theme of transition between two worlds"—the genteel, complacent, and secure pre-1945 era that had been obliterated during the war, and the modern world shaken by social conflicts and economic austerity.[^67]

Taylor's work has been compared to that of Jane Austen for its wit, precision, and social observation. Her eye was as sharply all-seeing as her prose was elegant, and her novels are witty, savage, and full of loneliness.[^68] Her characters wield their propriety like armour, while her writing subverts domestic routine with sly humour and careful observation.[^69] Brigid Brophy noted Elizabeth Taylor's uncanny capacity to encapsulate everyday details, while literary reviewers consistently commented on her ability to sketch scenes on the page.[^70]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Kingsley Amis provided perhaps the most succinct praise, describing Taylor as "one of the best English novelists born in this century."[^71] Antonia Fraser called her "one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century," while Hilary Mantel described her as "deft, accomplished and somewhat underrated."[^72] These assessments from distinguished writers reflect a consensus among literary insiders about Taylor's exceptional talent.

Robert McCrum's inclusion of *Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont* in his list of the 100 Best Novels in English represents a significant recognition of her achievement.[^73] The novel's Booker Prize nomination in 1971 similarly acknowledged her standing among the era's finest writers.[^74] Critics have particularly praised her precise use of language, her scrupulously understated style, and her ability to reveal profound truths through seemingly mundane domestic situations.[^75]

Scholarly reassessment has emphasized how Taylor's work, mainly concerned with the nuances of everyday life and situations, achieved remarkable depth and complexity.[^76] Her shrewd but affectionate portrayals won her an audience of discriminating readers and established her as a significant chronicler of English middle-class life.[^77] The sustained efforts by Virago and New York Review Books to keep her work in print demonstrate ongoing recognition of her literary significance.[^78]

Contemporary writers have been particularly enthusiastic in their praise. In addition to Anne Tyler's comparison to Jane Austen, Barbara Pym, and Elizabeth Bowen, numerous novelists have acknowledged Taylor's influence on their own work.[^79] The 2012 Guardian article featuring testimonials from Paul Bailey and Elizabeth Jane Howard exemplifies the enduring admiration Taylor commands among fellow writers.[^80]

### Negative Views

The primary criticism of Taylor's work during her lifetime centered on its perceived limitations as "domestic fiction" or "women's novels."[^81] In an era when literary prestige was associated with "size, scope, relevance and Importance," Taylor's focused explorations of middle-class English domestic life were often condescended to by critics seeking grander themes.[^82] This dismissal reflected the gender bias prevalent in mid-twentieth-century literary culture, which devalued fiction focused on women's experiences and domestic spaces.

Some readers found her novel *Angel* problematic, with the protagonist considered "quite ghastly" and the book criticized as "too wordy, too slow" with no warmable characters.[^83] However, defenders argued this was precisely Taylor's intention—to create an unsympathetic portrait of a deluded romantic novelist. The critical reception of *Angel* highlighted tensions in how readers approached Taylor's more experimental and satirical works.

Taylor's consistent interest in domestic servants struck some modern critics as hopelessly backward-looking, suggesting she was "the last serious English novelist" to treat this subject seriously.[^84] This criticism positioned her as clinging to pre-war social structures even as British society was rapidly changing. Her focus on the genteel world of the middle and upper-middle classes seemed increasingly anachronistic to critics invested in the social realism of the Angry Young Men.

The oversight of Taylor by the broader literary establishment, despite consistently good reviews, suggests that institutional biases worked against her canonization.[^85] Although critics and writers who read her nearly universally praised her work, efforts on behalf of Taylor's reputation "failed to budge whoever or whatever is in charge of canonizing authors."[^86] This failure reflects less on the quality of her writing than on the mechanisms of literary reputation-making, which historically have favored male writers and marginalized fiction focused on domestic and feminine experience.
