## Summary

Hadewijch was a 13th-century Flemish mystic and one of the most important female writers of the Middle Ages. She lived as a Beguine and wrote visionary prose, letters, and poetry exploring the nature of divine love (Minne). Her strophic poems are among the earliest lyrics in Dutch literature and rank among the finest mystical poetry in any language. Her concept of the 'abyss' of love anticipated Meister Eckhart's mystical theology.
