## Summary

Konstantin Novoselov is a Russian-born British physicist who shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics with Andre Geim for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene. Using sticky tape, they isolated graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms — from graphite in 2004. This deceptively simple technique opened a new field of materials science.
