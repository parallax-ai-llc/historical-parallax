## Summary

Ueshiba Morihei founded aikido by applying principles of physics — circular motion, redirection of force, and center of gravity manipulation — to martial arts. His systematic analysis of how bodies interact through forces and momentum created a martial art based on scientific principles of biomechanics rather than brute strength.
