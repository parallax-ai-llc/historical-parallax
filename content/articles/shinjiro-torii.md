## Summary

Shinjiro Torii founded Suntory in 1899 and created Japan's whisky industry. He opened Japan's first whisky distillery at Yamazaki in 1923, bringing Scotch whisky production techniques to Japan. Despite initial commercial failure, his persistence established Japanese whisky as a world-class spirit. His famous motto was 'Yatte minahare' ('Go for it'), which became Suntory's corporate philosophy.
