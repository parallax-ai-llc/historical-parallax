## Summary

Erich Georg Sebastian Anton von Falkenhayn was a German general and Ottoman Field Marshal who served as Chief of the German General Staff during the First World War from September 1914 to August 1916.[^1] He is best known for his controversial strategy at the Battle of Verdun in 1916, where he sought to "bleed France white" through attrition warfare, resulting in over 700,000 combined casualties.[^2] After his removal from supreme command following the failure at Verdun, he successfully commanded German forces in the Romanian campaign and later served in the Ottoman Empire, where he prevented the planned deportation of Jews from Palestine.[^3] His legacy remains debated among historians, with modern scholarship increasingly challenging the negative assessments that dominated post-war narratives.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Erich von Falkenhayn was born on September 11, 1861, at Burg Belchau, a village near Graudenz in West Prussia (now Białochowo in Poland, near Grudziądz).[^5] He came from an aristocratic West Prussian Junker family with deep military traditions.[^6] His father, Fedor von Falkenhayn (1814-1896), and mother, Franziska von Falkenhayn née von Rosenberg (1826-1888), raised him in an environment where military service was considered the highest calling for men of their class.[^7]

The Falkenhayn family was extensively connected to Prussia's military elite. His brother Arthur (1857-1929) became tutor to Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, while another brother, Eugen (1853-1934), rose to the rank of Prussian General of Cavalry.[^8] His only sister, Olga von Falkenhayn, married into military aristocracy and became the mother of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, who would later gain prominence during World War II.[^9]

Falkenhayn's military education began early when he entered cadet school at the age of ten, following the traditional path for boys of his social class.[^10] He graduated from a military academy in 1880, beginning his career as a junior officer in the Prussian Army.[^11] His intellectual abilities were evident when he attended the prestigious Kriegsakademie (War Academy), graduating in 1890 and ranking third in his class.[^12] This high ranking facilitated his entry into the elite Great General Staff as a captain in 1893, marking him as an officer of exceptional promise.[^13]

His early career progression followed the standard pattern for talented General Staff officers. He became First Lieutenant in 1889 and Hauptmann (captain) in 1893, subsequently transferring to the topographical department of the German General Staff.[^14] However, his career would soon take an unusual and career-defining turn that would bring him to the attention of Kaiser Wilhelm II himself.

## Rise to Power

Falkenhayn's rise to prominence took an unconventional path that distinguished him from most Prussian General Staff officers. In 1896, he made the unusual decision to take leave from the General Staff and travel to China to serve as a military instructor to the Chinese army.[^15] This posting in Asia, far from the traditional centers of Prussian military power, paradoxically became the foundation of his future influence.

His time in China coincided with the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, a violent anti-foreign uprising that threatened Western interests and nationals in China. Falkenhayn saw active combat as a general staff officer serving under Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee during the international expedition to suppress the Boxers.[^16] He also spent time in Manchuria and Korea, gaining experience in Asian military affairs that few German officers possessed.[^17] Crucially, Falkenhayn maintained correspondence with Kaiser Wilhelm II during this period, sending detailed reports on the conflict and discussing military tactics.[^18] These communications earned him the Kaiser's trust and respect, making him a favorite of the monarch.[^19]

Upon returning to Germany, Falkenhayn's connections to the imperial court proved invaluable. He became one of the military instructors of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, further cementing his position in the Kaiser's inner circle.[^20] This patronage accelerated his career advancement in ways that pure military merit alone might not have achieved. He was known as a young, ambitious leader with excellent connections to Kaiser Wilhelm II, which distinguished him from many more senior but less politically connected officers.[^21]

The culmination of Falkenhayn's pre-war rise came on July 8, 1913, when he was appointed Prussian Minister of War, succeeding Josias von Heeringen.[^22] This was an extraordinarily powerful position, making him responsible for the armament and equipment of the entire German army.[^23] From July 1913 to January 1915, he held this crucial post, during which he greatly improved the system of munitions supply and the transportation of troops by rail—reforms that would prove critical when war came.[^24]

When World War I began in August 1914, Falkenhayn was positioned to play a major role. After the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the German defeat at the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm II needed a new supreme commander.[^25] At the request of the military cabinet, Falkenhayn declared himself ready to succeed the discredited Helmuth von Moltke the Younger as Chief of the General Staff.[^26] On September 14, 1914, he was formally appointed to this supreme command position, making him the most powerful military figure in Germany and one of the most important individuals in the Central Powers' war effort.[^27] He had been endorsed as a candidate by both the emperor and the Military Cabinet, though this political mode of selection would later contribute to questions about his legitimacy among rival generals.[^28]

## Major Achievements

Falkenhayn's tenure as Chief of the German General Staff was marked by several significant military accomplishments, though they would be overshadowed in popular memory by his failures. His strategic thinking demonstrated an unusual realism about Germany's long-term prospects in the war that distinguished him from more optimistic commanders.

### Stabilization of the Western Front (1914-1915)

After assuming command in September 1914, Falkenhayn's immediate challenge was to stabilize the situation following the disaster at the Marne. He successfully managed this crisis, preventing a complete German collapse and establishing the trench warfare system that would characterize the Western Front for the next four years.[^29] Unlike many of his peers, Falkenhayn demonstrated strategic realism early in the war. In November 1914, he acknowledged to Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg that Germany would not be able to gain a decisive victory and advocated for a mild peace with the Russian Empire to better concentrate against France and Britain.[^30] This clear-eyed assessment of Germany's strategic position was remarkable at a time when most German leaders still believed in rapid victory.

### Eastern Front Operations (1915)

In the spring of 1915, Falkenhayn planned diversionary attacks on the Eastern Front to support the Austrians against the Russians and to discourage Italy from entering the war.[^31] The most successful of these was the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive, which caused the Russians to evacuate Russian Poland and retreat deeper into their territory.[^32] While Falkenhayn's critics, particularly Hindenburg and Ludendorff, wanted a more ambitious campaign aimed at completely destroying the Russian army, Falkenhayn's more limited objectives proved strategically sound given Germany's resource constraints.[^33] He argued that the Western Front should not be unduly weakened and that the Russians could always retreat into the vastness of their territory, making total operational victory virtually impossible.[^34]

### The Romanian Campaign (1916-1917)

Falkenhayn's greatest military triumph came after his removal as Chief of the General Staff. Assigned command of the 9th Army in Transylvania on September 6, 1916, he launched a highly successful campaign against Romania in coordination with Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who attacked from Bulgaria through the Dobruja.[^35] The campaign was a masterpiece of mobile warfare that foreshadowed later German operational concepts. Falkenhayn's offensive crushed three Romanian armies, destroyed 17 of the 23 infantry divisions available to Romania, and covered over 580 kilometers in a rapid advance.[^36] Linking up with Mackensen's forces in mid-November, Falkenhayn's troops entered Bucharest on December 6, 1916, thereby defeating Romania and securing vital resources for the Central Powers.[^37]

The Romanian campaign was so effective that military historian Michael B. Barrett considers it a precursor to the Blitzkrieg tactics of World War II, demonstrating Falkenhayn's capabilities when freed from the constraints of coalition warfare and political interference.[^38] The victorious campaign greatly strengthened the morale of German troops and their generals, essentially redeeming Falkenhayn's military reputation after his earlier setbacks at Verdun.[^39]

### Service in the Ottoman Empire (1917-1918)

Following his success in Romania, Falkenhayn was appointed supreme commander of two Ottoman armies in Palestine, receiving the rank of Mushir (Field Marshal) of the Ottoman Army.[^40] Though he was not successful in the Palestine campaign and was defeated by British troops led by General Edmund Allenby in October 1917,[^41] Falkenhayn's service in the Middle East included one of the most morally significant acts of his career. He prevented a planned Ottoman deportation and massacre of the Jewish population of Palestine that Governor Djemal Pasha had intended to carry out along the lines of the Armenian genocide.[^42]

When Falkenhayn arrived in Palestine in 1917, Djemal Pasha sought to expel the Jews of Jerusalem and surrounding areas, with expulsions from Jaffa and Tel Aviv having already occurred in late 1914 and early 1917.[^43] Djemal was one of the "Young Turk" leaders accused of orchestrating the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenians.[^44] Falkenhayn argued forcefully against these plans and used his authority as supreme commander to block them.[^45] According to his biographer, "An inhuman excess against the Jews in Palestine was prevented only by Falkenhayn's conduct"—a statement with special significance given Germany's later history in the 20th century.[^46]

### Administrative and Organizational Reforms

As Prussian Minister of War from 1913 to 1915, Falkenhayn implemented crucial reforms that prepared Germany for modern industrial warfare. He greatly improved the munitions supply system and the transportation of troops by rail, creating logistical capabilities that enabled Germany to sustain a two-front war for four years.[^47] These administrative achievements, though less dramatic than battlefield victories, were essential to Germany's ability to continue fighting despite being outnumbered and blockaded.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Falkenhayn's military career was marked by intense controversies and harsh criticisms, particularly regarding his strategic decisions and his relationships with other German commanders. These controversies would damage his reputation both during and after the war.

### The Battle of Verdun (1916)

The most devastating criticism of Falkenhayn centers on his conception and execution of the Battle of Verdun, which began on February 21, 1916.[^48] Falkenhayn believed that the war would be won or lost in France and developed a strategy of attrition as Germany's best hope of achieving its goals.[^49] He planned to seize or threaten the ancient fortress city of Verdun, a place where strategic necessity and French national pride combined, forcing France to commit all its reserves to defend it.[^50]

The tactical plan involved using more than 1,200 artillery pieces to destroy French units while making limited use of German infantry to minimize German casualties.[^51] Falkenhayn's stated goal was to "bleed France white"—a phrase that became synonymous with his strategy and later haunted his reputation.[^52] However, the plan failed catastrophically. Crown Prince Wilhelm and his staff stopped following Falkenhayn's strategic concept and committed the Fifth Army to greater offensive action, making the seizure of ground the priority rather than inflicting casualties at minimal cost.[^53] By the end of February, German losses at Verdun were similar to French casualties.[^54]

The battle raged for ten months, resulting in over 700,000 combined casualties, including some 300,000 killed.[^55] German casualties amounted to approximately 337,000, with around 143,000 dead.[^56] The losses suffered by the two sides were almost identical, completely undermining Falkenhayn's strategy of disproportionate attrition.[^57] He had overestimated Germany's ability to inflict one-sided losses; instead, his men found themselves in a battle of attrition that wore them down as much as the French.[^58] The scale of German losses brought Falkenhayn enormous criticism from within the German military and political establishment.[^59]

### Strategic Disputes with Hindenburg and Ludendorff

Falkenhayn engaged in bitter strategic disagreements with Generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff about where to concentrate German military efforts.[^60] The eastern commanders believed Germany should focus on defeating Russia decisively, while Falkenhayn maintained that the war would be won in the west and concentrated available forces against France and Britain.[^61] 

As a strategist, Falkenhayn was considered cautious and risk-averse. He refused to support Ludendorff's bold plan for the Eastern Front that might have trapped and destroyed the Russian army, instead supporting a more conservative approach.[^62] In the 1915 Eastern Front campaign, he dismissed Ludendorff's plan as too bold, claiming it left him feeling uneasy.[^63] Critics argued that this caution cost Germany the opportunity for a decisive victory in the east that could have knocked Russia out of the war early.

### Removal from Command

The cumulative effect of these failures led to Falkenhayn's dismissal. He was removed on August 29, 1916, following the failure of his offensive strategy at Verdun, the opening of the Battle of the Somme, the Brusilov Offensive, and Romania's entry into the war.[^64] Kaiser Wilhelm II finally decided to replace Falkenhayn with Hindenburg when he heard news of Romania's declaration of war against Austria-Hungary.[^65] The failure to capture Verdun was the decisive factor in Falkenhayn's removal as Chief of Staff and Paul von Hindenburg's installation, along with Erich Ludendorff as Hindenburg's deputy.[^66]

### Contemporary Military Criticism

Military theorist Sir Basil Liddell Hart, one of the most influential military thinkers of the interwar period, offered a harsh assessment of Falkenhayn. He wrote that Falkenhayn's "actions and his mental attitude were those of a commander striving to ward off impending defeat" and that "He erred on the side of pessimism."[^67] Liddell Hart's critique suggested that Falkenhayn lacked the offensive spirit and confidence necessary for successful high command.

### Political Attacks and Historical Blame

After World War I, German official historians laid much of the blame for the army's defeat on Falkenhayn.[^68] His reputation as a war leader was systematically attacked in Germany during and after the war, especially by the faction supporting Field Marshal Hindenburg.[^69] This political campaign to scapegoat Falkenhayn served the interests of those who wished to deflect responsibility for Germany's defeat onto a convenient target who lacked the political support to defend himself effectively.

### Relationship Tensions with the Kaiser

Despite his initial favor with Kaiser Wilhelm II, Falkenhayn's relationship with the monarch deteriorated during the war. During the July Crisis of 1914, Falkenhayn noted in his diary after a discussion with the Kaiser: "He makes confused speeches. The only thing that emerges clearly is that he no longer wants war, even if it means letting Austria down. I point out that he no longer has control over the situation."[^70] This private assessment reveals Falkenhayn's growing frustration with imperial indecision. His responsibility increased when the Kaiser failed to provide clear strategic direction, leaving Falkenhayn to navigate Germany's war effort amid political and military crosscurrents.[^71]

### Opposition to Unofficial Truces

Falkenhayn's rigid enforcement of military discipline sometimes put him at odds with the human impulses of frontline soldiers. As Chief of the German General Staff, he expressly forbade the Christmas Truce of 1914 and promised punishments for those who attempted to arrange truces with the enemy.[^72] Despite his orders and threats, the holiday spirit of men in the trenches proved stronger than his directives, with spontaneous ceasefires occurring along various parts of the Western Front.[^73] This incident demonstrated the limitations of top-down military authority when it conflicted with soldiers' basic humanity.

## Personal Life

Erich von Falkenhayn's personal life reflected both the conventions and contradictions of Prussian military aristocracy at the turn of the 20th century. On February 3, 1886, in Oldenburg, Germany, the 24-year-old Falkenhayn married Maria Flora Karoline Ida Selkmann, who was born on June 7, 1866.[^74] The marriage was notable because Selkmann came from a non-noble background, which was atypical for a Prussian officer of Falkenhayn's Junker heritage and social standing.[^75] This choice of bride suggests that Falkenhayn possessed a degree of independence from rigid class conventions, at least in his personal life.

The couple had two children who would lead dramatically different lives in the turbulent 20th century. Their son, Fritz Georg Adalbert von Falkenhayn, was born in 1890 and lived until 1973, surviving both world wars and the division of Germany.[^76] Little is documented about Fritz's public life or career, suggesting he chose to live outside the spotlight that had surrounded his father.[^77]

Their daughter, Erika Katharina Olga Luise Helene Florence von Falkenhayn, was born in 1904 and lived until 1974.[^78] Erika's life intersected dramatically with German history when she married Generalmajor Henning von Tresckow, a key figure in the July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.[^79] This connection placed Falkenhayn's family at the center of German resistance to Nazism, creating an ironic historical legacy given his earlier service to the German Empire.

Beyond these family details, Falkenhayn's personality emerges most clearly through assessments of his character as a military superior and colleague. All contemporary sources portray him as a loyal, honest, and punctilious friend and superior.[^80] These qualities suggest a man who valued proper conduct and personal integrity, even amid the moral compromises inherent in high military command. His memoirs, published in 1919 as "The German General Staff and Its Critical Decisions, 1914-1916," reveal something of his character as well.[^81] One reviewer noted that "The attentive reader of his book will be impressed with General von Falkenhayn's personality. He writes like a soldier, not like a politician."[^82] This assessment suggests a direct, professional approach to military matters, focused on operational and strategic questions rather than political maneuvering or self-justification.

After the war, Falkenhayn demonstrated intellectual engagement with the conflict he had helped to wage. With the benefit of hindsight, he remarked in his writings that the German declarations of war on Russia and France in 1914 were "justifiable but overly-hasty and unnecessary."[^83] This reflection shows a capacity for self-criticism and historical perspective that not all defeated generals possessed. His final years were spent at his estate near Potsdam, where he retired from the army in 1919 and devoted himself to writing his autobiography and several books on war and strategy.[^84]

Falkenhayn's final military assignment before retirement was command of the German Tenth Army in Lithuania (March 5, 1918), which by that point was no longer a combat command.[^85] He died on April 8, 1922, at Schloss Lindstedt near Potsdam and was buried in Potsdam.[^86] He lived long enough to see Germany's defeat, the collapse of the monarchy he had served, and the bitter recriminations of the post-war period, but he did not witness the rise of Nazism or the Second World War that would once again devastate Europe.

## Legacy

Erich von Falkenhayn's legacy has been profoundly contested, evolving significantly over the century since his death. His reputation suffered tremendously in the immediate aftermath of World War I, but modern scholarship has increasingly challenged these negative assessments, revealing a more complex and capable figure than traditional narratives suggested.

### Immediate Post-War Condemnation

In the years immediately following Germany's defeat in 1918, Falkenhayn became a convenient scapegoat for the catastrophe that had befallen the German Empire. German official historians laid much of the blame for the army's defeat on him, focusing particularly on his failed strategy at Verdun and his conflicts with the more popular Hindenburg-Ludendorff partnership.[^87] His reputation as a war leader was systematically attacked, especially by the faction supporting Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who sought to minimize their own responsibility for Germany's ultimate defeat by highlighting Falkenhayn's earlier failures.[^88]

This political campaign against Falkenhayn's reputation proved remarkably successful. For decades, he was portrayed as an overly cautious, pessimistic commander who lacked the boldness necessary for victory and whose attrition strategy at Verdun had needlessly sacrificed hundreds of thousands of German lives without achieving meaningful strategic results.[^89] The phrase "bleed them white," associated with his Verdun strategy, became a symbol of military callousness and strategic bankruptcy.

### Modern Scholarly Reassessment

Beginning in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, military historians undertook a substantial reassessment of Falkenhayn's tenure as Chief of the General Staff. These revisionist scholars have challenged many of the charges that were leveled against him by his contemporaries and immediate successors.

Markus Pöhlmann's exhaustive analysis of the German official history laid bare the political motivations behind the charges against Falkenhayn, demonstrating that they were grounded more in post-war factional disputes than in objective military analysis.[^90] Holger Afflerbach's biography of Falkenhayn demonstrated that most of the specific charges against him were baseless or greatly exaggerated.[^91] Robert T. Foley's study, "German Strategy and the Path to Verdun: Erich von Falkenhayn and the Development of Attrition, 1870-1916," offers perhaps the most far-reaching defense of Falkenhayn to date.[^92] Foley demonstrates that despite Verdun, Falkenhayn was chiefly responsible for most of Germany's victories during his tenure in command, managing a complex coalition war under extraordinarily difficult strategic circumstances.[^93]

### Strategic Vision and Military Thought

Modern scholars have particularly revised understanding of Falkenhayn's strategic thinking. Rather than viewing his realism about Germany's prospects as defeatist pessimism, historians now recognize it as an accurate assessment of Germany's strategic position in a coalition war against superior forces.[^94] Foley situates Falkenhayn's command decisions within a tradition of German military thinking that took shape in the late 19th century in opposition to the army's fixation on strategic maneuver, battles of annihilation, and short, decisive wars.[^95]

Falkenhayn held the belief that Germany could not win the war by a decisive battle but would have to reach a compromise peace—a view his enemies said demonstrated he lacked the resolve necessary to win a decisive victory.[^96] However, this assessment proved largely correct. The Hindenburg-Ludendorff team that replaced him pursued exactly the kind of aggressive, all-or-nothing strategy Falkenhayn had warned against, ultimately leading to Germany's complete collapse in 1918 rather than a negotiated settlement that might have preserved some German interests.

### Operational Successes and Comparative Assessment

The Romanian campaign of 1916-1917 stands as powerful evidence for the revisionist view of Falkenhayn's capabilities. When given clear operational objectives and freed from the constraints of coalition politics and strategic indecision at the highest levels of German leadership, Falkenhayn demonstrated exceptional skill in mobile warfare and operational planning.[^97] The campaign's effectiveness has led historians like Michael B. Barrett to consider it a precursor to World War II's Blitzkrieg tactics.[^98]

### Moral Legacy

Perhaps Falkenhayn's most unambiguous positive legacy concerns his conduct in Palestine in 1917, where he prevented the planned Ottoman deportation of Jews that Governor Djemal Pasha had intended along the lines of the Armenian genocide.[^99] This intervention, which his biographer credited with preventing "an inhuman excess against the Jews in Palestine," carries particular moral weight given Germany's later crimes against European Jewry.[^100] It demonstrates that even within the often morally compromised world of high military command, individual choices could have profound humanitarian consequences.

### Enduring Controversies

Despite scholarly rehabilitation, Falkenhayn's legacy remains controversial. The Battle of Verdun—with its staggering casualties and ultimate failure to achieve strategic objectives—cannot be entirely excused or explained away, even by sympathetic historians. The question of whether a more aggressive Eastern Front strategy in 1915, as advocated by Ludendorff, might have knocked Russia out of the war earlier remains a matter of debate among military historians.[^101]

### Comparative Standing Among WWI Commanders

In the pantheon of World War I military leaders, Falkenhayn occupies a middle position. He lacked the political skills and public relations savvy that made Hindenburg a national icon. He lacked the operational brilliance and aggressive instincts of commanders like Ludendorff or France's Ferdinand Foch. However, modern assessment suggests he possessed a clearer understanding of Germany's strategic limitations than most of his contemporaries and managed an extraordinarily difficult coalition war with reasonable competence under nearly impossible circumstances.[^102]

His legacy illustrates how military reputations are shaped as much by political factors, personal rivalries, and post-war narratives as by actual battlefield performance. The substantial revision of his historical standing over the past several decades demonstrates that historical judgments, even about events as thoroughly documented as World War I, remain subject to reinterpretation as new evidence emerges and new analytical frameworks are applied to familiar material.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has increasingly offered more favorable assessments of Erich von Falkenhayn's military leadership, challenging the negative narrative that dominated for decades after World War I. Robert T. Foley's comprehensive study represents the most systematic defense of Falkenhayn's strategic thinking and operational decisions.[^103] Foley argues that Falkenhayn demonstrated remarkable strategic realism in recognizing that Germany could not achieve total victory against the Allied coalition and that a strategy of attrition, however unpalatable, offered the best path to a negotiated settlement that would preserve German interests.[^104]

Holger Afflerbach's biography demonstrates that many specific charges leveled against Falkenhayn by his critics were either baseless or greatly exaggerated, often motivated by post-war political considerations rather than objective military analysis.[^105] Afflerbach portrays Falkenhayn as a capable strategist operating under extraordinarily difficult constraints, including an indecisive Kaiser, limited resources, unreliable coalition partners in Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, and ambitious rivals who undermined his authority.[^106]

Scholars have particularly praised Falkenhayn's administrative and organizational capabilities. His reforms as Prussian Minister of War from 1913 to 1915, which greatly improved Germany's munitions supply system and troop transportation by rail, were essential to Germany's ability to sustain a multi-year, multi-front war despite being outnumbered and blockaded.[^107] These achievements, though less dramatic than battlefield victories, demonstrated exceptional organizational skill and foresight about the nature of modern industrial warfare.

The Romanian campaign of 1916-1917 has been cited as evidence of Falkenhayn's operational brilliance when freed from political constraints. Military historian Michael B. Barrett's assessment that the campaign can be considered a precursor to World War II Blitzkrieg tactics represents high praise for Falkenhayn's understanding of mobile warfare and combined arms operations.[^108] The campaign's rapid success, achieved with minimal casualties while destroying the bulk of the Romanian army, stands in stark contrast to the grinding attrition of Verdun.

Falkenhayn's strategic vision regarding the Eastern Front has also been partially rehabilitated. While critics condemned his refusal to pursue Ludendorff's ambitious plans for a decisive victory over Russia, modern analysts have noted that Falkenhayn's concerns about overextension were well-founded.[^109] The vast spaces of Russia did indeed allow the Russian army to retreat rather than face decisive destruction, and Falkenhayn's insistence on maintaining sufficient strength in the West proved prescient given the Allied offensives of 1916.[^110]

His moral courage in preventing the Ottoman deportation of Jews from Palestine in 1917 represents an unambiguous positive achievement. Scholars have emphasized the significance of this intervention, particularly given the later trajectory of German history.[^111] It demonstrates that Falkenhayn, whatever his strategic failings, possessed a moral compass that led him to resist genocidal policies even when doing so created friction with his Ottoman allies.

Contemporary sources that knew Falkenhayn personally consistently describe him as loyal, honest, and punctilious—qualities that suggest personal integrity even if his strategic decisions proved flawed.[^112] His willingness to acknowledge in his post-war writings that Germany's declarations of war in 1914 were "overly-hasty and unnecessary" demonstrates an intellectual honesty and capacity for self-criticism that many defeated generals lacked.[^113]

### Negative Views

Despite revisionist scholarship, substantial criticism of Falkenhayn's military leadership persists, grounded in both his specific decisions and their catastrophic consequences. The Battle of Verdun remains the central and most damning indictment of his generalship. Critics emphasize that Falkenhayn's strategy of attrition failed comprehensively, producing roughly equal casualties on both sides rather than the disproportionate French losses he had predicted.[^114] The battle consumed over 700,000 casualties over ten months without achieving any meaningful strategic objective, and it led directly to Falkenhayn's dismissal in August 1916.[^115]

Military theorist Sir Basil Liddell Hart's assessment that Falkenhayn's "actions and his mental attitude were those of a commander striving to ward off impending defeat" rather than seeking victory has remained influential.[^116] This critique suggests that Falkenhayn's strategic realism, which modern scholars sometimes praise, was actually a form of defeatism that became self-fulfilling. A supreme commander who does not believe in the possibility of victory, critics argue, is unlikely to achieve it.

The strategic dispute with Hindenburg and Ludendorff over Eastern Front strategy continues to generate criticism. While modern scholars note that Falkenhayn's caution had merit, critics argue that the opportunity to knock Russia out of the war in 1915 was real and that Falkenhayn's refusal to pursue Ludendorff's bold operational concepts cost Germany its best chance for victory.[^117] Had Russia been decisively defeated in 1915, Germany could have concentrated its full strength against France and Britain in 1916, potentially achieving the breakthrough that eluded it throughout the war.

Falkenhayn's relationship with his subordinates and peers has been criticized as politically inept. His dependence on the Kaiser's favor rather than building broad support within the officer corps left him vulnerable when his strategies failed.[^118] The bitter factional disputes between Falkenhayn and the Hindenburg-Ludendorff partnership damaged German strategic coherence and unity of command at a critical period of the war.[^119]

His defeat in Palestine by General Allenby in October 1917 demonstrates that Falkenhayn's later commands were not uniformly successful, even if the Romanian campaign had been brilliant.[^120] Critics note that a truly first-rate commander should have been able to achieve better results even with the limited forces available in the Ottoman theater.

Some historians have questioned whether Falkenhayn's strategic concept for Verdun was even coherent. The ambiguity about whether the goal was to capture Verdun or merely to inflict casualties by threatening it suggests unclear strategic thinking.[^121] When Crown Prince Wilhelm and his staff shifted to prioritizing territorial gains, Falkenhayn apparently failed to effectively reassert control over the operation's objectives, allowing it to devolve into exactly the kind of mutual bloodbath he had supposedly wanted to avoid.[^122]

The contemporary criticism Falkenhayn received from German sources cannot be entirely dismissed as political scapegoating. Many professional German officers who worked with him genuinely questioned his strategic judgment and operational concepts.[^123] While post-war politics certainly amplified this criticism, the underlying concerns about his leadership were rooted in real failures and disappointments during his tenure as Chief of the General Staff.

Finally, Falkenhayn's overall strategic record as supreme commander must be judged by results. Germany's position deteriorated during his tenure from September 1914 to August 1916. The initial failures to achieve victory in 1914 were not his fault, but his strategies in 1915 and 1916 failed to improve Germany's strategic situation and in some respects worsened it.[^124] The entry of Romania into the war against Germany in August 1916, which occurred partly because Germany appeared to be losing after Verdun and the Brusilov Offensive, represented a strategic failure that Falkenhayn's later tactical success in defeating Romania could not entirely erase.[^125]
