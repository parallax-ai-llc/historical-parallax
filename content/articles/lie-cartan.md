## Summary

Élie Cartan was a French mathematician who made fundamental contributions to differential geometry, Lie group theory, and theoretical physics. He developed the theory of spinors, exterior differential forms, and the method of moving frames. His mathematical work laid crucial groundwork for general relativity and quantum mechanics. He is considered one of the greatest geometers of the 20th century.
