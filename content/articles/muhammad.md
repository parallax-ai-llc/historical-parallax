## Summary

Muhammad ibn Abdullah (c. 570 – June 8, 632 AD) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader who founded Islam and is regarded by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God (Allah). Born in Mecca into the Quraysh tribe, Muhammad received his first revelation at age 40 in the cave of Hira, where the angel Gabriel commanded him to recite what would become the Quran, Islam's holy book. After facing persecution in Mecca, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina in 622 AD (the Hijra), marking the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad established the first Islamic state, combining religious, political, and military leadership. Over the next decade, he unified the Arabian Peninsula under Islam through preaching, diplomacy, and warfare. By his death in 632 AD, Islam had spread throughout Arabia, and within a century would become one of the world's major religions, now practiced by over 1.8 billion people.

## Early Life and Background

### Birth and Childhood

Muhammad was born around 570 AD in Mecca, a prosperous trading city in the Hejaz region of the Arabian Peninsula. The exact date is uncertain, though Islamic tradition celebrates it as the 12th day of Rabi' al-Awwal. He was born into the Banu Hashim clan of the powerful Quraysh tribe, which controlled Mecca and its sacred Kaaba shrine.

Muhammad's father, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, died before his birth. His mother, Amina bint Wahb, sent the infant Muhammad to be raised by a Bedouin wet nurse named Halima in the desert, following Arabian custom to strengthen children. Islamic tradition recounts that angels visited the young Muhammad and "opened his chest" to purify his heart.

When Muhammad was six years old, his mother died, leaving him an orphan. His grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, took custody but died two years later. Muhammad was then raised by his uncle, Abu Talib, a respected merchant who protected him throughout his early prophetic career despite never converting to Islam.

### Youth and Marriage

Despite his orphan status, Muhammad grew respected for his honesty and trustworthiness, earning the nickname "al-Amin" (the trustworthy). He worked as a shepherd and later as a merchant, leading trade caravans for others.

At age 25, Muhammad married Khadija bint Khuwaylid, a wealthy widow 15 years his senior who had hired him to manage her trading business. Their marriage was monogamous (unusual for the time) and lasted 25 years until Khadija's death in 619 AD. They had six children together:
- Two sons (both died in infancy)
- Four daughters: Zainab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah

Khadija would become Muhammad's first follower and most important early supporter. Their marriage provided Muhammad financial security and social status, allowing him to pursue spiritual contemplation.

## Beginning of Prophethood

### First Revelation (610 AD)

Muhammad had long practiced spiritual retreats in the cave of Hira on Mount Jabal al-Nour outside Mecca, meditating during the month of Ramadan. At age 40, during one such retreat in 610 AD, Muhammad experienced his first revelation.

According to Islamic tradition, the angel Gabriel (Jibril) appeared to him and commanded, "Recite!" (Iqra!). Muhammad protested that he could not recite, but Gabriel persisted, eventually revealing the first verses of what would become the Quran (Surah 96:1-5):

"Recite in the name of your Lord who created—
Created man from a clinging substance.
Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous—
Who taught by the pen—
Taught man that which he knew not."

Terrified by this experience, Muhammad fled the cave. He returned home to Khadija, who comforted him and consulted her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a Christian scholar. Waraqah confirmed that Muhammad had been visited by the same angel who came to Moses, declaring him a prophet.

### Early Preaching (610-613 AD)

For the first three years, Muhammad preached privately, gathering a small group of followers including:
- Khadija (his wife, first convert)
- Ali ibn Abi Talib (his cousin, raised in his household)
- Zayd ibn Harithah (his adopted son and freed slave)
- Abu Bakr (close friend and wealthy merchant)
- Uthman ibn Affan (future caliph)

His message emphasized:
- Monotheism (Tawhid): There is only one God, Allah
- Rejection of polytheism and idol worship
- Social justice, care for orphans, widows, and the poor
- Accountability in the afterlife
- Equality of all believers regardless of tribe or status

### Public Mission and Persecution (613-622 AD)

Around 613 AD, Muhammad received a revelation commanding him to "warn your nearest kindred" publicly. He began preaching openly on Mount Safa, declaring, "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah" (the Shahada, Islam's fundamental creed).

This public preaching threatened Mecca's economic and religious establishment. The Quraysh oligarchy derived power and profit from the Kaaba, which housed hundreds of tribal idols and attracted pilgrims. Muhammad's monotheism threatened this system.

**Persecution of Muslims:**
- Early Muslims, especially slaves and poor people, suffered torture and abuse
- Bilal ibn Rabah, an African slave, was tortured but refused to renounce Islam
- Some Muslims migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 615 AD, where the Christian king granted them protection
- Muhammad's clan protection by Abu Talib prevented his direct harm, but he faced ridicule, harassment, and boycotts

**Year of Sorrow (619 AD):**
Muhammad suffered devastating personal losses:
- His wife Khadija died
- His uncle and protector Abu Talib died
Without Abu Talib's protection, persecution intensified, making Muhammad's position in Mecca increasingly untenable.

## The Hijra and Medinan Period

### Migration to Medina (622 AD)

As conditions in Mecca became unbearable, Muhammad sought new allies. Pilgrims from Yathrib (later renamed Medina, "the city of the Prophet") invited him to mediate their tribal conflicts and lead their community. In 622 AD, Muhammad and his followers undertook the Hijra (migration) from Mecca to Medina, a journey of about 280 miles.

The Hijra marks:
- Year 1 of the Islamic calendar
- The transition from persecuted minority to established community
- Muhammad's role expanding from prophet to political and military leader

In Medina, Muhammad:
- Established the Constitution of Medina, creating a pluralistic commonwealth including Muslims, Jews, and pagan tribes
- Built the first mosque (Masjid an-Nabawi)
- Organized the Muslim community (Ummah) with new social, legal, and economic structures
- Changed the qibla (prayer direction) from Jerusalem to Mecca, establishing Islamic distinct identity

### Conflict with Mecca

The Meccan Quraysh saw the growing Muslim community in Medina as a threat. Muhammad's followers also raided Meccan trade caravans, both for economic survival and retaliation for seized property left in Mecca.

**Battle of Badr (624 AD):**
- First major battle: 313 Muslims vs. ~1,000 Meccans
- Decisive Muslim victory against odds
- Established Muslim military credibility
- Interpreted as divine vindication

**Battle of Uhud (625 AD):**
- 700 Muslims vs. 3,000 Meccans
- Initial Muslim success turned to defeat when archers disobeyed orders
- Muhammad wounded; Muslims suffered casualties
- Demonstrated vulnerability but community survived

**Battle of the Trench (627 AD):**
- Meccans besieged Medina with 10,000 troops
- Muslims dug defensive trench (novel tactic in Arabia)
- Siege failed; Meccan confederation collapsed
- Marked turning point in Muslim-Meccan conflict

### Dealings with Jewish Tribes

Muhammad's relationship with Medina's Jewish tribes was complex and controversial:

**Initial Relations:**
- Constitution of Medina included Jewish tribes
- Muhammad sought recognition as prophet in Abrahamic tradition
- Expected Jewish acceptance based on shared monotheism

**Deterioration:**
- Jewish scholars rejected Muhammad's prophethood
- Accusation of aiding Meccan enemies
- Banu Qaynuqa expelled in 624 AD
- Banu Nadir expelled in 625 AD
- Banu Qurayza: After Battle of Trench, accused of betrayal; 600-900 men executed, women and children enslaved (627 AD)

This treatment of Banu Qurayza remains one of the most controversial aspects of Muhammad's life, debated by historians and Muslim scholars regarding context, scale, and justification.

## Return to Mecca and Final Years

### Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 AD)

Muhammad led 1,400 Muslims on pilgrimage to Mecca. Though initially blocked, negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah:
- 10-year truce between Muslims and Meccans
- Muslims could make pilgrimage next year
- Tribes could ally with either side
- Appeared unfavorable to Muslims initially

However, the treaty provided:
- Peace allowing Islam to spread
- Legitimacy through recognition by Mecca
- Period for consolidating power
- Within two years, Muslim strength had grown dramatically

### Conquest of Mecca (630 AD)

When Meccan allies violated the treaty by attacking Muslim allies, Muhammad marched on Mecca with 10,000 men in January 630 AD. Facing overwhelming force, Mecca surrendered with little bloodshed.

Muhammad entered the Kaaba and destroyed its 360 idols, declaring, "Truth has come and falsehood has perished." He pardoned most Meccans, including former enemies, winning many converts through magnanimity.

The Kaaba was rededicated to monotheistic worship, becoming Islam's holiest site and the qibla (direction of prayer).

### Unification of Arabia

Following Mecca's conquest, tribes throughout Arabia rapidly submitted to Muhammad's authority. By 631 AD, most of the Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam or allied with the Muslim state through:
- Voluntary conversion
- Diplomatic missions
- Military campaigns
- Enforcement of zakat (charity tax) establishing Islamic governance

Muhammad sent letters to neighboring rulers (Byzantine, Persian, Abyssinian, Egyptian) inviting them to Islam, signaling ambitions beyond Arabia.

### Farewell Pilgrimage (632 AD)

In March 632 AD, Muhammad led the Hajj (pilgrimage) with approximately 100,000 Muslims. At Mount Arafat, he delivered his Farewell Sermon, proclaiming:

- All believers are equal regardless of race or tribe
- Rights of women and slaves must be respected
- Blood feuds and usury forbidden
- "O people, no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born."
- "I leave behind two things: the Quran and my Sunnah (example)"

This sermon established core Islamic principles and suggested Muhammad knew his death was near.

## Death and Succession

### Final Illness

Returning to Medina, Muhammad fell ill with severe headaches and fever in late May 632 AD. Despite his illness, he continued leading prayers when possible. As his condition worsened, he asked permission from his wives to be nursed in Aisha's apartment.

### Death (June 8, 632 AD)

Muhammad died on June 8, 632 AD (12 Rabi' al-Awwal, 11 AH), aged about 63, with his head resting on Aisha's lap. His death shocked the community. Abu Bakr addressed the gathering:

"If anyone worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. But if anyone worships Allah, Allah is alive and immortal."

Muhammad was buried in Aisha's apartment in Medina, where his tomb remains a site of pilgrimage.

### Succession Crisis

Muhammad left no clear instructions for succession, leading to immediate controversy that would eventually split Islam:

**Abu Bakr** was chosen as first Caliph (successor) by senior companions, based on:
- Prophet's close friendship
- Leadership during Muhammad's illness
- Consensus of Medinan Muslims

However, some believed **Ali ibn Abi Talib** (Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law) should have succeeded, citing:
- Family ties
- Early conversion
- Muhammad's alleged designation at Ghadir Khumm

This dispute eventually led to the Sunni-Shia split in Islam.

## Wives and Family

### Marriages

After Khadija's death, Muhammad married multiple women, totaling 11-13 wives (sources vary). Islamic law later limited Muslim men to four wives, but Muhammad was exempted as prophet.

**Major Wives:**
- **Khadija**: First wife, monogamous marriage for 25 years
- **Sawdah**: Elderly widow, married for charity
- **Aisha**: Daughter of Abu Bakr, married young (age disputed: 6-19), became influential scholar
- **Hafsa**: Daughter of Umar, memorized Quran
- **Zaynab bint Jahsh**: Muhammad's cousin, previously married to his adopted son Zayd (controversial)
- **Maria al-Qibtiyya**: Egyptian concubine who bore his son Ibrahim

**Reasons for Multiple Marriages:**
Scholars cite various motives:
- Political alliances
- Caring for widows
- Following customs of time
- Prophetic example

### Children

Muhammad had seven children, all with Khadija except Ibrahim:
- **Sons**: Qasim, Abdullah (both died in infancy), Ibrahim (died age 2)
- **Daughters**: Zainab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, Fatimah

Only Fatimah survived Muhammad. She married Ali ibn Abi Talib, and their sons Hassan and Hussein became important figures in Islamic history, especially for Shia Muslims.
