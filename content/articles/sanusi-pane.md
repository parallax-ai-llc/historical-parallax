## Summary

Sanusi Pane (14 November 1905 – 2 January 1968) was an Indonesian writer, journalist, and historian who has been described as the most important dramatist from before the Indonesian National Revolution.[^1] Born in Muara Sipongi, Tapanuli, Dutch East Indies, Pane was a key figure in the Pujangga Baru (New Writers) literary movement that shaped Indonesian cultural identity during the colonial period.[^2] He co-founded Indonesia's national news agency Antara in 1937 and played a pivotal role in promoting Indonesian nationalism through literature, emphasizing Eastern spirituality over Western materialism.[^3] His multifaceted career included teaching, journalism, historical writing, and cultural leadership, particularly during the tumultuous years leading to Indonesian independence.

## Early Life and Background

Sanusi Pane was born on 14 November 1905 in Muara Sipongi, Tapanuli, in the Dutch East Indies (present-day North Sumatra, Indonesia) to a Muslim family.[^4] He was the eldest of the three famous Pane brothers who would all make significant contributions to Indonesian literature and politics. His younger brothers included Armijn Pane, who became famous for his novel *Belenggu*, and Lafran Pane, who founded the Indonesian Muslim Students' Association (HMI) and was later designated a national hero by President Jokowi in 2017.[^5][^6]

Their father, Sutan Pangurabaan Pane, was a scholar, teacher, and national movement activist who had been a member of the People's Council (Volksraad), providing the Pane children with an intellectual and politically conscious upbringing.[^7] Sanusi began his education at two primary schools in Sibolga before continuing to middle school, first in Padang, then in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta).[^8] While in Jakarta, Pane published his first poem, "Tanah Air" ("Homeland"), in the magazine *Jong Soematra*, marking the beginning of his literary career and demonstrating early nationalist sentiments.[^9]

The sense of nationality began to appear in Indonesian literary works in 1920 and 1921, with poems of national character published in *Jong Sumatra* magazine by Muhammad Yamin, Mohammad Hatta, Sanusi Pane, and other youths.[^10] After graduating from middle school in 1922, Pane attended the Gunung Sari (Gunung Sahari) Teachers' College (Kweekschool) in Jakarta from 1922 until 1925.[^11][^12] Upon graduation, he taught at the college for several years and took a year to study law, demonstrating his broad intellectual interests.[^13]

In 1929, a transformative moment came when Pane moved to India for a year to study Indian culture, an experience that would profoundly influence his philosophical outlook and literary work.[^14] This journey exposed him to Hindu-Buddhist philosophy, particularly the works of Rabindranath Tagore, whose influence would become evident in Pane's later poetry collections.[^15]

## Rise to Prominence

Sanusi Pane's rise as a leading figure in Indonesian literature began during the late 1920s and accelerated throughout the 1930s. Upon his return from India in 1930, Pane became a member of the editorial staff of *Timboel* magazine while continuing to teach.[^16] His early dramatic works had already been published as serials in *Timboel*: *Air Langga* (1928) and *Eenzame Garoedavlucht* (Lonely Flight of the Garuda, 1930), both written in Dutch.[^17]

By the early 1930s, Pane had become highly active in literary circles, joining the editorial board of the newspaper *Panorama* together with Liem Koen Hian, Amir Sjarifuddin, and Mohammad Yamin.[^18] *Panorama* was a newspaper belonging to Siang Po Press, a publishing house owned by the Dutch-educated jurist and politician Phoa Liong Gie.[^19]

The defining moment in Pane's literary career came in 1933 when his younger brother Armijn invited him to work on a new literary magazine, *Poedjangga Baroe* (New Poet or New Writers), which he accepted.[^20] This magazine, founded by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Amir Hamzah, and Armijn Pane, became the centerpiece of the Pujangga Baru literary movement.[^21] The "Generation of the New Literates" adopted the name *Poedjangga Baroe* to emphasize striving for renewal, attempting to break away both from the set forms of traditional Malay literature and from the yoke of colonial constraints, with the objective of creating a new poetics and a new national consciousness.[^22]

Sanusi Pane, along with the magazine's three founders, became one of the main protagonists of this movement.[^23] The magazine was published between 1933 and 1942 and became the primary forum for Indonesia's most important literary and cultural debates.[^24] However, Pane's political activism had consequences: in 1934, he was fired from his teaching position due to his membership in the Indonesian National Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia), demonstrating his commitment to nationalist causes despite personal cost.[^25]

Undeterred by this setback, Pane continued his literary and journalistic work. In mid-1936, together with Mohammad Yamin, Amir Sjarifuddin, and Liem Koen Hian, he founded the newspaper *Kebangoenan* (Awakening, 1936–1941), published by Phoa Liong Gie's Siang Po Printing Press to propagate ideas of national awakening and anti-colonialism.[^26][^27]

In 1937, Pane achieved another milestone by co-founding Antara with his brother Armijn Pane, Adam Malik, and Soemanang Soerjowinoto on 13 December.[^28] The news agency was founded when Indonesia was still a Dutch colony, by independence activists dissatisfied with the lack of local coverage by the Dutch-owned Aneta news agency.[^29] After independence, Antara became Indonesia's official news agency.[^30]

## Major Achievements

### Literary Contributions

Sanusi Pane's literary output was remarkably diverse, spanning poetry, drama, historical writing, and translation. His works spanned genres and themes, from romantic poetry collections like *Pancaran Cinta* (1926) and *Puspa Mega* (1927) to historical plays such as *Airlangga* and *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit*, exploring romantic nationalism and the intersection of Eastern spirituality and Western materialism.[^31][^32]

His poetry books demonstrate the evolution of his literary style. *Pancaran Cinta* (Rays of Love, 1926) was his first book, followed by *Puspa Mega* (Cloud Flower, 1927), which consisted almost entirely of sonnets.[^33][^34] One notable poem in sonnet form from *Puspa Mega* is "Senja" (Twilight), which consists of 14 lines and has been the subject of scholarly analysis.[^35] After his transformative year in India, Pane produced *Madah Kelana* (Hymn of the Wanderer, 1931), a collection of 49 poems that represented clear poetic progress, with the sonnet no longer predominating and various other forms being explored.[^36][^37]

*Madah Kelana* reflected his Indian journey through poem titles including references to "Taj Mahal," "To Krisyna," "Arjuna," "On the Edge of the Jamuna," and "To Dwarawati."[^38] His admiration for Indian philosophy, notably inspired by Rabindranath Tagore, informed his poems in *Madah Kelana* and emphasized the introspective quest for peace and self-identity.[^39] Research suggests that Sanusi Pane, who in his life was plagued by various miseries and sorrows, found happiness in his own heart, reflecting mystical and philosophical themes of inner searching and enlightenment.[^40]

### Dramatic Works

Pane has been described as the most important dramatist from before the Indonesian National Revolution by literary critic Muhammad Balfas.[^41] His dramatic works generally explored historical events, providing commentary on Indonesia's past while implicitly addressing contemporary colonial conditions. His historical dramas included:

- *Airlangga* (1928) – about the historical King Airlangga, written in Dutch[^42][^43]
- *Kertajaya* (1932) – about Raja Kertajaya[^44]
- *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit* (Twilight of Majapahit, 1933) – based on historical stories about the decline of the Majapahit Kingdom in East Java[^45][^46]

*Sandhyakala ning Majapahit* was first published in *Timbul* magazine Nos. 1-6, Year VII, 1932, and Nos. 3-4 February 1933.[^47] After Sanusi Pane died in 1968, the drama was republished in 1971 by Pustaka Jaya publishers in Jakarta, and in 1976 it was reprinted and made required reading for high school students in Indonesia.[^48] Jakob Soemardjo noted that almost all Pujangga Baru drama literature, including *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit*, contains a gloomy outlook about destruction and failure.[^49]

An exception to Pane's historical dramas was *Manusia Baru* (New Man/New Humanity, 1940), which presented a modern setting rather than a historical one.[^50] This drama was divided into four acts, with the final act featuring a happy ending.[^51] *Manusia Baru* contains the theme of seeking peaceful resolution to conflicts between workers and employers, reflecting the synthesis of East and West, the union of physical and spiritual, world and afterlife, idealism and materialism.[^52] Pane's novel *Manusia Baru* encapsulates his vision of blending Eastern and Western cultures, aiming to harmonize the intellectual pursuits of the West (represented by Faust) with the spiritual wisdom of the East (symbolized by Arjuna).[^53]

### Historical Writing and Translation

Beyond creative literature, Sanusi Pane made significant contributions to Indonesian historiography. He authored *Sedjarah Indonesia* (History of Indonesia), published by Balai Pustaka in Jakarta in 1950, with later editions in 1955-56 as a two-volume set and a 1965 edition.[^54][^55] The work included various historical events from the past, starting from Indonesia before the arrival of Hinduism to the national movement.[^56]

Pane attempted to write history from a national or Indonesia-centric viewpoint, departing from colonial (Neerlando-centric) historical narratives.[^57] After 1945 in Indonesia, uniform Indonesian history education was introduced under the Ministry of Education and Culture, prompting various people to attempt writing history books, and Sanusi Pane was among the most important.[^58] Common historical accounts trace the development of Indonesian nationalist historiography to pre-war anti-colonial, historical-literary works and speeches of early nationalists like Muhammad Yamin, Sanusi Pane, and Sukarno.[^59]

Pane also translated classical Javanese literature, most notably *Arjuna Wiwaha* (Arjuna's Meditation), originally composed by Mpu Kanwa during the reign of King Airlangga in the 11th century.[^60][^61] The *Arjunawiwāha* was the first kakawin (Old Javanese poetic form) to appear in the East Javan period of the Javanese classical Hindu-Buddhist era, estimated to have been finished in 1030.[^62] Pane's translation made this important piece of classical Javanese Hindu literature accessible to modern Indonesian readers, titled "Arjuna wiwaha / Mpu Kanwa ; disalin dari bahasa Jawa Kuno oleh Sanusi Pane" (copied/translated from Old Javanese by Sanusi Pane).[^63]

### Journalistic and Editorial Work

Throughout his career, Pane was highly active in literary media, sitting on the editorial boards of several publications.[^64] His journalistic achievements include:

- Editorial staff of *Timboel* magazine (1930)[^65]
- Co-founder and editor of *Poedjangga Baroe* (1933-1942)[^66]
- Editorial board member of *Panorama* (early 1930s)[^67]
- Co-founder and editor-in-chief of *Kebangoenan* newspaper (1936-1941)[^68]
- Co-founder of Antara news agency (1937)[^69]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Collaboration During Japanese Occupation

The most significant controversy in Sanusi Pane's life relates to his role during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945). After the Japanese invaded the Indies, Pane became the head of the Central Cultural Office (Keimin Bunka Shidosho).[^70] He was actively engaged with this Japanese-sponsored cultural center, which advocated the development of a true Indonesian art by promoting Indonesian culture while also educating and training Indonesian artists in the conventions of Japanese art.[^71]

Working with Japanese occupation authorities was a morally complex position that many Indonesian intellectuals faced. While some viewed such collaboration as betrayal, others argued that these positions allowed Indonesians to maintain cultural institutions and prepare for eventual independence. The available historical sources do not reveal specific criticisms or controversies Sanusi Pane faced for this collaboration, though his participation in Japanese-sponsored organizations is documented.[^72]

### Cultural Polemic: Debates and Divisions

Pane was a central figure in the "Polemik Kebudayaan" (Cultural Polemic), a significant intellectual struggle among Indonesian cultural figures in the 1930s.[^73] This debate involved an exchange of writings between Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Sanusi Pane, and Poerbatjaraka, later compiled by Achdiat Karta Mihardja and published as a book titled "Polemik Kebudayaan" by Balai Pustaka in 1948.[^74]

The central debate concerned whether modern Indonesia represented a continuation of previous eras or was entirely new, characterized by tension between Western-centric discourse and traditional orientation.[^75] Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana argued that Indonesian culture was static, inflexible, and not adaptive, so it was necessary to turn attention to dynamic Western culture.[^76]

Sanusi Pane rejected Takdir's view that the Indonesian nation should abandon past traditions and look to the West if it wanted to progress.[^77] Pane viewed Western cultures as being too materialistic, focusing on the physical aspects of life, while he viewed Eastern cultures as being more spiritualistic, influencing how humans interacted with nature—with Westerners seeking to conquer it and Easterners preferring to adapt to it.[^78] In one polemic response to Alisjahbana, Pane compared the West to Faust, who sold his soul to the devil for worldly pleasure and knowledge, and the East to Arjuna, who searched for spiritual truth.[^79]

Critics noted limitations in Pane's synthesis. J.U. Nasution observed that Pane's ideal synthesis faltered, particularly in scenes portraying cultural tension between tradition and modernity.[^80] The work exposed Pane's internal conflict between his disdain for propaganda in literature and the inevitable ideological thrust of his own narratives.[^81]

### Political Activism and Career Consequences

In 1934, Pane was fired from his teaching position due to his membership in the Indonesian National Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia).[^82] While this demonstrated his political commitment to Indonesian independence, it also showed the personal costs of political activism under colonial rule. This dismissal forced him to rely entirely on literary and journalistic work for income, though he continued his advocacy for Indonesian cultural identity and nationalism.

### Religious Syncretism and Family Conflict

Pane's religious views created tension with Islamic orthodoxy. His religious views have been described as being a "composite of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Javanese philosophy."[^83] This syncretistic approach, while intellectually consistent with his philosophy of Eastern spiritualism, placed him at odds with more conservative Islamic perspectives.

This tension culminated in a final controversy at his death. Before he died on 2 January 1968 in Jakarta, Pane requested that his body be treated in a Hindu manner; however, his family did not grant the request as they felt it would be against Islamic teachings.[^84] Pane was born to a Muslim family, and his family ultimately honored their Islamic tradition rather than Pane's personal spiritual evolution.[^85]

---

## Personal Life

Sanusi Pane married and had six children with his wife, though the name of his wife is not mentioned in available historical sources.[^86] He was the elder brother to writer Armijn Pane and Lafran Pane.[^87] The Pane brothers came from an intellectually distinguished family, with their father, Sutan Pangurabaan Pane, being a scholar, teacher, and national movement activist who had been a member of the People's Council (Volksraad).[^88]

### Personality and Character

Pane was reportedly very modest and humble, characteristics that defined his interactions throughout his life. He told J. U. Nasution—who was writing a biography on Pane—that he was nothing and should not be interviewed.[^89] On another occasion, he refused a Satya Lencana Kebudayaan award from President Sukarno, stating that Indonesia had given him everything but he had done nothing for it.[^90] This profound humility reflected his philosophical beliefs about service and duty to the nation.

### Religious and Philosophical Views

Pane's religious views have been described as being a "composite of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Javanese philosophy."[^91] This syncretistic spirituality informed his literary work and cultural philosophy. He viewed Western cultures as too materialistic, focusing on physical aspects of life, while Eastern cultures he viewed as more spiritualistic.[^92] He saw this as influencing the way in which humans interacted with nature, with Westerners seeking to conquer it and Easterners preferring to adapt to it.[^93]

Many of his poems dealt with philosophical issues, and Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas calls Pane the "first [Indonesian poet] who used his poetry to reveal his inner self."[^94] Pane's poems used everyday language, including foreign loanwords, and he limited his use of the local languages of Indonesia, including his native language Batak.[^95] Structurally, his poems resembled the old Malay form pantun, although he also wrote several sonnets.[^96]

### Linguistic Approach

Pane's approach to language reflected his nationalist vision. He was active in various nationalist organizations including Jong Sumatranen Bond, Jong Bataks Bond and Gerindo, later joining Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI).[^97] Sanusi Pane worked to cultivate love for the homeland through memories of the nation's past history, and the nationalist elements in his works were created so that Indonesia would return to Eastern culture and not be gripped by Western (Dutch) imperialism.[^98]

### Final Years

Pane died in Jakarta on 2 January 1968.[^99] His death marked the end of an era for Indonesian literature, as he was one of the last surviving major figures of the Pujangga Baru movement that had shaped Indonesian cultural identity during the colonial period. The controversy surrounding his burial request—wanting Hindu rites but receiving Islamic burial—reflected the complex religious and cultural tensions that characterized his life and work.[^100]

---

## Legacy

Sanusi Pane left an indelible legacy in Indonesian culture as a writer, poet, and playwright who emphasized the importance of cultural identity in the face of modernization.[^101] He was among the most prolific writers during Indonesia's independence period, alongside Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana and Armijn Pane, dealing with cultural topics such as the balance between Indonesian traditions and the influences of the West.[^102] Around the time when Indonesia declared independence from the Netherlands, authors helped to speculate on and define what it meant to be Indonesian, with Sanusi Pane being one of the most important voices.[^103]

### Literary Innovations

Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas calls Pane the "first [Indonesian poet] who used his poetry to reveal his inner self," marking an important innovation in Indonesian poetry.[^104] Balfas also called Pane the most important Indonesian dramatist from before the national revolution.[^105] His works spanned genres and themes, exploring romantic nationalism and the intersection of Eastern spirituality and Western materialism.[^106]

Pane's dramatic works, particularly *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit*, continued to influence Indonesian literature long after his death. After he died in 1968, *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit* was republished in 1971 and in 1976 was made required reading for high school students in Indonesia, ensuring that generations of Indonesian students engaged with his vision of Indonesian identity rooted in pre-colonial greatness.[^107]

### Institutional Contributions

Pane's co-founding of Antara news agency in 1937 represents one of his most enduring institutional legacies.[^108] After independence, Antara became Indonesia's official news agency and remains so today, providing a national Indonesian voice in journalism.[^109] The founding of Antara was significant in Indonesia's pre-independence period, as it provided an indigenous voice during colonial rule and later played a crucial role in Indonesia's independence movement.[^110]

His role in *Poedjangga Baroe* magazine (1933-1942) helped establish a forum for Indonesian literary and cultural expression during the colonial period.[^111] The magazine's special edition dedicated to Rabindranath Tagore upon his death in 1941 reflected Pane's influence in bringing South Asian cultural and philosophical ideas to Indonesian audiences.[^112]

### Historiographical Impact

Pane's *Sedjarah Indonesia* (History of Indonesia) represented an important effort to write Indonesian history from an Indonesia-centric perspective rather than a colonial viewpoint.[^113] His historical writing influenced the development of Indonesian nationalist historiography, with common historical accounts tracing this development to pre-war anti-colonial works of early nationalists like Muhammad Yamin, Sanusi Pane, and Sukarno.[^114]

The ideas propounded in Pane's historical-literary works unmistakably found their way into the bedrock of nationalist historiography, whose development gained impetus under the aegis of Japanese occupation and continued after independence.[^115]

### Cultural Philosophy

Pane's emphasis on Eastern spirituality versus Western materialism provided a philosophical framework that many Indonesian intellectuals adopted. In the 1920s and 1930s, writers such as Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana and Sanusi Pane debated whether Indonesia had to abandon its traditional values and fully embrace Western modernity or vice versa.[^116] Pane's position—advocating for Eastern spiritual values while selectively engaging with Western knowledge—offered a middle path that influenced Indonesian cultural discourse.

His work has been analyzed through postcolonial perspectives, with scholars examining how Pane's writings addressed themes of indigenous identity, nationalism, freedom, and resistance.[^117] This ongoing scholarly engagement demonstrates the continued relevance of his work to understanding Indonesian identity formation.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Literary scholars and historians widely recognize Sanusi Pane as a pioneering figure in modern Indonesian literature. Muhammad Balfas, a prominent Indonesian writer and literary critic, provides perhaps the most significant endorsement, calling Pane the "first [Indonesian poet] who used his poetry to reveal his inner self" and "the most important Indonesian dramatist from before the national revolution."[^118][^119]

Contemporary scholarship continues to affirm Pane's importance. The 2024 article "The Legacy of Sanusi Pane: A Literary Pioneer and Champion of Indonesian Culture" describes him as having "left an indelible legacy in Indonesian culture," noting that "he remained humble about his contributions, declining a government award and insisting his work was a duty to the nation."[^120]

Academic studies recognize Pane's role in defining Indonesian cultural identity. Research notes that "Sanusi Pane was a writer, poet, and playwright who emphasized the importance of cultural identity in the face of modernization."[^121] His multifaceted contributions—spanning poetry, drama, journalism, historiography, and translation—demonstrate the breadth of his influence on Indonesian intellectual life.

Scholars appreciate Pane's philosophical depth and his synthesis of Eastern spiritual traditions. His admiration for Indian philosophy, particularly Rabindranath Tagore, informed his poems and "emphasized the introspective quest for peace and self-identity."[^122] Academic research, including an article titled "Pancaran Filosofis Rabindranath Tagore dan Hinduisme pada Sanusi Pane: Satu Pendekatan Genetik" (The Philosophical Influence of Rabindranath Tagore and Hinduism on Sanusi Pane: A Genetic Approach), explores the sophisticated philosophical underpinnings of his work.[^123]

His role in Indonesian nationalism receives positive assessment. Research indicates that "around the time when Indonesia declared independence from the Netherlands, authors helped to speculate on and define what it meant to be Indonesian, with some of the most prolific writers of that period including Sanusi Pane, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, and Armijn Pane."[^124] His work cultivated "love for the homeland through memories of the nation's past history," with nationalist elements designed "so that Indonesia would return to Eastern culture and not be gripped by Western (Dutch) imperialism."[^125]

Educational institutions have affirmed Pane's importance by including his work in curricula. After his death, *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit* was reprinted in 1976 and made required reading for high school students in Indonesia, ensuring continued engagement with his vision of Indonesian identity.[^126]

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of Sanusi Pane's work identify several limitations and problematic aspects. J.U. Nasution, in his biographical work on Pane, noted that "Pane's ideal synthesis faltered, particularly in scenes portraying cultural tension between tradition and modernity."[^127] The work exposed "Pane's internal conflict between his disdain for propaganda in literature and the inevitable ideological thrust of his own narratives."[^128] This critique suggests that Pane's philosophical ideals did not always translate successfully into dramatic form.

Jakob Soemardjo observed that "almost all Pujangga Baru drama literature, including *Sandhyakala ning Majapahit* by Sanusi Pane, contains a gloomy outlook about destruction and failure."[^129] This assessment suggests that Pane's historical dramas, while important, may have reinforced pessimistic narratives rather than offering more constructive visions for Indonesia's future.

Pane's collaboration with Japanese occupation authorities as head of the Central Cultural Office remains historically controversial.[^130] While working within Japanese-sponsored institutions may have been necessary for cultural preservation, and many Indonesian nationalists took similar positions, this collaboration raises questions about accommodation with authoritarian rule. The Keimin Bunka Shidosho, which Pane headed, was part of the Japanese occupation's cultural propaganda apparatus.[^131]

His religious syncretism and rejection of Islamic orthodoxy troubled more conservative Muslims. His religious views, described as "a composite of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Javanese philosophy," represented a departure from mainstream Islamic practice.[^132] The family's refusal to honor his deathbed request for Hindu burial rites reflects this religious tension.[^133]

In the Cultural Polemic with Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, some viewed Pane's emphasis on Eastern spirituality and rejection of Western modernity as potentially backward-looking. While Alisjahbana's pro-Western stance has also been criticized, his argument that Indonesian culture needed dynamism and adaptability challenged Pane's more traditionalist position.[^134]

Pane's elitism and limited accessibility present another criticism. His education, foreign travel, and immersion in classical Javanese and Indian culture placed him in an intellectual elite far removed from ordinary Indonesians. His poetry's philosophical complexity and cultural references to Hindu-Buddhist epics would have been inaccessible to most of his contemporaries.

Finally, some critics note that Pane's vision of Indonesian identity was heavily Javanese-centric, drawing predominantly from Majapahit and other Javanese historical narratives. This approach potentially marginalized the diverse cultures of Indonesia's many ethnic groups, regions, and traditions beyond Java.
