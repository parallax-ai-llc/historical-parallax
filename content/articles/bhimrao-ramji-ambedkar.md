## Summary

B. R. Ambedkar was an Indian jurist, social reformer, and the principal architect of the Indian Constitution who led a mass conversion movement to Buddhism. Born into an 'untouchable' (Dalit) caste, he fought against caste discrimination throughout his life. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism along with hundreds of thousands of followers, reviving Buddhism in India. His Navayana (Neo-Buddhism) reinterpreted Buddhism as a religion of social equality.
