## Summary

The "Miracle of the Sun" is one of the most witnessed paranormal events in history. On October 13, 1917, a crowd of approximately **70,000 people**—including believers, skeptics, and curious journalists—gathered in a muddy field in Fátima, Portugal. They were there because three shepherd children (Lúcia, Francisco, and Jacinta) had prophesied that the Virgin Mary would appear and perform a miracle at noon.

While the Catholic Church recognizes the event as a divine miracle, modern UFO researchers like **Jacques Vallée** argue it shares striking similarities with UFO encounters: a silver disc that descended from the clouds, spun rapidly, changed colors, and emitted heat that instantly dried the sodden clothes of the crowd.[^1]

## The Event (October 13, 1917)

### The Context

The crowd had gathered in torrential rain. They stood in ankle-deep mud, waiting for the prophecy.

- **The Clouds Part:** At noon, the rain stopped abruptly. The heavy clouds broke, and the sun appeared.
- **The "Silver Disc":** Witnesses described the sun not as a blinding light but as an opaque, spinning silver disc that could be looked at directly without hurting the eyes.
- **The Dance:** The disc began to "dance" in the sky, whirling rapidly and emitting shafts of colored light (red, violet, blue, yellow) that painted the landscape and the crowd.
- **The Plummet:** Suddenly, the disc appeared to detach from the sky and plunge toward the earth in a zig-zag motion. The crowd screamed, believing the world was ending.
- **The Aftermath:** The object retreated to the sky. Astonishingly, the thousands of people who had been soaked to the bone found their clothes and the ground completely dry.[^2]

## Interpretations

### Catholic Church

The Church declared the event "worthy of belief" in 1930, attributing it to the intervention of Our Lady of Fátima.

### UFO / VALLEE Hypothesis

Researcher Jacques Vallée (in _Passport to Magonia_) and others suggest the event was a classic UFO close encounter, misinterpreted through a religious lens by a pre-spaceflight peasantry.

- **Characteristics:**
  - **Silver Disc:** A common description of UFOs.
  - **Falling Leaf/Zig-Zag Motion:** A hallmark of UFO flight patterns, not celestial mechanics.
  - **Heat/Radiation:** The instant drying of clothes suggests microwave or other radiation often reported in close encounters.
  - **"Angel Hair":** In earlier apparitions at Fátima (Sept 1917), witnesses reported "white petals" falling from the sky that vanished on touch—strikingly similar to "angel hair" residue found in UFO cases.[^3]

### Skeptics / Meteorology

Skeptics propose "sundogs" (parhelia) or mass hallucination/hysteria caused by staring at the sun for too long (retinal distortion).

- **Counter-point:** The event was seen by people miles away from the main crowd who were not part of the emotional gathering, and the physical effect of drying clothes is hard to explain with hallucination.[^4]
