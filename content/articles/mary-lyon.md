## Summary

Mary Lyon proposed the Lyon hypothesis in 1961, which states that one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals is randomly inactivated in each cell. This X-inactivation explains why calico cats have patches of different colors and has profound implications for understanding X-linked genetic diseases. The concept is now called lyonization.
