## Summary

Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a German composer and pianist who remains one of the most celebrated figures in Western music history. A crucial figure in the transition between Classical and Romantic eras, Beethoven expanded the scope, ambition, and emotional depth of instrumental music. His nine symphonies, especially the revolutionary Ninth with its "Ode to Joy," redefined what orchestral music could achieve. Remarkably, Beethoven created many of his greatest works after becoming almost completely deaf—a testament to his extraordinary inner musical vision. His personal struggle against fate, embodied in his music and his famous declaration "I will seize fate by the throat," made him an archetypal Romantic hero and symbol of artistic genius triumphing over adversity.

## Deafness

**Onset (~1796):**
Began losing hearing in mid-20s. Kept secret as long as possible.

**Heiligenstadt Testament (1802):**
Devastated, Beethoven wrote anguished letter to brothers about despair and suicidal thoughts, but resolved to continue for his art:
> "I would have put an end to my life—only art held me back."

**Progression:**
- By 1814: Largely deaf, stopped performing
- Used conversation books (visitors wrote questions)
- Conducted Symphony No. 9 premiere (1824) but couldn't hear applause—had to be turned around to see audience's standing ovation

**Composing Deaf:**
Created some of greatest music while unable to hear it externally—heard it entirely in his imagination.

## Personality and Life

**Character:**
- Famously difficult, temperamental
- Politically idealistic (republican sympathies)
- Unkempt appearance
- Multiple failed romantic relationships
- Never married; idealized "Immortal Beloved" (identity debated)

> "So he too is nothing more than an ordinary man!"

**Nephew Karl:**
After brother's death, fought for custody of nephew Karl. Relationship troubled; Karl attempted suicide (1826).
