## Summary

Count Itagaki Taisuke (板垣退助) was a Japanese samurai, military commander, and politician who became known as the "father of Japanese democracy" and the "Jean-Jacques Rousseau of Japan." Born in the Tosa Domain in 1837, he distinguished himself as a military leader during the Boshin War before founding Japan's first political party, the Liberal Party (Jiyūtō), in 1881.[^1][^2] As the central figure of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, Itagaki's advocacy for parliamentary democracy and constitutional government profoundly influenced the political development of Meiji Japan, ultimately contributing to the establishment of the Meiji Constitution in 1889.[^3][^4] His famous declaration after surviving an assassination attempt in 1882—"Itagaki may die, but liberty will not!"—became a rallying cry for democratic reform and cemented his legacy as a champion of civil liberties in Japan.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Itagaki Taisuke was born on May 21, 1837, in Kōchi (then known as Tosa Domain) on the island of Shikoku, as the eldest son of Masashige Inui.[^6][^7] He came from a middle-ranking samurai family with a distinguished lineage—the Inui clan served as Umamawariyaku (body guards) with a stipend of 220 koku, holding the social status of Joshi (superior warrior).[^8] His family took pride in their descent from Nobukata Itagaki, a famous samurai who fought alongside the legendary warlord Shingen Takeda during the Sengoku period.[^9]

Unlike many samurai of his generation, young Itagaki displayed unusual curiosity and intellectual breadth that earned him a reputation as something of an oddity among his peers.[^10] While traditional samurai education focused on swordsmanship and Confucian classics, Itagaki pursued studies in gunnery, Western military tactics, and foreign policy—subjects that deviated from conventional samurai training.[^11] After studies in Kōchi and Edo (modern Tokyo), he was appointed as sobayonin (councillor) to Tosa daimyō Yamauchi Toyoshige in 1861, taking charge of accounts and military matters at the domain's Edo residence.[^12]

What distinguished Itagaki most notably among his contemporaries was his egalitarian disposition. Although elite samurai rarely interacted with lower-ranked people at the time, Itagaki enjoyed spending time with commoners and listening to their life situations—a trait considered highly unusual for someone of his status.[^13] This early empathy for ordinary people would later inform his democratic philosophy and populist political approach. His intellectual pursuits and social consciousness positioned him uniquely among the samurai who would lead Japan's transformation during the turbulent Meiji period.

## Rise to Power

Itagaki's ascent to national prominence began with his military leadership during the Boshin War (1868-1869), the civil conflict that ended the Tokugawa shogunate and restored imperial rule.[^14] As military commander of Tosa Domain forces, Itagaki reorganized and modernized his domain's army prior to the outbreak of hostilities, demonstrating both strategic foresight and organizational capability.[^15] He led the Jinshotai corps and served as a staff officer, commanding forces along the Tosan-do Road campaign.[^16]

Itagaki achieved his first major military victory at the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma, where his forces defeated the legendary Shinsengumi led by Isami Kondo.[^17] Together with Takamori Saigo of Satsuma Domain, Itagaki's forces dealt a devastating blow to Tokugawa armies at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, a turning point in the war.[^18] During the subsequent Tohoku campaign, he successfully captured territories including the Sendai and Aizu Domains, further establishing his reputation as a capable military commander.[^19]

Following the Meiji Restoration's success in 1868, Itagaki emerged as the principal political figure from Tosa Domain and claimed a significant position in the new Meiji government.[^20] In 1869, he was appointed Sanyo (Councilor), joining an elite group of first-term councilors that included Takayoshi Kido from Choshu Domain, Takamori Saigo from Satsuma Domain, and Shigenobu Okuma from Saga Domain—the architects of modern Japan.[^21]

However, Itagaki's position in the oligarchy proved short-lived. In 1873, a major political crisis erupted over the Seikanron debate—a proposal for a punitive military expedition against Korea.[^22] Itagaki supported the invasion alongside Saigo Takamori, Eto Shimpei, and Goto Shojiro, but they were opposed by leaders including Okubo Toshimichi, Iwakura Tomomi, and Okuma Shigenobu, who had recently returned from the Iwakura Mission to the West and argued that Japan should prioritize internal reforms and modernization.[^23] When the proposal was rejected in October 1873, Itagaki resigned from government along with approximately 600 other military men and bureaucrats.[^24] This resignation proved transformative, redirecting Itagaki's energies from military command and government administration toward political activism and democratic reform.

## Major Achievements

### Founding Japan's First Political Association (1874)

Immediately following his resignation, on January 12, 1874, Itagaki founded the Aikoku Kōtō (Public Party of Patriots), Japan's first political association.[^25] Formed together with Etō Shinpei, Gotō Shōjirō, and others, the party's prospectus—heavily influenced by Western political thought—declared that rights were "bestowed upon men equally by heaven" and could not be taken away by human power.[^26] This represented a revolutionary application of natural rights philosophy to Japanese political discourse.

### The 1874 Memorial for Popular Assembly

Just five days later, on January 17, 1874, Itagaki and eight associates, including Gotō Shōjirō and Etō Shimpei, submitted the historic "Memorial for the Establishment of an Elective Assembly" (民撰議院設立建白書) to the government.[^27] This document, also known as the Tosa Memorial, skillfully critiqued the Meiji oligarchy's monopoly on power, stating that "the governing power lies not with the Crown... nor with the people... but with the officials alone," and accused the government of arbitrary rule.[^28] The memorial argued that to strengthen the nation and promote the people's welfare, a "council-chamber chosen by the people" should be established, allowing for open discussion of public affairs.[^29]

Although the government initially dismissed the memorial as the work of disgruntled former officials, its publication in the press sparked a nationwide debate on representative government, popular rights, and constitutionalism.[^30] This memorial is considered the foundational event of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement (Jiyū Minken Undō), which would dominate Japanese politics for the next two decades.[^31]

### Founding the Liberal Party (1881)

Itagaki's most significant organizational achievement came on October 29, 1881, when he officially founded the Liberal Party (Jiyūtō) with himself as president.[^32] The Jiyūtō was Japan's first modern political party, composed of a loose network of rural political societies with membership based on the ideals of liberal democracy under a constitutional monarchy.[^33] The party's prospectus, written mainly by Nakae Chōmin (sometimes called the "Eastern Rousseau"), declared: "Liberty is the natural state of man and the preservation of liberty is man's great duty."[^34]

According to Itagaki, the "purpose" of Jiyuto was to "enjoy nature-given happiness, by propagating the truth of liberty, cultivating popular power, and limiting artificial power."[^35] The party advocated a radical agenda of democratic reform and popular sovereignty, espousing the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau—earning Itagaki himself the sobriquet "the Jean-Jacques Rousseau of Japan."[^36] The party drew its main support from rural landowners resentful of heavy land taxes and discontented former samurai who no longer received government stipends.[^37]

### Government Service and the First Party Cabinet

After years in opposition, Itagaki joined the second Itō cabinet as Minister of Home Affairs in 1896, though his tenure was brief due to disagreements over cabinet appointments and political strategy.[^38] More significantly, in June 1898, Itagaki's Liberal Party merged with Ōkuma Shigenobu's Progressive Party (Shimpotō) to form the Constitutional Party (Kenseitō).[^39] On June 30, 1898, Ōkuma became Prime Minister with Itagaki as Home Minister, forming what is considered Japan's first party cabinet—a historic milestone in Japanese parliamentary democracy.[^40]

### Contribution to Constitutional Government

Itagaki's Freedom and People's Rights Movement successfully pressured the Meiji oligarchs to move toward constitutional government.[^41] By channeling the discontent of various groups into a political movement that called for a constitution and a national assembly, he played a crucial part in compelling the government to promulgate the Meiji Constitution in 1889 and establish the Imperial Diet in 1890.[^42] While the final constitutional document preserved significant oligarchic power, it granted more freedoms than activists had anticipated, including freedom of religious belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association within legal boundaries.[^43]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Accusations of Political Opportunism

Itagaki was frequently criticized by contemporaries and later historians as a political opportunist willing to compromise with the oligarchy and abandon his followers for government positions, as he did in 1875 when he briefly rejoined the government.[^44] These criticisms intensified during his controversial European tour from November 1882 to June 1883, which was funded by the Mitsui company—a firm with close government ties.[^45] This funding led to widespread accusations that Itagaki had been "bought off," and the trip was widely seen as a government attempt to remove him from the Japanese political scene at a critical juncture.[^46] The incident sparked a bitter conflict between the Jiyūtō and its rival, the Rikken Kaishintō led by Ōkuma Shigenobu, which accused Itagaki of betraying the movement.[^47]

### The Short-Lived Ōkuma-Itagaki Cabinet

The historic first party cabinet of 1898 collapsed after only 132 days, making it the shortest cabinet of the Meiji Era.[^48] During a cabinet crisis in October 1898, Itagaki was pressured by conservative factions and the military, and controversially denounced Education Minister Ozaki Yukio to the emperor.[^49] His subsequent resignation on October 27, 1898, followed by those of his supporters, led to the fall of the entire cabinet.[^50] This episode reinforced criticisms that Itagaki prioritized political survival over principled leadership.

### Radical Excesses During His Absence

During Itagaki's European tour, party leadership under more radical elements embraced extreme tactics, endorsing localized uprisings and disorders that invited harsh government reprisals including arrests, torture of activists, and closures of liberal newspapers.[^51] While these actions occurred in his absence, critics argued that Itagaki's leadership style—charismatic but sometimes lacking in strategic discipline—failed to establish institutional controls that might have prevented such excesses.

### Evolution of Democratic Vision

Scholars have noted contradictions in Itagaki's democratic credentials. Initially, his vision for representative assembly was elitist—the 1874 memorial suggested limiting the franchise to samurai and wealthier farmers and merchants, "who he believed had produced the leaders of the revolution of 1868."[^52] Some historians argue that the movement's efforts were "more geared to regaining power than any deep advocacy of democracy per se," though they acknowledge that the movement "developed in time into a truly national drive."[^53] During its early years, the Popular Rights Movement "was neither especially democratic nor very popular," with a narrow base of support consisting mainly of former Tosa samurai "who had little confidence in the wisdom of the common people."[^54]

### Restraining Former Allies

During his tenure as Minister of Home Affairs from April to September 1896, Itagaki focused on enforcing electoral laws while restraining radical elements within the Freedom and People's Rights Movement that had previously aligned with his leadership, prioritizing national cohesion over ideological purity.[^55] This pragmatic turn disappointed many of his more radical supporters who saw it as abandoning the movement's revolutionary potential.

## Personal Life

### Family and Marriages

Itagaki's personal life reflected the complex family structures common among prominent Meiji-era Japanese men. He had multiple wives throughout his life, with his fourth wife, Kinuko, being the most documented.[^56] Kinuko was the adopted daughter of Viscount Fukuoka Takachika and the seventh daughter of Araki Isoji, whom Itagaki married on March 6, 1889.[^57] Born on June 8, 1859, she outlived her husband by nearly two decades, dying on April 13, 1938.[^58]

### Children

Itagaki fathered multiple children with different partners, reflecting practices common among elite men of his era:[^59]

**Sons:**
- Hokotaro (eldest son, born July 4, 1868, mother's family name: Kotani)
- Inui Seishi (second son, born April 18, 1868, mother: Hagiwara Fukusai's daughter Yaku)
- Araki Magozaburo (third son, born October 6, 1885, mother: Araki Isoji's daughter Kinu, who later became his wife)
- Itagaki Masami (fourth son, born April 4, 1889, mother's family name: Fukuoka)
- Inui Muichi (fifth son, born November 14, 1897, mother's family name: Fukuoka)

**Daughters:**
- Hyo (eldest daughter, born August 4, 1860, married Kataoka Kumanosuke, mother's family name: Kotani)
- Gun (second daughter, married Miyaji Shigeharu)
- Ryoko (fifth daughter, born January 1, 1895, married Oyama Tomoe, mother's family name: Fukuoka)

### Personality and Character

Itagaki was described as having "a selfless character with no thirst for money and with no wiliness—he was simply 'a nice person,'" though this also meant "he was not necessarily an adept politician, a profession that requires being broad-minded enough to deal with all sorts of good and evil."[^60] He was characterized as "a unique kid who was interested in many things," and because his interests were unusual, "people called him a weirdo."[^61]

His compassionate nature was dramatically demonstrated after his assassination attempt in 1882, when Itagaki himself requested the release of his attacker—an extraordinary act of forgiveness.[^62] He successfully won hearts "not only of his people but even his rivals' by always taking a fair position during arguments and rarely resorting to violence."[^63] His charismatic leadership style and ability to speak from the same platform as commoners—a rarity among ex-samurai of his status—contributed to his enduring popularity.[^64]

### Personal Interests

Beyond politics, Itagaki maintained diverse interests throughout his life. He was particularly devoted to sumo wrestling, building a sumo dojo in his home and becoming involved in naming the Kokugikan (the national sumo arena).[^65] This devotion was honored at his funeral, where 16 rikishi (sumo wrestlers) carried his coffin.[^66]

## Legacy

### Father of Japanese Democracy

Itagaki Taisuke's primary legacy remains his role as the central figure in Japan's Freedom and People's Rights Movement and his pivotal influence on the political development of Meiji Japan.[^67] By channeling the discontent of various groups into a political movement calling for a constitution and national assembly, he played a crucial part in compelling the Meiji oligarchs to move toward constitutional government.[^68] His organization of the Jiyūtō as a national party with a broad-based platform was a landmark in Japanese political history.[^69]

### Enduring Cultural Presence

As a groundbreaker in Japan's democratic politics, Itagaki enjoyed high popularity even after his death.[^70] His portrait was depicted on the 100-yen Bank of Japan note issued in 1953 and circulated until 1974, ensuring his image remained familiar to generations of Japanese citizens.[^71] Statues and monuments commemorate his legacy throughout Japan, most notably the prominent bronze statue at Kochi Castle created by Hakuun Motoyama (a relative and disciple of Koun Takamura), which depicts Itagaki with his right arm outstretched as if addressing a political rally.[^72] The Itagaki Taisuke Birthplace Monument in Kochi further honors his origins.[^73]

### The Immortal Cry for Liberty

Itagaki's most enduring legacy is the legendary declaration attributed to him after being stabbed in Gifu on April 6, 1882: "Itagaki may die, but liberty will not!" (板垣死すとも自由は死せず).[^74] While there is historical debate about whether Itagaki himself or journalist Shinsuke Komuro actually uttered these words, the phrase became synonymous with Itagaki and served as a rallying cry for democratic reform throughout the Meiji period and beyond.[^75] The incident elevated Itagaki's status as a heroic leader of the democratic cause, and his survival of the attack (after being initially refused treatment by local doctors who feared the anti-Jiyūtō governor's displeasure) added to his mystique.[^76]

### Principled Opposition to Hereditary Privilege

True to his democratic principles, Itagaki maintained a complicated relationship with the peerage system. When offered the title of Count (Hakushaku) in 1884, he accepted only on the condition that it not be passed to his heirs.[^77] He was finally granted the title on July 5, 1887, after declining twice and only accepting the third offer because, as he was told, "the third declination would be irreverent."[^78] Denying the hereditary peerage system and insisting on "life-peer theory," Itagaki led a campaign asking the peerage nationwide for their views on the matter.[^79] True to his belief that one should "leave no fortune for one's posterity," he did not allow his children to inherit his title.[^80] Upon his death on July 16, 1919, he was posthumously bestowed the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, the highest class of that decoration.[^81]

### Mixed Historical Assessment

Itagaki's legacy embodies the complexities and contradictions of Japan's early democratic movement. While celebrated as a champion of liberty and representative government, his political thought evolved from elitist origins to more genuinely populist positions as the movement grew.[^82] His willingness to compromise with the oligarchy and pragmatic approach to politics disappointed some purists, but ultimately contributed to incremental democratic progress. His influence on Japan's constitutional development, though imperfect, laid groundwork for future democratic movements.

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many scholars and democratic activists view Itagaki as a pioneering figure whose activism in favor of parliamentary democracy was "a pivotal influence on the political development of Meiji Japan."[^83] His establishment of Japan's first political party and his leadership of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement represented groundbreaking applications of Western liberal democratic theory to Japanese political culture.[^84] The Association for Asian Studies recognizes his memorial to the government as sparking "a nationwide debate" that fundamentally shaped the trajectory toward constitutional government.[^85]

Libertarian scholars particularly celebrate Itagaki as "the first Japanese classical liberal," highlighting his natural rights philosophy and his declaration that liberty is "the natural state of man."[^86] His prospectus for the Aikoku Kōtō, which declared that rights are "bestowed upon men equally by heaven" and cannot be taken away by human power, represented a radical break from Confucian political philosophy that emphasized hierarchical order over individual rights.[^87]

Supporters emphasize Itagaki's evolution from an elite samurai perspective toward genuine populism, noting that as the movement "absorbed a wider base of support, particularly from the rural gentry and commoners, Itagaki's views appeared to become more populist."[^88] His organization of the Jiyūtō "as a national party with a broad-based platform was a landmark in Japanese political history."[^89] His personal qualities—selflessness, compassion, egalitarian instincts, and willingness to speak alongside commoners—distinguished him from many Meiji leaders and contributed to his enduring popularity.[^90]

Defenders also point to his fusion of "samurai ethos with Western liberalism," creating a distinctly Japanese approach to democratic politics that resonated with diverse constituencies.[^91] His ability to channel widespread discontent into organized political action, forcing the oligarchy to grant concessions, demonstrated effective leadership in an era of rapid transformation. The fact that he became known as "the Jean-Jacques Rousseau of Japan" reflects the profound impact of his democratic advocacy on Japanese political consciousness.[^92]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Itagaki was fundamentally "a political opportunist who was willing to compromise with the oligarchy and abandon his followers for a post in the government."[^93] His acceptance of government funding from the Mitsui company for his 1882-83 European tour, and his periodic returns to government service, supported accusations that he had been "bought off" and was willing to betray the movement for personal advancement.[^94] The bitter conflict this sparked with the Rikken Kaishintō, which "accused Itagaki of betraying the movement," damaged his credibility among fellow reformers.[^95]

Historians note that the movement's initial motivations were questionable: "their efforts were more geared to regaining power than any deep advocacy of democracy per se."[^96] The movement's early phase "was neither especially democratic nor very popular," with support limited to "mainly small groups of elites" consisting of "former samurai from Itagaki's old domain of Tosa who had little confidence in the wisdom of the common people or in their experience and ability to participate in the political process."[^97] The 1874 memorial's proposal to limit the franchise to samurai and wealthy merchants contradicted later claims of universal democratic principles.[^98]

Critics also point to Itagaki's political limitations: while "a nice person," he "was not necessarily an adept politician, a profession that requires being broad-minded enough to deal with all sorts of good and evil."[^99] His charismatic but sometimes undisciplined leadership style contributed to factional divisions and radical excesses within the movement. His denunciation of Education Minister Ozaki during the 1898 cabinet crisis, and his subsequent resignation that toppled Japan's first party cabinet after only 132 days, demonstrated questionable judgment at critical moments.[^100]

Some scholars view his restraint of radical elements during his 1896 tenure as Home Minister—enforcing electoral laws against former allies—as evidence of abandoning revolutionary potential in favor of establishment acceptance.[^101] His European tour, "widely seen as an attempt by the government to remove Itagaki from the Japanese political scene at a critical time," showed how the oligarchy successfully neutralized his opposition through co-optation rather than confrontation.[^102] Overall, critics argue that while Itagaki played an important historical role, his legacy is compromised by opportunism, inconsistency, and a tendency to prioritize personal advancement over principled democratic advocacy.
