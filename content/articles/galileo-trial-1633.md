## Overview

The Trial of Galileo Galilei (1633) is the defining historical episode of the conflict between science and religious authority. Galileo, the "father of modern science," was summoned by the Roman Inquisition for defending Copernican heliocentrism (the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun), which contradicted the Catholic Church's geocentric interpretation of Scripture. Forced to recant his views to avoid execution, Galileo spent the final nine years of his life under house arrest. The trial became a powerful symbol of intellectual freedom versus dogmatic censorship.

## Background

### Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism

**Aristotle & Ptolemy:**
Prevailing view for 1,500 years: Earth is stationary center of universe. Supported by Church ("Sun, stand thou still" - Joshua 10:12).

**Copernicus (1543):**
Proposed Earth moves around Sun. Church initially tolerated it as mathematical "hypothesis," not physical reality.

### Galileo's Discoveries

**Telescope (1609):**
Galileo improved telescope and looked up.
- **Moons of Jupiter:** Proved not everything orbits Earth.
- **Phases of Venus:** Proved Venus orbits Sun.

**Starry Messenger (1610):**
Published findings. Became celebrity.

### First Clash (1616)

**Inquisition Warning:**
The Church officially declared heliocentrism "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical."

**Cardinal Bellarmine:**
Ordered Galileo not to "hold or defend" the theory. Galileo agreed.

---

## The Trigger: *Dialogue*

### Pope Urban VIII

**Maffeo Barberini:**
Old friend of Galileo, elected Pope (1623). Encouraged Galileo to write—provided he treat heliocentrism hypothetically.

### *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems* (1632)

**The Book:**
A conversation between three characters:
1. **Salviati:** Brilliant defender of Copernicus (Galileo's voice).
2. **Sagredo:** Intelligent layman.
3. **Simplicio:** Stubborn defender of Aristotle/Geocentrism (often looked foolish).

**The Insult:**
Galileo put the Pope's own arguments into the mouth of "Simplicio" (Simpleton). Pope was furious. Felt betrayed and mocked.

## The Trial

### Summoned to Rome

**1633:**
Ailing, 69-year-old Galileo traveled to Rome. Interrogated by Inquisition.

### Charges

**"Vehement Suspicion of Heresy":**
For holding and teaching the Copernican doctrine contrary to 1616 injunction.

### The Proceedings

**Threat of Torture:**
Inquisitors showed him instruments of torture (verbal threat usually sufficient).

**Plea Bargain:**
Galileo admitted he went "too far" in his book (vain ambition), but denied holding heresy.

### Verdict (June 22, 1633)

**Guilty:**
"We pronounce, judge, and declare, that you... have rendered yourself vehemently suspect by this Holy Office of heresy."

**Sentence:**
1.  **Abjuration:** Must formally recant, curse, and detest his errors.
2.  **Imprisonment:** Formal imprisonment at pleasure of Inquisition (commuted to house arrest).
3.  **Book Banned:** *Dialogue* placed on Index of Prohibited Books.

## The Recantation

Galileo knelt before Cardinals and read prepared statement:

> "I abjure, curse and detest the said errors and heresies... and I swear that I will never more in future say, or assert anything... which may give rise to a similar suspicion of me."

### "Eppur si muove"

**Legend:**
It is said that as he rose from his knees, he muttered: *"Eppur si muove"* ("And yet it moves").
(Historical note: Likely apocryphal / thought but not spoken).

---

## Aftermath

### House Arrest (1633-1642)

**Arcetri (Florence):**
Confined to his villa "Il Gioiello." Went blind (1638).

**Final Masterpiece:**
Smuggled manuscript to Holland. *Two New Sciences* (1638) - foundation of modern physics (kinematics). Written while prisoner.

**Death:**
Died 1642. Church refused to let him be buried in family tomb (moved later over century).

---

## Rehabilitation

### Slow Acceptance

- **1758:** Church dropped ban on books teaching heliocentrism.
- **1835:** Galileo's works removed from Index.

### John Paul II (1992)

**Apology:**
After 13-year investigation, Pope John Paul II formally acknowledged Church erred in condemning Galileo. "Tragic mutual incomprehension."

## Legacy

### Scientific Method

Galileo insisted observation/experiment trumps authority.
"The Bible shows the way to go to heaven, not the way the heavens go."

### Symbolism

Archetype of:
- Martyr for science
- Dangers of censorship
- Intellectual freedom
