## Overview

Theranos was the golden child of Silicon Valley. Founded by 19-year-old Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes in 2003, the company promised to revolutionize blood testing with a device (The Edison) that could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood from a finger prick. Valued at $9 billion in 2014, with a board including Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, it was a total fraud. The technology never worked. In October 2015, investigative reporter John Carreyrou exposed the lie. Holmes and her partner Sunny Balwani were convicted of fraud, ending a saga of hubris, deception, and "fake it 'til you make it" culture gone wrong.

## The Vision

### Elizabeth Holmes

**Steve Jobs Worship:**
Wore black turtlenecks. Never took vacation. Deepened voice intentionally.
Charismatic visionary.
"A world where no one has to say goodbye too soon."

### The "Edison"

**Concept:**
Cheap, painless, fast blood tests.
A "nanotainer" (tiny vial) of blood.
Accessible at Walgreens pharmacies.

**Reality:**
The device couldn't handle the tests. Physics problem (capillary blood isn't same as venous; sample too small).
Theranos secretly ran tests on commercial Siemens machines (hacking them to work with small samples, often diluting them, producing wrong results).

---

## The Deception

### Secrecy

"Trade secrets" used as excuse for no peer review.
Employees siloed.
Intimidation tactics/NDAs.

### The Board

Recruited "old men" with reputation but no medical knowledge:
- George Shultz (Sec of State)
- Henry Kissinger
- James Mattis (General)
- Rupert Murdoch (Invested $125 million)

They gave credibility.

### Sunny Balwani

COO and Holmes' secret boyfriend. Enforcer. Created culture of fear.

## The Unraveling

### John Carreyrou (WSJ)

**Tip:**
Received tip from medical expert that Theranos results were suspicious.
Contacted whistleblowers (Tyler Shultz, Erika Cheung).

**Article (Oct 15, 2015):**
"Hot Startup Theranos Has Struggle With Its Blood-Test Technology."
Revealed they weren't using their own machines.

**Holmes' Response:**
Went on Jim Cramer's *Mad Money*:
> "This is what happens when you work to change things. First they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world."

### Collapse

- regulators (CMS) inspected labs -> banned Holmes.
- Walgreens terminated partnership.
- Lawsuits piled up.
- Valuation: $9 billion -> $0.

## The Trial (2021-2022)

**Defense:**
Blamed Sunny Balwani (abuse). Blamed "failure" not "fraud".

**Verdict (Jan 2022):**
Guilty on 4 counts of defrauding investors.

**Sentence:**
11.25 years in prison. Reported to prison May 2023.

## Legacy

### Silicon Valley Culture

Exposed the danger of "move fast and break things" when applied to healthcare.
Investors became more skeptical of "black box" technology.

### Whistleblowers

Erika Cheung and Tyler Shultz (grandson of board member George Shultz) heroes.
