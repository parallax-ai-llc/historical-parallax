## Summary

Novak Djokovic, born May 22, 1987, in Belgrade, Serbia, is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players in history. With 24 Grand Slam singles titles—the most in men's tennis history—Djokovic has spent a record 428 weeks as world No. 1 and has dominated the sport across all surfaces for over 15 years.[^1][^2] His remarkable achievements include a record 10 Australian Open titles, a Career Golden Slam completed at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and the distinction of being the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam.[^3][^4] Despite his on-court brilliance and philanthropic efforts, Djokovic's career has been marked by significant controversies, including his 2022 deportation from Australia over COVID-19 vaccination status and his embrace of alternative medicine and pseudoscientific beliefs.[^5][^6]

---

## Early Life and Background

Novak Djokovic was born on May 22, 1987, in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to parents Dijana (née Žagar) and Srdjan Djokovic.[^7] He is of paternal Serbian and maternal Croatian descent, and has two younger brothers, Marko and Djordje, who both pursued professional tennis careers.[^8] His parents ran a family business that included a tennis academy and three restaurants, which provided crucial support for their son's athletic development despite challenging economic circumstances.[^9]

Djokovic's childhood unfolded during one of the most turbulent periods in Serbian history. Growing up in war-torn Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s presented extraordinary hardships.[^10] Despite the economic turmoil and NATO bombing campaigns that forced the young Djokovic to take shelter in basements, his passion for tennis never wavered.[^11] He began playing tennis at age four after his parents gave him a mini-racket and a soft foam ball, sparking his lifelong passion for the sport.[^12]

In the summer of 1993, as a six-year-old, Djokovic met Jelena Genčić at a tennis camp she was overseeing at Mount Kopaonik, where his parents ran a fast-food parlor.[^13] Genčić, who had previously worked with Monica Seles, recognized the young boy's extraordinary potential and worked with him over the following six years.[^14] She convinced Djokovic to hit his backhand with two hands instead of the single hand used by his idol, Pete Sampras, and Djokovic has credited Genčić for "shaping my mind as a human being, but also as a professional."[^15]

At age 12, Djokovic attended the Nikola Pilić Academy in Munich, Germany, where he trained for almost two years before returning to Belgrade.[^16] Despite the hardships of growing up during wartime, he became Europe's top-ranked 14-and-under player and later the number one 16-and-under player on the continent before turning professional in 2003.[^17]

---

## Rise to Prominence

Djokovic played in his first professional tournament at age 15 and won his first ATP Challenger tournament a year later in May 2004.[^18] His rapid ascent through professional tennis demonstrated the exceptional talent that Genčić had identified years earlier. In July 2006, he claimed his first ATP Tour title at the Dutch Open without losing a set, announcing his arrival on the international stage.[^19]

The Serbian's breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came at the 2007 US Open, where he reached his first major final, eventually losing to Roger Federer.[^20] However, this setback proved temporary. In January 2008, Djokovic claimed his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets to become the first Serbian player to win a major singles title.[^21] At 20 years old, he had arrived as a legitimate threat to the dominance of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

The period from 2008 to 2010 saw Djokovic establish himself as a consistent top-three player, but he struggled to break through the Federer-Nadal duopoly that had dominated men's tennis.[^22] This changed dramatically in 2011, when Djokovic experienced one of the most dominant seasons in tennis history. He compiled a 43-match winning streak to start the year, won three Grand Slam titles (Australian Open, Wimbledon, and US Open), and ascended to world No. 1 for the first time.[^23]

A crucial factor in Djokovic's transformation was a dramatic change in his diet and physical condition. In 2010, he met with Dr. Igor Cetojevic, a nutritionist who diagnosed him with gluten and dairy sensitivity through kinesiological arm testing.[^24] After adopting a strict gluten-free diet for two weeks, Djokovic experienced immediate results—better sleep, more energy, and improved agility on court.[^25] By the end of 2011, he had won three of the four Grand Slams and established himself as the world's best player.[^26]

## Major Achievements and Records

Novak Djokovic's career achievements represent an unprecedented level of dominance in professional tennis. He holds the men's all-time record with 24 Grand Slam singles titles and is the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam by winning each of the four majors at least three times.[^27][^28]

### Grand Slam Titles by Tournament

**Australian Open**: Djokovic has won a record 10 Australian Open titles (2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023), establishing Melbourne Park as his most dominant venue.[^29] His supremacy at the Australian Open is unmatched in tennis history.

**Wimbledon**: With seven Wimbledon titles, Djokovic is tied with Pete Sampras for second-most in tournament history, behind only Roger Federer's eight.[^30]

**US Open**: Djokovic has won four US Open titles, demonstrating his excellence on hard courts across multiple continents.[^31]

**French Open**: He has claimed three French Open titles, with his 2016 victory completing the career Grand Slam and enabling him to hold all four major titles simultaneously—the "Nole Slam."[^32] This historic achievement made Djokovic the eighth player to achieve a Career Grand Slam and only the third after Don Budge and Rod Laver to hold all four major titles at once.[^33]

### ATP Tour and Masters Records

Beyond Grand Slams, Djokovic has won 101 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including a record 40 Masters titles and a record seven year-end championships.[^34] He is the first and only player to achieve the Career Golden Masters by winning titles across all nine Masters 1000 tournaments, a feat he has accomplished twice.[^35][^36]

### Ranking Records

Djokovic has been ranked as world No. 1 for a record 428 weeks and finished as year-end No. 1 a record eight times.[^37] He has been ranked No. 1 at least once in a year for a record 13 different years and set a rankings points record of 16,950.[^38][^39]

### Olympic Gold Medal

The one title that eluded Djokovic for years was Olympic gold. After bronze at Beijing 2008 and heartbreaking defeats in subsequent Olympics, Djokovic finally captured the elusive gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics.[^40] On August 4, 2024, at age 37, he defeated Carlos Alcaraz 7-6, 7-6 in an epic final at Roland-Garros to complete his Career Golden Slam.[^41][^42] Remarkably, Djokovic became the first man to win Olympic singles gold without dropping a set since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, and the oldest male gold medalist in singles.[^43]

### Longevity and Dominance After 30

Twelve of Djokovic's 24 Grand Slam titles have come since he turned 30, demonstrating remarkable longevity.[^44] His 150th win at a major after turning 30 made him the first man to hit that landmark, with only Serena Williams (159) having achieved it.[^45]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his extraordinary achievements, Djokovic's career has been shadowed by numerous controversies that have affected his public image and legacy.

### COVID-19 and the Australian Open Deportation (2022)

The most significant controversy of Djokovic's career occurred in January 2022 when he traveled to Australia to compete in the Australian Open with a medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination requirements.[^46] Court documents revealed he had been granted the exemption after testing positive for COVID-19 in December 2021.[^47] However, upon arrival in Melbourne on January 5, Djokovic was denied entry and detained at the airport for nine hours.[^48]

The Australian Border Force cancelled his visa, stating that Djokovic "failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia."[^49] Prime Minister Scott Morrison tweeted: "Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders. No one is above these rules."[^50] The controversy intensified when images emerged showing Djokovic attending public events without a mask on December 16—the same date his court documents showed he tested positive for COVID-19.[^51]

After a legal battle, Immigration Minister Alex Hawke cancelled Djokovic's visa on the grounds that he was considered a "talisman of a community of anti-vaccination sentiment."[^52] Djokovic left Australia on January 16, 2022, after losing his final appeal to avoid deportation, missing the tournament he had won nine times previously.[^53]

### The Adria Tour Controversy (2020)

In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Djokovic organized the Adria Tour, an exhibition tennis event held in Belgrade, Serbia, and Zadar, Croatia.[^54] The event fell under heavy criticism for its lack of social distancing procedures and for allowing full crowds.[^55] Videos surfaced of Djokovic and other players partying at a Serbian nightclub, playing basketball, and dancing together without masks or social distancing.[^56]

On June 21, 2020, Bulgarian player Grigor Dimitrov tested positive for COVID-19 after participating in the Zadar event, forcing cancellation of the final.[^57] Subsequently, Borna Ćorić, Viktor Troicki and his pregnant wife, and both Djokovic and his wife Jelena all tested positive.[^58] Djokovic issued an apology, stating "We were wrong and it was too soon. I can't express enough how sorry I am for this and every case of infection."[^59] Australian player Nick Kyrgios labeled it a "boneheaded decision."[^60]

### On-Court Behavior and Temper Tantrums

Djokovic has faced repeated criticism for his on-court behavior, including racket smashing and angry outbursts. His most infamous incident occurred at the 2020 US Open when he struck a line judge in the throat with a tennis ball hit in anger after losing a game, resulting in disqualification from the tournament.[^61]

At the 2021 Tokyo Olympics bronze medal match, Djokovic threw his racket into the stands and later aggressively smashed his racket at the net while trailing.[^62] Similar incidents have occurred throughout his career, including during his 2023 Wimbledon final loss to Carlos Alcaraz, where he smashed his racket in front of his children.[^63][^64]

Djokovic has expressed remorse about these incidents, admitting in conversation with Nick Kyrgios that breaking rackets and reacting angrily makes him "ashamed" and causes him to "really hate" himself.[^65] He stated, "Honestly, I regret when I break a racquet on the court...we are all humans, we all make mistakes."[^66]

### Pseudoscience and Alternative Medicine

Djokovic has embraced numerous alternative medicine practices and pseudoscientific beliefs that have drawn criticism from the scientific community.[^67] His gluten intolerance was diagnosed through "kinesiological arm testing" by Dr. Igor Cetojevic, who pressed bread against his stomach while testing his arm strength—a method not scientifically validated.[^68]

He has endorsed the TaoPatch device, which manufacturers claim uses nanotechnology to "convert natural body heat into microscopic beams of light to stimulate the nervous system," though scientific evidence for its efficacy is lacking.[^69] In discussions with wellness guru Chervin Jafarieh, Djokovic claimed people can "turn the most toxic food or the most polluted water, into the most healing water" through prayer and gratitude.[^70]

Djokovic has also endorsed Anthony William, the self-anointed "Medical Medium" who claims to receive medical advice from spirits, and made pilgrimages to the Pyramid of the Sun in Visoko, Bosnia, which is said to have mystical healing powers.[^71][^72] In 2017, he vehemently opposed undergoing elbow surgery, insisting a cure could be found through holistic medicine, and reportedly cried for three days after eventually having the operation.[^73]

---

## Personal Life

Novak Djokovic married Jelena Djokovic (née Ristic) in July 2014 after being together for eight years.[^74] The couple met as teenagers in Serbia and began dating in 2005 when Djokovic was 18 years old, while both were attending a tennis academy.[^75] They were married at a seaside resort on Sveti Stefan Island in Montenegro.[^76]

Jelena Djokovic is a Serbian humanitarian and businesswoman who serves as the global CEO of the Novak Djokovic Foundation, a charity she co-founded with her husband.[^77] She has built her own identity with nearly 1 million social media followers and is considered one of the most prominent tennis spouses.[^78] The couple has two children: Stefan, born in October 2014, and Tara, born in September 2017.[^79]

Djokovic's personality extends beyond the tennis court. He is known for his exceptional defensive skills, mental resilience, and flexibility, which have contributed to his ability to compete at the highest level well into his late thirties.[^80] His daily routine begins at 7:00 AM after eight hours of sleep, starting with meditation and yoga involving stretches, movements, and conscious breathing in a 20-minute session.[^81] He has emphasized that conscious breathing is "probably the one ingredient that is the most important" to his success.[^82]

His diet remains strictly gluten-free and dairy-free while limiting sugar intake, primarily based on vegetables, beans, white meat, fish, fruit, nuts, seeds, chickpeas, lentils, and healthy oils.[^83] Djokovic begins each day with a glass of warm water with lemon to detoxify his body and kickstart his metabolism.[^84]

## Philanthropic Work and Foundation

In 2007, Djokovic founded the Novak Djokovic Foundation with the goal of helping children from disadvantaged communities grow up and develop in stimulating and safe environments.[^85] The charity focuses on achieving equal access to early childhood education, a cause that resonates deeply with Djokovic given his own challenging childhood during the Yugoslav Wars.[^86]

The foundation partnered with the World Bank in August 2015 to promote early childhood education in Serbia and has built 50 schools as of April 2022 while supporting more than 20,800 children and over a thousand families.[^87] Djokovic was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2015 in recognition of his humanitarian efforts.[^88]

During the 2014 Balkans floods, Djokovic sparked worldwide financial and media support for victims. After winning the 2014 Rome Masters, he donated his prize money to flood victims in Serbia, while his foundation collected another $600,000.[^89] After the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, he and his wife announced they would donate €1 million for the purchase of ventilators and medical equipment, and also made donations to Bergamo, Italy, Novi Pazar, Serbia, and North Mitrovica, Kosovo.[^90]

---

## Coaching Relationships and Team

Throughout his career, Djokovic has worked with several notable coaches. His longest coaching relationship was with Marian Vajda, who worked with him from 2006 to 2017 and again from 2018 to 2022.[^91] In June 2019, Djokovic added former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanišević to his coaching team, initially working alongside Vajda.[^92] After Vajda's departure in March 2022, Ivanišević became head coach.[^93]

The partnership with Ivanišević lasted until March 27, 2024, during which Djokovic won nine major titles.[^94] Ivanišević described working with Djokovic as challenging: "He's not an easy guy, let's put it this way. Especially when something's not going his way. But we are here to put our back in and to get beaten. That's what the team is for."[^95]

In 2025, Djokovic announced that former rival Andy Murray would join his coaching team, a surprising development given their competitive history.[^96] However, it was announced in May 2025 that Murray would no longer be working as Djokovic's coach.[^97]

Djokovic's support team has also included fitness trainers Marco Panichi and Claudio Zimaglia, physiotherapist Ulises Badio, and various hitting partners who have contributed to his sustained excellence.[^98]

## Legacy and Historical Significance

Novak Djokovic's legacy in tennis is defined by statistical dominance that surpasses all other players in the sport's history. With 24 Grand Slam titles, he stands alone at the summit of men's tennis achievement.[^99] His ability to win across all surfaces—10 Australian Opens on hard court, 7 Wimbledons on grass, and 3 French Opens on clay—demonstrates unprecedented versatility.[^100]

Djokovic is the only player in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces and the only player to have won all of the "Big Titles" over the course of his career.[^101] His completion of the Career Golden Slam at the 2024 Paris Olympics made him the only tennis player ever to win all four Grand Slams, Olympic gold, the ATP Finals, and all nine Masters 1000 events at least once.[^102]

Beyond statistics, Djokovic's impact on tennis includes revolutionizing baseline defense and return of serve, demonstrating that exceptional flexibility and court coverage could neutralize powerful servers and aggressive baseliners.[^103] His mental resilience in pressure situations has become legendary, with countless comeback victories from seemingly impossible positions.[^104]

However, Djokovic's legacy is complicated by the controversies that have marked his career. His stance on COVID-19 vaccination, the Adria Tour incident, and embrace of pseudoscience have damaged his public image, particularly in Western markets.[^105] Unlike Roger Federer's elegance and Rafael Nadal's gracious sportsmanship, Djokovic has often struggled with public perception despite his superior statistical achievements.[^106]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

From a purely statistical perspective, Djokovic's claim as the greatest tennis player of all time is compelling. Rafael Nadal himself acknowledged this, stating: "The numbers show he's the best, which means his tennis has also been the best."[^107] Of 30 major statistical categories comparing the "Big Three," Djokovic leads in a staggering 27.[^108]

Tennis analysts and former players have praised Djokovic's completeness as a player. Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker, who coached Djokovic from 2014 to 2016, explained the nuanced debate: "Djokovic is the most successful, Federer the most popular, and Nadal the most feared."[^109] This assessment acknowledges Djokovic's statistical supremacy while recognizing the multifaceted nature of tennis legacy.

Djokovic's longevity and sustained excellence into his late thirties have earned admiration from the tennis community. His ability to win 12 Grand Slam titles after turning 30 demonstrates dedication, physical conditioning, and adaptation that few athletes in any sport have matched.[^110] His philanthropic work through the Novak Djokovic Foundation, supporting early childhood education for over 20,800 children, represents a significant positive legacy beyond tennis.[^111]

### Negative Views and Criticisms

Despite his statistical dominance, Djokovic faces criticism on multiple fronts. His resistance to COVID-19 vaccination and the resulting deportation from Australia alienated many fans and commentators.[^112] Critics viewed his stance as privileged entitlement and a dangerous public health message during a global pandemic.[^113]

The scientific community has criticized Djokovic's promotion of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. An article in *Skeptical Inquirer* titled "Novak Djokovic and the Pseudoscience Grand Slam" detailed his endorsement of unproven treatments and beliefs.[^114] Medical professionals worry that his celebrity status gives credibility to scientifically unfounded practices, potentially influencing public health decisions.[^115]

Djokovic's on-court behavior, including racket smashing and the 2020 US Open disqualification, has drawn criticism for setting a poor example for young players.[^116] Some commentators argue that his temper tantrums reveal character flaws inconsistent with true sportsmanship.[^117]

Regarding his place in tennis history, some argue that popularity and cultural impact should factor into GOAT discussions alongside statistics.[^118] Roger Federer's global popularity and elegant playing style created millions of new tennis fans worldwide, while Nadal's graciousness and humility made him universally beloved.[^119] Djokovic, despite superior numbers, has never achieved comparable public affection, leading some to question whether raw statistics alone should determine greatness.[^120]

## Rivalries and Head-to-Head Records

Djokovic's career has been defined by his rivalries with the other members of the "Big Three" (Federer and Nadal) and the "Big Four" (adding Andy Murray).

### Djokovic vs. Nadal

The Djokovic-Nadal rivalry is the most prolific in men's tennis history, with 60 meetings across all surfaces.[^121] Djokovic leads 31-29 overall and 15-13 in finals.[^122] At Grand Slam tournaments, Nadal leads 11-7, including 5-4 in major finals.[^123] Their contrasting styles—Nadal's heavy topspin and physical intensity versus Djokovic's defensive flexibility and counter-punching—produced some of the greatest matches in tennis history, including the 2012 Australian Open final that lasted 5 hours and 53 minutes.[^124]

### Djokovic vs. Federer

Djokovic and Federer faced each other 50 times, with Djokovic leading 27-23 overall, including 13-6 in finals.[^125] At Grand Slams, they played 17 matches with Djokovic leading 11-6, including a record eleven semifinals.[^126] Their rivalry represented a generational shift, with Djokovic eventually surpassing his childhood idol to dominate the latter stages of their head-to-head meetings.[^127]

### Djokovic vs. Murray

Djokovic and Murray met 36 times, with Djokovic leading 25-11 overall and 11-8 in finals.[^128] Of their ten Grand Slam encounters, Djokovic leads 8-2.[^129] The two grew up together as juniors and maintained a friendship even as their rivalry intensified.[^130] Murray's hiring as Djokovic's coach in 2025, though brief, represented a remarkable evolution of their relationship.[^131]

Djokovic currently holds a winning head-to-head record against all members of the Big Four, a unique distinction that underscores his competitive dominance.[^132]

— Reflecting on his childhood ambitions and unlikely rise to the top of tennis
