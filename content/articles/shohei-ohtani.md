## Summary

Shohei Ohtani is a Japanese professional baseball designated hitter and pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB), born on July 5, 1994, in Oshu, Japan.[^1] Nicknamed "Shotime," he has established himself as the sport's greatest two-way player in a century following his MLB debut in 2018.[^2] Ohtani has won four MVP awards, becoming the first player to win MVP awards in both the American and National Leagues, and the first player to win multiple MVP awards by unanimous vote.[^3] His historic 2024 season saw him become the first player in MLB history to achieve a 50-50 season with 54 home runs and 59 stolen bases, culminating in a World Series championship with the Dodgers.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Shohei Ohtani was born on July 5, 1994, in Oshu, Japan (formerly known as Mizusawa City in Iwate Prefecture), into a family deeply connected to sports.[^5] His father, Toru, was a former amateur baseball player who worked at a Mitsubishi production plant, while his mother, Kayoko, was a prominent Japanese badminton player who excelled at the amateur level.[^6] Ohtani grew up with two older siblings: a sister named Yuka and a brother named Ryuta, who also played amateur baseball at the industrial league level in Japan.[^7]

From an early age, Ohtani was immersed in baseball culture. His father introduced both Shohei and Ryuta to the sport at a young age, playing catch with them for hours after returning from his job at the automobile factory.[^8] Coached by his father, Ohtani displayed an extraordinary aptitude for the game from childhood. He began playing organized baseball in his second year of elementary school, and by seventh grade, he recorded all but one of 18 outs in a six-inning regional championship game, showcasing his dominance even at a young age.[^9]

Beyond baseball, Ohtani participated in various sports during his childhood, including badminton and swimming, demonstrating his natural athleticism.[^10] His high school baseball coach, Hiroshi Sasaki, noted that Ohtani was such a fast swimmer he could have potentially competed in the Olympics.[^11] However, baseball remained his primary passion. In Japan, Ohtani was known as a "yakyū shōnen" (野球少年; "baseball boy")—a kid who lived, ate, and breathed baseball.[^12]

For high school, Ohtani opted to stay local, selecting Hanamaki Higashi High School in Iwate Prefecture, Northern Japan—the same institution attended by pitcher Yusei Kikuchi, whom he admired.[^13] By the time he entered high school, Ohtani had already become one of the hardest-throwing teen pitchers in Japan. At age 17, his fastball velocity reached a remarkable 99 miles per hour (159 km/h), placing him among the elite young prospects in Japanese baseball.[^14] His exceptional performance and physical tools attracted attention from both Japanese professional teams and Major League Baseball scouts, setting the stage for his extraordinary career.

## Rise to Prominence

### Nippon Professional Baseball Career (2013-2017)

Despite Ohtani's insistence that he wanted to join MLB immediately after high school, he was selected by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters as the first overall pick in the 2012 NPB draft.[^15] During meetings with franchise officials, Ohtani was persuaded to sign after they promised that he could both pitch and hit for the Fighters—a commitment that would prove crucial to his development as a two-way player.[^16] This decision marked the beginning of his professional career and allowed him to refine his unique skill set in a supportive environment.

Ohtani made his NPB debut at age 18 in the Fighters' season-opening game on March 29, 2013, playing as a right fielder.[^17] His rookie season provided valuable experience as he adjusted to professional baseball. However, it was in 2014 that Ohtani truly announced his arrival as a generational talent. He won his first 10 games on August 26 and hit his 10th home run on September 7, becoming the first player in NPB history to achieve double-digit wins and double-digit home runs in the same season.[^18] He eventually pitched in 24 games, going 11-4 with a 2.61 ERA, while as a hitter, he appeared in 86 games, batting .274 with 10 home runs and 31 RBIs.[^19]

The following year, in 2015, Ohtani led the NPB with a 2.24 ERA, establishing himself as one of the league's premier pitchers.[^20] His best NPB season came in 2016 when he posted the best ERA in the league (1.86) and was named Pacific League Most Valuable Player, helping lead the Fighters to both the Pacific League and Japan Series championships.[^21] Over his five-year career with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters from 2013 through 2017, Ohtani compiled an impressive record of 42 wins and 15 losses with a 2.52 ERA in 85 pitching appearances, while also demonstrating consistent excellence as a position player.[^22]

### MLB Debut and Rookie Season (2018)

Ohtani signed with the Los Angeles Angels on December 9, 2017, receiving a $2.315 million signing bonus.[^23] Because he was under 25 years old, Ohtani was subjected to international signing rules, which capped his bonus and limited him to a rookie salary scale—a restriction that would later make his early MLB achievements all the more remarkable from a value perspective.[^24]

His debut season exceeded all expectations. Ohtani started as the designated hitter on Opening Day, March 29, 2018, against the Oakland Athletics, singling in his first at-bat.[^25] On April 1, he made his pitching debut, striking out six batters in six innings while allowing three runs to pick up his first MLB win.[^26] Just two days later, on April 3, Ohtani hit his first MLB home run—a 397-foot three-run blast that signaled his arrival as a legitimate power threat.[^27]

The 2018 season established Ohtani as a unique phenomenon in modern baseball. He ended his first major league campaign with a batting average of .285, a .361 on-base percentage, 22 home runs, 61 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases.[^28] On the mound, in 10 starts, he notched a 4–2 record with a 3.31 ERA, 1.16 WHIP, and 63 strikeouts.[^29] His dual excellence led him to join Babe Ruth as the only MLB players with 10 pitching appearances and 20 home runs in a season.[^30] On November 12, Ohtani was named the American League Rookie of the Year, receiving 137 points in the balloting process, including 25 of 30 first-place votes.[^31]

However, the season ended on a concerning note. On September 3, it was revealed that Ohtani would undergo Tommy John surgery after an MRI showed new damage to his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL).[^32] He underwent the surgery on October 1, beginning what would be the first of multiple rehabilitation periods that would test his resilience and determination to continue as a two-way player.[^33]

## Major Achievements

### Angels Era (2018-2023)

Following his Tommy John surgery, Ohtani's 2019 and 2020 seasons were marked by rehabilitation and adjustment. He returned to pitching in 2020 but struggled to regain his form immediately. However, 2021 marked Ohtani's emergence as a transcendent talent and one of baseball's all-time greats.

The 2021 season represents one of the greatest individual performances in baseball history. Ohtani hit 46 home runs and struck out 156 batters en route to winning his first AL Most Valuable Player Award unanimously.[^34] He became the first player in major league history to be named an All-Star as both a pitcher and a position player.[^35] His season batting line and pitching statistics demonstrated elite performance in both roles: he finished the year with 46 home runs and a 158 OPS+ as a hitter while posting a 3.18 ERA on the mound.[^36] In 2022, Ohtani became the first modern-era player to qualify for both hitting and pitching leaderboards in the same season, finishing third in the AL with 219 strikeouts and leading the league with an 11.87 K/9 innings rate.[^37]

His 2023 campaign was equally remarkable despite the Angels' struggles as a team. Ohtani finished as the AL leader in home runs (44), on-base percentage (.412), and total bases (325), while also leading MLB in slugging (.654) and on-base plus slugging (1.066).[^38] As a pitcher, he went 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA, limiting batters to a .184 average.[^39] His fastball averaged 96.7 MPH and topped 98 MPH with 110 of 396 fastballs, including seven pitches at 100+ MPH.[^40] He recorded 167 strikeouts in 23 starts (132 innings), with 57 of 63 (90.5%) strikeouts on a swinging strike three—the highest rate in the Majors.[^41]

### World Baseball Classic Triumph (2023)

Before joining the Dodgers, Ohtani achieved one of his most memorable moments representing Japan in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Japan defeated the United States 3–2 to earn a record-extending third World Baseball Classic title on March 21, 2023, at LoanDepot Park in Miami.[^42] Ohtani earned the save in the championship game after pitching the final inning, striking out then-teammate Mike Trout with a 3–2 slider to clinch Japan's WBC championship.[^43] This iconic ending duel between team captains and Los Angeles Angels teammates was considered one of the greatest moments in the history of the sport.[^44]

Ohtani won the tournament's Most Valuable Player award after an outstanding performance, batting .435 with a 1.86 ERA.[^45] He became the first player to be named to the All-WBC team at two separate positions, having been selected as both a designated hitter and a pitcher.[^46] The championship game attracted an average television viewership of 5.2 million people in the U.S. and a reported 62 million viewers in Japan, representing 42.4% of households in the country.[^47]

### Historic Dodgers Season (2024)

After signing a groundbreaking 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers—with $680 million in salary deferred—Ohtani joined one of baseball's most storied franchises.[^48] The unprecedented contract structure, with 97% of the total value deferred until 2034-2043, was Ohtani's own idea to give the Dodgers payroll flexibility to build a championship team.[^49]

His first season with the Dodgers in 2024 will be remembered as one of the greatest individual campaigns in baseball history. Ohtani slashed .310/.390/.646 in 159 games, establishing career-high marks in each category, along with career highs in hits (197), doubles (38), home runs (54), RBIs (130), and stolen bases (59).[^50] On September 19, Ohtani achieved a feat that had never been accomplished: a 50-50 season, finishing with 54 home runs and 59 stolen bases.[^51] He became the first player in MLB history to have at least 45 homers, 25 stolen bases, 100 RBIs, 100 runs, and eight triples in a season.[^52]

For this historic performance, Ohtani was unanimously named the 2024 National League MVP, becoming the first player to win MVP awards in both MLB leagues.[^53] The Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in five games in the World Series, giving Ohtani his first career championship in his first MLB postseason appearance.[^54] While his World Series performance was subdued due to a shoulder injury suffered in Game 2—he had only two hits in 19 at-bats—the team's success fulfilled his championship aspirations.[^55] After the season, it was revealed that the injury he suffered was actually a torn labrum in his left shoulder, for which he underwent surgery.[^56]

### Career Statistics and Records

Through his career, Ohtani has accumulated remarkable statistics on both sides of the ball. As a hitter, he maintains a .282 batting average with 1,050 hits, 280 home runs, 669 RBIs, and 708 runs scored.[^57] As a pitcher, he has recorded 670 strikeouts in 100 MLB appearances, with an overall strong ERA and strikeout rates that rival the game's best pitchers.[^58]

Ohtani has won four MVP awards, four Silver Slugger awards, one League Championship MVP award, the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, and the Edgar Martinez Award.[^59] He matched Joe Morgan as the only players to win back-to-back MVPs while also winning consecutive World Series titles.[^60] His accomplishments have drawn comparisons to Babe Ruth, with some analysts arguing that Ohtani's sustained two-way excellence over multiple seasons surpasses even Ruth's brief two-way period from 1918-1919.[^61]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Gambling Scandal (2024)

The most significant controversy in Ohtani's career emerged in March 2024 when his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, became embroiled in a massive gambling scandal. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud on June 4 after admitting to stealing more than $16 million from Ohtani to finance illegal sports betting.[^62] The scandal shocked the baseball world and initially raised questions about Ohtani's potential involvement.

Federal investigators determined that Mizuhara had siphoned millions from Ohtani's bank account, to which he had direct access, and between December 2021 and January 2024, allegedly lost more than $40 million across approximately 19,000 individual bets.[^63] Mizuhara even impersonated Ohtani in phone calls to the bank to facilitate the transfers.[^64] On October 25, 2024, Mizuhara was sentenced to nearly five years in prison (four years and nine months) and ordered to pay restitution of $18 million, including nearly $17 million to Ohtani.[^65]

Ohtani consistently denied that he had placed any bets or had any knowledge of Mizuhara's gambling activities.[^66] Prosecutors confirmed that Ohtani was a victim and was not aware of the gambling or the wire transfers from his bank account.[^67] Despite his exoneration by federal authorities, the scandal became one of the biggest sports gambling controversies in decades and briefly cast a shadow over Ohtani's otherwise pristine public image.[^68]

### Other Controversies

In late 2024, another controversy emerged when two Hawaiian real estate developers filed a lawsuit against Ohtani and his agent, though details of the case remain limited.[^69] Additionally, some baseball traditionalists have questioned whether Ohtani's deferred contract structure provides an unfair competitive advantage to the Dodgers by artificially reducing their luxury tax burden, though this criticism is directed more at MLB's financial rules than at Ohtani personally.[^70]

### Performance Criticisms

While Ohtani's regular season performances have been universally celebrated, some critics pointed to his struggles in the 2024 World Series, where he batted just .105 (2-for-19) with no RBIs.[^71] However, this criticism was significantly mitigated by the revelation that he played through a torn shoulder labrum, demonstrating his commitment to his team despite the injury.[^72]

Some baseball analysts have also questioned the long-term sustainability of the two-way role, particularly given Ohtani's two Tommy John surgeries on his throwing elbow.[^73] He underwent his first Tommy John surgery in 2018 and his second—a revision procedure with an internal brace—in September 2023.[^74] Concerns persist about whether Ohtani can maintain his two-way excellence as he ages, with some suggesting he may eventually need to focus exclusively on hitting to preserve his health and career longevity.[^75]

## Personal Life

### Marriage and Family

Ohtani announced in February 2024 that he had married, initially declining to disclose his wife's identity except to say, "She's a normal Japanese woman."[^76] His wife was later revealed to be Mamiko Tanaka, a former professional basketball player who played at Waseda University before joining Japan's Women's Basketball League with the Fujitsu Red Wave in 2019.[^77] On December 28, 2024, Ohtani and Tanaka announced the birth of their first child, a daughter, with Ohtani writing in an Instagram post: "I am so grateful to my loving wife who gave birth to our healthy beautiful daughter."[^78]

Ohtani's parents, Toru and Kayoko Ohtani, gave birth to Shohei on July 5, 1994, in Oshu, Japan.[^79] His mother excelled in badminton during her youth and played at an amateur level, while his father played as an outfielder for a corporate-sponsored baseball team before stopping due to a shoulder injury at age 25 and working full-time at a local automobile factory.[^80] Ohtani's older brother Ryuta is also involved in amateur baseball at the industrial league level in Japan, continuing the family's baseball tradition.[^81]

### Lifestyle and Personality

Ohtani has a Kooikerhondje dog named Dekopin, also known as Decoy, who has become somewhat of a celebrity among baseball fans.[^82] Known for his disciplined lifestyle, Ohtani tended to keep to the team dormitory and the gym during his Angels tenure, leading a semi-monastic, baseball-centric existence—a byproduct of holding down two jobs in the big leagues.[^83]

Standing 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) tall and weighing 210 pounds (95 kg), Ohtani possesses the physical attributes ideal for both pitching and hitting at the highest level.[^84] His imposing stature combined with exceptional athleticism allows him to generate elite fastball velocity (consistently 97+ MPH with a career high of 101.7 MPH) while also producing tremendous power at the plate.[^85]

Despite his global superstar status, Ohtani is known for his humility and focus. He has expressed a philosophy of continuous improvement, stating, "I think it's wasteful to limit myself without any reason by saying, 'it's my limit'," and "I still consider myself far from a complete player, with so many things I must work on."[^86] On handling the immense pressure of expectations, Ohtani has said: "It's actually an honor to feel the pressure because that means there's a lot of expectations and I just change that to more of a positive."[^87]

### Business and Endorsements

Ohtani's marketability transcends baseball. He is on track to earn $100 million annually through endorsements, merchandise, and licensing—ten times what any other MLB player earns off the field.[^88] He has more than 20 brand partners divided almost evenly between companies headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, though almost all brands use him globally.[^89]

His biggest endorsement deal is with New Balance, structured more like a global NBA superstar shoe deal than anything previously seen in baseball.[^90] Other major sponsors include Seiko (for which he serves as the global face), Beats, Epic Games (making him the first MLB player included in Fortnite), Fanatics/Topps, Ito En, Kowa, Kosé, Panasonic, and Rapsodo.[^91] For comparison, Bryce Harper, one of baseball's most recognizable names, is second to Ohtani in endorsements at just $10 million annually.[^92]

## Legacy

### Impact on Baseball

Ohtani's prime seasons have been considered among the greatest in baseball history, with some comparing them favorably to the early career of Babe Ruth.[^93] He has inspired a new generation of athletes to pursue two-way play, challenging conventional norms and expanding the possibilities within the sport.[^94] His MVP-caliber seasons have proven that with modern training regimens and strategic game planning, the legacy of two-way players can be sustained and even celebrated anew.[^95]

Ohtani's success has prompted teams to reassess the development and utilization of versatile players.[^96] His achievements challenge traditional sports roles, inspiring teams to reconsider player development strategies and demonstrating the potential for versatility in the game.[^97] The willingness of the Angels and later the Dodgers to support his two-way ambitions has created a new paradigm in baseball operations.

### Cultural Impact

Ohtani's popularity transcends baseball, particularly in Japan, where he has achieved pop-culture status comparable to Michael Jordan's influence in the United States.[^98] In Tokyo, his image appears on flashing billboards overlooking Shibuya crossing, in life-size cardboard cutouts inside convenience stores, emblazoned on vending machines, and on bottles of tea.[^99] Dodgers president Andrew Friedman observed that "Shohei's impact in Japan is impossible to overstate," adding, "We thought we understood it, but until you see it and live it, you can't fully grasp it."[^100]

The 2024 World Series drew more than a tenth of Japan's population, giving it better TV ratings in Japan than in the United States.[^101] The Dodgers' Game 2 victory drew an average of 15.9 million viewers, marking the highest-rated Major League Baseball postseason game in Japan's history.[^102] Viewership is rising both in the United States and abroad thanks in large part to Ohtani, with MLB ratings in Japan on track for record-setting numbers.[^103]

The popularity of Ohtani and the success of the Dodgers during the 2024 season dramatically popularized American baseball to Japanese audiences while also serving as an important vehicle for U.S.-Japan cultural exchange.[^104] Ohtani and other former NPB players in MLB have transformed baseball into a vehicle of cultural exchange that is breaking the divide between the Japanese and American public.[^105] His dominance in MLB functions as a cultural export rooted in discipline, innovation, and relentless preparation, adding a new, highly visible dimension to Japan's soft power influence.[^106]

Big names like Ohtani have helped revitalize baseball, a sport that has experienced waning popularity in the U.S. for some time.[^107] He is bringing in potentially millions of people who had very little interest in Major League Baseball.[^108] His jersey has become the best-selling in baseball, reflecting his broad appeal across demographics and nationalities.[^109]

### Comparison to Babe Ruth

The comparison between Ohtani and Babe Ruth—the only other player in baseball history to achieve sustained excellence as both a pitcher and hitter—remains a central part of Ohtani's legacy discussion.[^110] However, important distinctions exist between their two-way careers. Ruth was a true two-way player only for a 218-game window in 1918 and 1919, whereas Ohtani has sustained his two-way performance for multiple seasons in the modern era against more talented competition.[^111]

Ruth finished with 501 career pitching strikeouts and 714 home runs.[^112] Ohtani surpassed 507 career strikeouts in just 395 2/3 innings and joined Ruth as the only players in baseball history with 500 strikeouts as a pitcher and 100 home runs as a hitter.[^113] After 347 career games of hitting and pitching, Ohtani posted a higher slugging percentage than Ruth did at the same point (.552–.541).[^114] Until 2021, no player ever hit 30 homers and made 10 starts on the mound in the same year; Ohtani accomplished this in just 81 games.[^115]

While Ruth is held up as the gold standard of a two-way player, the comparison is complicated by different eras, with Ruth playing primarily in the Dead Ball Era while Ohtani performs in the modern game with integration, international competition, and increased specialization.[^116] Many baseball historians and analysts now argue that Ohtani's sustained two-way excellence represents a greater achievement than Ruth's brief two-way period.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Baseball scholars and analysts have nearly universally praised Ohtani's impact on the sport. His ability to excel at both pitching and hitting at the highest level challenges nearly a century of baseball orthodoxy that held specialization as the only viable path to elite performance. ESPN analyst Jeff Passan has called Ohtani's achievements "the most impressive individual performances in baseball history," while noting that his 2021 and 2024 seasons rank among the greatest ever recorded.[^117]

Ohtani's humility and work ethic have earned praise from teammates, opponents, and coaches. Former Angels manager Joe Maddon described Ohtani as "the most talented player I've ever been around" and praised his dedication to continuous improvement despite already achieving unprecedented success.[^118] Dodgers star Mookie Betts said of Ohtani, "He's the best player I've ever seen. What he does on a daily basis is something I don't think we'll ever see again."[^119]

Baseball historians have positioned Ohtani as potentially the greatest player of his generation and one of the most important figures in baseball history. His success has opened doors for future players to pursue two-way careers and has demonstrated that elite athleticism combined with modern sports science can overcome what were thought to be immutable limitations of human performance.[^120]

From a cultural perspective, scholars have highlighted Ohtani's role in strengthening U.S.-Japan relations and promoting baseball globally. His success represents the culmination of Japanese baseball development and has inspired youth participation in baseball across Asia and beyond.[^121] The respect and admiration Ohtani commands transcends sports, making him a genuine ambassador for international cooperation and cultural understanding.

### Negative Views

While criticism of Ohtani is relatively rare compared to the overwhelming praise, some skeptics have questioned whether his two-way role is sustainable long-term, particularly given his injury history with two Tommy John surgeries.[^122] Critics argue that the physical demands of both pitching and hitting at an elite level may ultimately shorten his career or force him to choose one role over the other as he ages into his thirties.

Some baseball traditionalists have expressed concern that Ohtani's unique contract structure with the Dodgers—deferring 97% of his salary—sets a potentially problematic precedent that could allow wealthy teams to circumvent luxury tax restrictions and create competitive imbalances.[^123] This criticism is directed more at MLB's collective bargaining agreement than at Ohtani personally, but it reflects concerns about the broader implications of his unprecedented deal.

A small number of analysts have also pointed to Ohtani's postseason struggles in 2024, when he batted just .105 in the World Series, as evidence that he has not yet proven himself in baseball's highest-pressure situations.[^124] However, this criticism largely evaporated after it was revealed he played through a torn shoulder labrum, and his regular season performance was so dominant that the Dodgers likely would not have reached the World Series without him.

Some have also questioned whether the Angels' organizational incompetence during Ohtani's tenure wasted years of his prime, suggesting that had he been on a competitive team earlier in his career, his legacy and championship credentials would be even more substantial.[^125] This critique reflects poorly on the Angels organization rather than on Ohtani himself, but it does raise counterfactual questions about what his career trajectory might have looked like in a different context.
