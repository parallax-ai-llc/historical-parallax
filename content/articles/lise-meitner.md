## Summary

Lise Meitner was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who was one of those responsible for the discovery of nuclear fission. She provided the first theoretical explanation of nuclear fission together with her nephew Otto Frisch. Despite her crucial role, only her collaborator Otto Hahn received the Nobel Prize for the discovery. Element 109, meitnerium, is named in her honor, and she has been called 'the most significant woman scientist of the 20th century.'
