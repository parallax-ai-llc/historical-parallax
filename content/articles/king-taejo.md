## Summary

Taejo of Goryeo (31 January 877 – 4 July 943), personal name Wang Kŏn, was the founder and first ruler of the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea, which unified and ruled the Korean Peninsula from 918 to 1392 CE[^1][^2]. Born into a powerful maritime merchant family of Goguryeo descent in Songak (modern Kaesong), he rose to power through military prowess and political acumen, ultimately achieving the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms in 936 CE[^3][^4]. His reign established Buddhism as the national religion, implemented innovative governance systems, and laid the foundation for an unprecedented flourishing of Korean culture—his dynasty's name "Goryeo" becoming the origin of the modern English name "Korea"[^5][^6]. Wang Kŏn's legacy as "the only one who unified the divided nation in its whole history" continues to resonate in modern Korea, particularly given the current division between North and South[^7][^8].

## Early Life and Background

Wang Kŏn was born on 31 January 877 in Songak (present-day Kaesong, North Korea) to a wealthy and influential maritime merchant family of Goguryeo descent[^9][^10]. His father, Wang Ryung, was the clan leader who had amassed considerable wealth through lucrative trade with China along the Yeseong River[^11]. Historians believe Wang Kŏn's ancestors were strong leaders who had become wealthy through generations of maritime commerce, living within ancient Goguryeo boundaries, thus making Taejo a Goguryeon by descent[^12][^13]. This heritage would later prove significant in his political ideology and territorial ambitions.

According to some hagiographical accounts, Wang Kŏn's grandfather Chakchegon was allegedly the son of Emperor Suzong of Tang China, though modern encyclopedias dismiss this as legendary embellishment designed to enhance the royal lineage's prestige[^14]. Regardless of such mythological claims, the Wang family's actual economic and political power in the region was substantial and well-documented. The family controlled critical trade routes and had established themselves as influential power brokers in Songak well before Wang Kŏn's birth.

Wang Kŏn came of age during the turbulent Later Three Kingdoms period, a time of profound political instability that followed the collapse of Unified Silla[^15]. The period saw numerous local leaders and bandits rebel against the rule of Queen Jinseong of Silla, who lacked the strong leadership and effective policies needed to address the deteriorating conditions facing the Korean people[^16]. This chaotic environment provided ambitious military leaders with opportunities to carve out their own territories and establish new political orders.

As the eldest son of Wang Ryung, Wang Kŏn received an education befitting his family's status, which would have included training in military arts, classical Chinese literature, Buddhist teachings, and the practical skills of governance and diplomacy[^17]. His upbringing in a merchant family also exposed him to diverse perspectives and cultures through contact with Chinese traders, giving him a cosmopolitan outlook that would later influence his inclusive approach to governance. The combination of wealth, education, military training, and exposure to international trade positioned young Wang Kŏn perfectly for a career in the violent and unpredictable political landscape of early tenth-century Korea.

## Rise to Power

Wang Kŏn's military career began in earnest when he entered the service of Kung Ye (also known as Gung Ye), a former Buddhist monk who had established the kingdom of Taebong (initially called Later Goguryeo) in 901 CE[^18][^19]. Kung Ye quickly recognized Wang Kŏn's exceptional military abilities and promoted him to general, even regarding him as a brother[^20]. In 900 CE, Wang Kŏn led a successful campaign against local clans and Later Baekje's army in the Chungju area, demonstrating the tactical brilliance that would characterize his military career[^21].

As Wang Kŏn's military reputation grew, so did his influence within Kung Ye's court. However, Kung Ye's rule became increasingly tyrannical over time, characterized by paranoid purges, excessive taxation, and erratic behavior that alienated both the common people and the military elite[^22][^23]. The king's descent into despotism created dangerous instability within Taebong and prompted Wang Kŏn's closest military allies to consider drastic action.

On the night of 24 July 918 CE, four top-ranked generals of Taebong—Hong Yu, Pae Hyŏn-gyŏng, Sin Sung-gyŏm, and Pok Chigyŏm—met secretly and agreed to overthrow Kung Ye's rule and crown Wang Kŏn as their new king[^24][^25]. According to historical accounts, Wang Kŏn initially opposed the idea, displaying either genuine reluctance or political shrewdness in not appearing overly ambitious[^26]. However, he ultimately agreed to their plan, and Kung Ye was overthrown in the coup and killed near the capital, Cheorwon[^27][^28].

On the morning of 25 July 918 CE, the generals formally installed Wang Kŏn as the new king[^29]. One of his first acts was to rename the kingdom "Goryeo," deliberately evoking the legacy of the ancient Goguryeo kingdom and signaling his intention to reclaim its former territories[^30][^31]. The next year, in 919 CE, he moved the capital back to his hometown of Gaegyeong (also known as Songak or Kaesong), consolidating his power base in familiar territory where his family's influence was strongest[^32][^33].

This strategic relocation served multiple purposes: it placed the capital in a more defensible location with better access to trade routes, it rewarded Wang Kŏn's home region and loyal supporters, and it symbolically represented a fresh start distinct from Kung Ye's regime. The establishment of Goryeo under Wang Kŏn's leadership marked the beginning of a dynasty that would rule Korea for nearly five centuries and permanently shape Korean political and cultural identity.

## Major Achievements

### Military Unification of the Korean Peninsula

Taejo's most significant achievement was the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms, accomplished through a combination of military conquest, strategic diplomacy, and shrewd political alliances[^34][^35]. After establishing Goryeo in 918 CE, Taejo embarked on an eighteen-year campaign to bring the entire Korean Peninsula under his rule. His primary rivals were the kingdom of Later Baekje, led by the formidable Gyeon Hwon, and the declining but still prestigious kingdom of Silla[^36].

The path to unification was neither quick nor easy. Taejo suffered several devastating military defeats, most notably at the Battle of Gongsan in 927 CE, where Gyeon Hwon's forces inflicted catastrophic losses on Goryeo's army[^37]. Taejo had led 5,000 cavalrymen to intercept Gyeon Hwon's troops as they returned from sacking Silla's capital, but the engagement proved disastrous—Taejo lost most of his army, including his best warrior and kingmaker, Sin Sung-gyŏm[^38][^39]. This defeat exposed Goryeo's vulnerabilities in open-field engagements against Later Baekje's superior cavalry tactics[^40].

Rather than being discouraged by this setback, Taejo adapted his military strategy. He incorporated allied Jurchen cavalry auxiliaries to enhance Goryeo's combined arms approach, integrating archers and heavy infantry more effectively[^41]. He shifted toward strategic encirclement tactics, including naval operations along Later Baekje's southwestern coast to disrupt supply lines and isolate coastal strongholds[^42]. Most importantly, Taejo leveraged diplomatic alliances, notably with the weakening Silla kingdom, to divide Later Baekje's attention and resources while avoiding direct confrontations until conditions were more favorable[^43].

In 935 CE, King Gyeongsun of Silla, recognizing that his kingdom could no longer maintain independence, surrendered his entire territory to Taejo[^44][^45]. Taejo gladly accepted this peaceful submission and granted Gyeongsun the title of prince, demonstrating the magnanimous approach that would characterize his consolidation of power[^46]. The following year, in 936 CE, internal conflicts within Later Baekje provided Taejo with the perfect opportunity. Gyeon Hwon, deposed by his own son and seeking revenge, allied with Taejo[^47]. Together they conquered Later Baekje with an army of 87,500 soldiers, bringing an end to the Later Three Kingdoms period[^48][^49].

This unification was remarkably complete—unlike the earlier unification under Silla in the 7th century (when Balhae emerged as a separate kingdom), Taejo's 936 CE unification created a single state that encompassed nearly all Korean people on the peninsula[^50]. The nation would remain unified under a single government until the division in 1948, making Taejo "the only one who unified the divided nation in its whole history"[^51][^52].

### Governance and Administrative Reforms

Taejo implemented significant administrative and governance reforms that established the foundation for the Goryeo Dynasty's five-century rule[^53]. Upon unifying the Later Three Kingdoms, he faced the enormous challenge of internal integration and establishing a hierarchical order centered on royal authority[^54]. Rather than attempting to rule through military force alone, Taejo adopted an inclusive approach designed to win the loyalty of former enemies and regional power brokers.

He maintained many of the governmental institutions from Silla and distributed lands and prominent government positions to Gyeongsun and other aristocrats from the conquered kingdoms[^55][^56]. This strategy of bringing even his enemies into his ruling coalition helped secure stability and unity for his kingdom[^57]. He gave titles and land to rulers and nobles not only from Later Baekje and Silla but also from Balhae, which had disintegrated around the same time, achieving what Korean historians call a "true national unification"[^58][^59].

Taejo is credited with expanding the aristocracy's access to higher government positions, building new schools, and improving agricultural yields by easing the tax burden on the peasantry[^60][^61]. He instituted land reforms that redistributed land from aristocrats to common people, aiming to strengthen his rule by securing public loyalty[^62]. These reforms balanced the need to reward his supporters with the necessity of establishing a more equitable foundation for long-term stability.

He also developed an innovative administrative system around the capital. The concept of the "king's capital," which initially referred to the royal family's hometown and residential area, was formalized during Taejo's reign through an administrative unit called Gaeju[^63]. This was organized according to Silla's administrative system of counties and prefectures, with Gaeju comprising Songak County (including Gangeum and Songnim Prefectures) and Gaeseong County (including Deoksu and Imjin Prefectures)[^64].

### Promotion of Buddhism and Religious Policy

Taejo promoted Buddhism as Goryeo's national religion, a decision that profoundly shaped Korean culture for centuries[^65][^66]. He firmly believed that "the success of the great enterprise of founding our dynasty is entirely owing to the protective powers of the many Buddhas," and therefore committed to building temples for both the Seon (meditation) and Gyo (doctrinal) Buddhist schools[^67][^68]. This balanced approach allowed for the equal development of different Buddhist traditions, fostering theological diversity and richness in Korean Buddhist thought[^69].

Taejo sponsored numerous temple construction projects, including ten new Buddhist temples at the capital alone[^70][^71]. He fully encouraged the construction of temples and pagodas throughout the Korean Peninsula, especially around the Goryeo capital of Kaeseong[^72]. This massive building program served multiple purposes: it demonstrated royal piety, provided employment, created centers of learning and culture, and helped legitimize the new dynasty through association with the spiritually powerful Buddhist establishment.

Just prior to his death in 943 CE, Taejo produced his famous "Ten Injunctions" (Sip Hunyo), a testament containing his philosophies regarding governance[^73][^74]. Though some historians suggest these may have been written in the century after his death, they nevertheless had a profound influence on government policy for generations[^75][^76]. The Ten Injunctions included explicit direction that the government should not interfere with Buddhism, protecting religious institutions from excessive state control[^77]. Taejo demanded that his successors "should be read morning and night and forever used as a mirror of reflection"[^78].

The Ten Injunctions addressed several crucial areas beyond religion: Taejo predicted probable conflicts with northern nomadic states over former Goguryeo territory and advised strengthening the state; warned against usurpation and internal conflicts among royal clans; and recommended lessening the power of regional lords[^79][^80]. One particularly significant injunction stated, "We have always followed Tang China; do not imitate the Khitan," establishing an anti-Khitan foreign policy as a guiding principle for future rulers[^81].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Excessive Political Marriages and Succession Crisis

One of the most controversial aspects of Taejo's rule was his extensive practice of political marriages, which created significant long-term problems for the dynasty[^82]. To unify the Later Three Kingdoms and prevent uprisings, Taejo married daughters of virtually every local clan leader, eventually acquiring six queens and 23 consorts (some sources mention up to 29 marriage alliances with regional power holders)[^83][^84][^85]. This strategic polygamy fathered 25 sons and nine daughters[^86][^87].

While this marriage strategy gained Taejo support from powerful clans in the short term, it left behind a large number of nobles claiming connections to the throne and demanding positions in the inner circle[^88]. To keep these families satisfied was paramount, as they all commanded their own armies and could rebel at any time[^89]. This created a dangerous power structure where the king's authority was constantly challenged by the competing interests of his wives' families.

The succession crisis that resulted from Taejo's numerous offspring threatened the fledgling kingdom's stability for generations[^90]. Prominent figures among his sons—including Hyejong, Jeongjong, and Gwangjong—engaged in court politics characterized by intense alliances and rivalries over succession and power during Goryeo's formative years[^91]. The competition among Taejo's descendants would periodically erupt into violence and political purges, most notably during the reign of King Gwangjong, who ruthlessly eliminated rival family factions.

Even more controversially, Taejo's marriage practices established a precedent for geunchinhon (marriage between close relatives) that was widely adopted in the royal household, especially among his descendants[^92]. His fourth son, Gwangjong, married his own daughter Queen Daemok and later took his granddaughter as a concubine[^93]. While such practices were intended to keep power within the immediate royal family, they violated Confucian norms and created ethical controversies that would persist throughout the dynasty.

### Failed Military Campaigns and Strategic Errors

Despite his ultimate success in unification, Taejo's military record included significant failures that cost thousands of lives[^94]. The Battle of Gongsan in 927 CE was a catastrophic defeat where Taejo lost most of his 5,000-man cavalry force, including some of his most loyal and capable generals[^95][^96]. This disaster exposed serious deficiencies in Goryeo's military tactics and intelligence gathering.

The Battle of Gochang in 920 CE was another decisive defeat, where Gyeon Hwon's forces crushed Wang Kŏn's army, exposing Goryeo's vulnerabilities in open-field engagements against Later Baekje's superior cavalry-heavy tactics[^97]. These defeats revealed that Taejo's early military strategy was flawed and required significant adaptation. Critics could argue that a more cautious or better-prepared commander might have achieved unification with far fewer casualties.

### Controversial Foreign Policy and Northern Expansion

Taejo's aggressive anti-Khitan foreign policy, while popular among those who valued Goguryeo's legacy, ultimately sowed the seeds for costly future conflicts[^98]. When the Khitan Liao Dynasty sent 50 camels as diplomatic gifts to Goryeo in 942 CE, Taejo dramatically refused the presents, exiled the Liao envoy to an island, and starved the camels to death[^99][^100]. While this gesture demonstrated Taejo's solidarity with the destroyed Balhae kingdom and his commitment to resist Khitan expansion, it also ensured permanent hostility with a powerful neighbor.

Lee Je-hyeon, considered the greatest Confucian scholar of the late Goryeo Dynasty, criticized Taejo's northern advance policy, arguing that it "ultimately became the spark for a long war by making him hostile to the Khitans"[^101]. Lee Ik, a Silhak (Practical Learning) scholar of the late Joseon Dynasty, similarly criticized Taejo's choices regarding this policy[^102]. These scholars argued that Taejo's ideological commitment to reclaiming Goguryeo's former territories prioritized symbolic legacy over practical security considerations, forcing his successors to fight three devastating wars against the Khitan in the early 11th century.

### Incomplete Centralization and Persistent Regionalism

While Taejo successfully unified the peninsula politically, he did not fully centralize power, leaving significant authority in the hands of regional aristocrats[^103]. His strategy of alliance and cooperation with local clans rather than bringing them under direct royal control created a political system where powerful families retained substantial autonomy[^104]. This incomplete centralization would create ongoing challenges for his successors, who struggled to assert royal authority against entrenched regional interests.

Critics argue that Taejo's inclusive approach, while politically necessary for achieving unification, stored up problems for future generations. The powerful families he courted through marriage alliances and land grants would eventually challenge royal authority, contributing to the aristocratic factionalism that plagued Goryeo politics throughout its history.

## Personal Life

### Family Background and Character

Taejo lived from 31 January 877 to 4 July 943, a lifespan of 66 years during which he witnessed and shaped one of the most transformative periods in Korean history[^105][^106]. Born into a wealthy maritime merchant family in Songak, he never forgot his roots or his hometown, making it his capital and favoring his home region throughout his reign[^107]. His upbringing in a merchant family, rather than traditional aristocracy, gave him a pragmatic and flexible approach to politics that differed from more rigidly hierarchical rulers.

Contemporary sources suggest that Taejo possessed exceptional charisma and leadership qualities that inspired fierce loyalty among his followers[^108]. The fact that four of Kung Ye's top generals chose him to replace their increasingly tyrannical king indicates that Taejo had earned their trust and respect through demonstrated competence and personal character. His initial reluctance to accept the crown (whether genuine or politically calculated) also suggests either personal humility or shrewd political instincts about the importance of appearing reluctant to seize power.

Taejo's faith in Buddhism was profound and genuine, not merely a political tool[^109]. He credited the "protective powers of the many Buddhas" with his success in founding Goryeo and committed substantial resources to temple construction and supporting the Buddhist clergy[^110]. This religious devotion coexisted with a pragmatic political sense—he championed Confucian principles in governance while promoting Buddhism as the national religion, demonstrating an ability to synthesize different philosophical traditions[^111].

### Marriages and Family Relationships

Taejo's practice of marrying daughters of every local clan leader resulted in an extraordinarily complex family structure with six queens and 23 consorts[^112][^113]. This meant he had an estimated 34 children—25 sons and nine daughters—most of whom married each other in the Goryeo royal family's practice of close-relative marriage[^114][^115]. Managing relationships among so many wives, their powerful families, and numerous children must have consumed considerable time and political energy.

The identities of some of Taejo's queens are recorded in historical sources. Queen Sinjeong of the Hwangbo clan from Hwangju was the mother of Daejong (Wang Uk), who would later father King Seongjong, ensuring the continuation of Taejo's direct line on the throne[^116][^117]. The extensive network of children through his numerous marriages helped establish and maintain the Goryeo royal lineage for generations, though it also created the succession conflicts that plagued his descendants[^118].

Taejo was succeeded first by his son Hyejong (r. 943–945), then by his second son Jeongjong (r. 945–949), and then by his third son Gwangjong (r. 949–975)[^119][^120]. The pattern of succession among his sons, rather than following strict primogeniture, reflected the complex political dynamics among the different maternal family factions. According to the third of Taejo's Ten Injunctions, "the eldest legitimate royal issue" should ascend the throne, though this principle was not always followed in practice[^121].

### Final Years and Death

In his final years, Taejo focused on consolidating the unification he had achieved and establishing principles for his successors to follow[^122]. Seven years after achieving the complete unification of the Korean Peninsula in 936 CE, he composed his Ten Injunctions, attempting to codify the lessons he had learned through decades of warfare and political struggle[^123]. This document reveals a ruler deeply concerned about the future stability of his dynasty and attempting to guide his heirs away from the mistakes he had observed or made himself.

Taejo died on 4 July 943 CE at the age of 66 in Sindeokjeon Palace after an illness, having ruled for 25 years[^124][^125]. He spent his final years in Gaegyeong, the capital he had established in his hometown[^126]. His tomb is located in Haesong-ri, Gaepung County, near Gaeseong, just north of the Imjingang River—a location that is now just over the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in North Korea, making it largely inaccessible to South Koreans[^127][^128].

The fact that Taejo's tomb now lies in North Korea, separated from most Koreans by one of the world's most heavily fortified borders, adds a layer of tragic irony to his legacy as the unifier of Korea. The man who achieved what no other Korean ruler accomplished—the complete unification of the Korean people under a single state—now rests in a divided land, his grave a symbol of both historical unity and contemporary division.

## Legacy

### Foundation of Korean National Identity

Taejo's most enduring legacy is the establishment of a unified Korean identity that transcended the older regional identities of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla[^129][^130]. According to Korean historians, it was during the Goryeo period that these individual kingdoms' separate identities were successfully merged into a single entity that became the basis of modern Korean identity[^131]. This cultural unification proved even more significant than the political unification, creating a shared sense of Korean-ness that persists to the present day.

The very name "Korea" derives from "Goryeo," which itself evokes "Goguryeo"—Taejo's dynasty literally gave Korea its name in the international community[^132][^133]. This linguistic legacy ensures that every time the country is mentioned in English or most other Western languages, Taejo's kingdom is remembered. The Goryeo Dynasty would oversee an unprecedented flourishing of Korean culture, including developments in celadon pottery, printing technology, and Buddhist art that are still celebrated as pinnacles of Korean civilization[^134][^135].

### Political and Territorial Legacy

Taejo's unification in 936 CE created a unified state that persisted until 1948, when Korea was divided into North and South—a span of over one thousand years[^136][^137]. This represents one of the longest periods of continuous political unity for any nation in world history. The borders Taejo established, while they fluctuated over time, essentially defined what Koreans considered their national territory for the next millennium.

Goryeo achieved what has been called a "true national unification" because it not only unified the Later Three Kingdoms but also incorporated much of the ruling class of Balhae, the northern kingdom with Goguryeo origins[^138][^139]. This gave Goryeo a legitimate claim to be the successor to all the previous Korean kingdoms, a claim that provided powerful ideological legitimacy. Taejo laid claim to the northern parts of the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria, which he considered his rightful legacy as the successor of Goguryeo[^140].

### Contemporary Relevance and Symbolism

Many modern Koreans look upon Taejo's legacy—as "the only one who unified the divided nation in its whole history"—to find hope for reunification and to draw comparisons with the current situation[^141][^142]. In both North and South Korea, Taejo is celebrated as a national hero and unifier, one of the few historical figures who commands universal respect across the political divide. His achievement of bringing together a fractured peninsula through a combination of military force, diplomatic skill, and inclusive governance provides a historical precedent that resonates powerfully in the context of contemporary division.

The location of Taejo's tomb just north of the DMZ has made it a symbol of division and a potential site for future reconciliation efforts. Some have proposed joint Korean heritage projects to preserve and honor Taejo's burial site as part of confidence-building measures between North and South Korea, though political tensions have prevented such initiatives from advancing significantly.

### Institutional and Religious Legacy

Taejo's promotion of Buddhism as the national religion shaped Korean culture, art, and philosophy for the entire Goryeo period and beyond[^143]. The temples he built and the traditions he supported became centers of learning, artistic production, and spiritual practice that enriched Korean civilization immeasurably. His Ten Injunctions influenced government policy for centuries, with later rulers citing them as authoritative guidance on everything from foreign policy to succession practices[^144][^145].

His governance model—which balanced centralized royal authority with aristocratic participation, incorporated conquered elites rather than destroying them, and combined Buddhist spirituality with Confucian administrative principles—established patterns that would characterize Korean statecraft throughout the pre-modern period. Even when the Joseon Dynasty replaced Goryeo in 1392 and officially elevated Confucianism over Buddhism, many of the governmental structures and political principles Taejo established continued to operate.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern Korean historians and scholars overwhelmingly regard Taejo as one of the greatest figures in Korean history, placing him alongside King Sejong the Great as a foundational national hero[^146]. His achievement in unifying the Later Three Kingdoms through a combination of military conquest and diplomatic inclusion is seen as a masterpiece of strategic leadership. Scholars particularly praise his inclusive approach to governance, which integrated former enemies into his administration rather than engaging in vindictive purges[^147][^148].

King Taejo Wang Geon is credited with founding the Goryeo Dynasty in 918, building a united kingdom on the Korean Peninsula, ending the chaos of the Later Three Kingdoms, setting the direction for a new era, and laying the groundwork for an imperial state[^149]. Historians emphasize that his unification was more complete than the earlier 7th-century unification under Silla because it created a single state encompassing virtually all Korean people, rather than leaving Balhae as a separate kingdom[^150].

Academic research, such as the work examining "King Taejo's Buddhist View and Statecraft in Tenth-Century Korea," analyzes how his religious beliefs were integrated with practical governance, revealing a sophisticated political philosophy[^151]. Scholars note that Taejo credited his success to Buddhism, stating that "the success of the great enterprise of founding our dynasty is entirely owing to the protective powers of the many Buddhas," demonstrating how religious conviction and political strategy reinforced each other in his rule[^152].

Different Confucian scholars have developed various theories about the source of Taejo's political legitimacy. Yi Saek based legitimacy on the founder's achievements in establishing Goryeo's cultural and political foundation (the "founding service" conception), while Jeong Do-jeon based it on the founder himself who established the dynasty in 918 (the "founder's ownership" conception)[^153]. Both perspectives acknowledge Taejo's central importance, differing only on the philosophical basis of his authority.

His Ten Injunctions are regarded as a masterpiece of political wisdom, demonstrating remarkable foresight about the challenges his dynasty would face[^154]. His warning about the Khitans proved prophetic when Goryeo fought three major wars against the Khitan Liao Dynasty in the early 11th century. His advice about preventing internal conflicts among royal clans addressed one of the perpetual challenges of dynastic governance. The fact that these injunctions were read and referenced for centuries after his death testifies to their perceived value.

Contemporary South Korean historians emphasize Taejo's role in creating a unified Korean national identity that transcended regional loyalties[^155]. The Gyeonggi Cultural Foundation notes that Taejo "set the directions of the order of a new era while laying the groundwork for an imperial state," highlighting his role not just as a military conqueror but as a state-builder and institutional innovator[^156]. His decision to move the capital to his hometown and create a special administrative zone around it is seen as an early example of capital region development that influenced Korean spatial politics for centuries.

### Negative Views

Despite his generally positive historical reputation, some scholars and historians have criticized aspects of Taejo's rule and the long-term consequences of his policies[^157]. Lee Je-hyeon, the greatest Confucian scholar of the late Goryeo Dynasty, criticized Taejo's northern advance policy, arguing that "it ultimately became the spark for a long war by making him hostile to the Khitans"[^158]. This critique suggests that Taejo's ideological commitment to reclaiming Goguryeo's former territories and his dramatic rejection of Khitan diplomatic overtures prioritized symbolic gestures over practical security considerations.

Lee Ik, a Silhak (Practical Learning) scholar of the late Joseon Dynasty, similarly criticized Taejo's choices regarding the northern policy, suggesting that a more pragmatic approach to relations with the Khitan might have spared Korea from the devastating invasions that came in the early 11th century[^159]. These scholars represent a tradition of historical analysis that questions whether Taejo's anti-Khitan stance, while emotionally satisfying and ideologically consistent with his Goguryeo revivalism, served Korea's long-term interests.

Critics also point to the succession crisis created by Taejo's excessive political marriages as a fundamental flaw in his state-building[^160]. While these marriages were necessary to secure short-term political alliances, they created a royal family structure so complex and faction-ridden that it destabilized the early Goryeo court. The violent power struggles among Taejo's descendants, particularly during Gwangjong's reign, resulted in purges and executions that undermined the inclusive, conciliatory approach Taejo had modeled.

Some historians argue that Taejo's failure to fully centralize power and his reliance on aristocratic families left Goryeo perpetually vulnerable to aristocratic factionalism[^161]. Unlike more autocratic state-builders who thoroughly subordinated regional powers to central authority, Taejo's collaborative approach preserved significant aristocratic autonomy. While this facilitated peaceful unification, it meant that powerful families could challenge royal authority throughout Goryeo's history, contributing to the political instability that eventually weakened the dynasty.

Modern critical scholarship also examines the costs of Taejo's unification campaigns. While his ultimate success is celebrated, the eighteen-year campaign involved considerable bloodshed, economic disruption, and human suffering[^162]. The Battle of Gongsan alone cost thousands of lives, including many of Taejo's most loyal supporters. A more critical historical perspective asks whether the benefits of unification justified these costs and whether a more patient or diplomatic approach might have achieved similar results with less violence.

Additionally, some scholars note that while Taejo promoted Buddhism extensively, his heavy investment in temple construction and support for the Buddhist clergy created economic burdens and contributed to the excessive influence of Buddhist institutions in government affairs[^163]. Later Goryeo reformers and eventually Joseon Dynasty founders would identify Buddhist institutional power as a source of corruption and inefficiency, tracing this problem back to the strong state support for Buddhism that Taejo initiated.
