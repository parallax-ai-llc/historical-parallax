## Summary

Nikolaas Tinbergen was a Dutch-British ethologist and ornithologist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch. He established the four key questions for studying animal behavior (causation, development, evolution, and function). His work on instinct, particularly the stickleback fish, became classic studies in behavioral biology.
