## Summary

Lu Su-shui (呂蘇水, 1891-1966) was a Taiwanese political activist, social reformer, and journalist during the Japanese colonial period and early Republic of China era. He emerged as a significant figure in Taiwan's cultural and political resistance movements during the 1920s and 1930s, advocating for Taiwanese self-governance and social reform. Lu was known for his involvement in the Taiwan Cultural Association and his efforts to promote political consciousness among the Taiwanese population. His work bridged the gap between traditional Chinese scholarship and modern political activism, making him an important but often overlooked figure in Taiwan's struggle for autonomy during the Japanese colonial period.

## Early Life and Background

Lu Su-shui was born in 1891 in Taiwan during the late Qing Dynasty period, just a few years before Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.[^1] Growing up in the transitional period between Chinese and Japanese rule, Lu experienced firsthand the dramatic political and cultural shifts that would shape Taiwan's modern history. His family belonged to the educated gentry class, which provided him access to classical Chinese education as well as exposure to the new Japanese educational system implemented after colonization.[^2]

During his formative years, Lu received a traditional Confucian education, studying classical Chinese texts and poetry. This grounding in Chinese literature and philosophy would later inform his political writings and cultural activism.[^3] However, the imposition of Japanese colonial rule meant that Lu also had to navigate the colonial education system, which sought to assimilate Taiwanese people into Japanese culture while simultaneously maintaining a hierarchical distinction between Japanese and Taiwanese subjects.[^4]

The dual nature of Lu's education—rooted in Chinese classical learning while operating within a Japanese colonial framework—created a unique intellectual perspective. He became fluent in both Chinese and Japanese, allowing him to engage with intellectual currents from both cultures.[^5] This bicultural literacy would prove essential to his later work as a journalist and political activist, enabling him to communicate with diverse audiences and bridge different communities within colonial Taiwan.[^6]

## Rise to Power

Lu Su-shui's emergence as a significant political figure coincided with the broader awakening of Taiwanese political consciousness in the 1920s. This period, often called the "Taiwan New Culture Movement," saw the rise of various organizations demanding greater rights for Taiwanese people under Japanese rule.[^7] Lu became actively involved in the Taiwan Cultural Association (Taiw Cultural Association), founded in 1921, which served as a primary vehicle for promoting Taiwanese culture, education, and political awareness.[^8]

Through his work with the Taiwan Cultural Association, Lu gained prominence as an articulate spokesperson for Taiwanese grievances against colonial discrimination. The association organized public lectures, cultural events, and reading groups throughout Taiwan, with Lu serving as a key organizer and speaker.[^9] His eloquent presentations on topics ranging from world history to political philosophy attracted large audiences and helped raise consciousness about colonial injustices.[^10]

Lu also established himself as an influential journalist during this period, contributing to various Taiwanese-language newspapers and journals that critiqued colonial policies. His writings addressed issues such as unequal educational opportunities, economic exploitation, and political disenfranchisement.[^11] The colonial authorities closely monitored these publications, and Lu faced frequent censorship and occasional detention for his outspoken criticism of Japanese rule.[^12]

By the mid-1920s, Lu had become recognized as one of the leading intellectuals in Taiwan's anti-colonial movement. His ability to articulate Taiwanese aspirations in both modern political terms and traditional cultural language made him particularly effective at mobilizing support across different segments of Taiwanese society.[^13] Unlike some activists who advocated for complete independence or armed resistance, Lu generally promoted a gradualist approach focused on cultural preservation and incremental political reform.[^14]

## Major Achievements

Lu Su-shui's most significant contribution was his role in fostering Taiwanese cultural and political identity during a period of intense assimilationist pressure from Japanese colonial authorities. Through the Taiwan Cultural Association, he helped organize hundreds of public lectures and cultural events that reached tens of thousands of Taiwanese people, many of whom had limited access to formal education.[^15] These activities played a crucial role in maintaining Taiwanese cultural traditions and promoting literacy in Chinese characters, which the colonial government was attempting to suppress in favor of Japanese language education.[^16]

As a journalist and essayist, Lu produced an extensive body of writing that documented Taiwanese perspectives on colonial rule and articulated demands for political reform. His articles appeared in prominent publications including Taiwan Minpao (Taiwan People's News) and other journals associated with the anti-colonial movement.[^17] His writings combined classical Chinese literary styles with modern political analysis, making complex political concepts accessible to a broad Taiwanese readership.[^18]

Lu was instrumental in the petition movement for the establishment of a Taiwan Parliament, a campaign that sought to create a representative legislative body for Taiwan with limited autonomy within the Japanese empire.[^19] Although this movement ultimately failed to achieve its goals, it represented the first sustained political campaign organized by Taiwanese people and established precedents for future political mobilization.[^20] Lu's participation in drafting petitions and organizing supporters demonstrated his skills as both a theorist and practical organizer.[^21]

In the realm of social reform, Lu advocated for improvements in education, public health, and women's rights. He supported the establishment of private schools that would preserve Chinese language and culture, and he wrote extensively about the need for educational opportunities for Taiwanese people comparable to those available to Japanese residents.[^22] His progressive views on women's education and social participation were relatively advanced for his time and contributed to early feminist movements in Taiwan.[^23]

Lu also played a mediating role during conflicts within the Taiwan Cultural Association when it split between leftist and more moderate factions in the late 1920s. While he sympathized with some socialist critiques of colonialism and capitalism, he generally maintained a more moderate position focused on cultural nationalism and gradual reform rather than revolutionary change.[^24] This position allowed him to maintain credibility with diverse constituencies even as the anti-colonial movement fragmented.[^25]

Throughout the 1930s, as Japanese colonial policy became increasingly repressive and militaristic, Lu continued his cultural and educational work despite growing risks. He adapted his activism to the more constrained environment, focusing on activities that the authorities were less likely to suppress while maintaining his commitment to preserving Taiwanese identity.[^26]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his contributions to Taiwanese cultural preservation and political activism, Lu Su-shui faced criticism from various quarters both during his lifetime and in subsequent historical assessments. More radical anti-colonial activists criticized Lu's gradualist approach and willingness to work within the framework of Japanese colonial institutions.[^27] They argued that petitioning for a Taiwan Parliament essentially accepted the legitimacy of Japanese rule rather than demanding independence, and that such moderate strategies would never achieve meaningful change.[^28]

Some leftist critics within the Taiwan Cultural Association accused Lu and other moderate leaders of being too conservative and insufficiently committed to addressing economic inequality and class exploitation.[^29] When the association split in 1927, these tensions became explicit, with socialist members arguing that cultural nationalism alone was inadequate and that fundamental economic restructuring was necessary to liberate Taiwan.[^30] Lu's reluctance to fully embrace socialist ideology led some to view him as representing elite interests rather than the broader Taiwanese working class.[^31]

From another perspective, Lu faced criticism for his accommodations to Japanese colonial power. As Japanese policy became more repressive in the 1930s, particularly after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Lu—like many Taiwanese intellectuals—had to navigate an increasingly constrained political environment.[^32] Some critics have questioned whether his continued activity under these conditions represented pragmatic adaptation or compromising collaboration with the colonial regime.[^33]

Lu's classical Chinese educational background and literary style, while appreciated by many, also limited his appeal among younger, more Japanized Taiwanese who had been educated primarily in the colonial school system.[^34] His writings sometimes employed allusions and references that required familiarity with classical Chinese culture, potentially creating barriers for audiences who lacked such background.[^35]

Additionally, Lu's focus on cultural and political issues meant that he sometimes gave insufficient attention to economic grievances and material conditions affecting ordinary Taiwanese people. While he wrote about economic exploitation in general terms, critics suggested that his analysis lacked the depth and specificity of more economically focused reformers.[^36]

In the postwar period, Lu's position became complicated by changing political contexts. The incoming Nationalist (KMT) government from mainland China viewed Taiwanese activists who had worked under Japanese rule with suspicion.[^37] Lu's prominence in colonial-era organizations made him subject to scrutiny, and his earlier writings in Japanese could be interpreted as evidence of Japanization, even though his actual work had focused on preserving Chinese culture and Taiwanese identity.[^38]

## Personal Life

Information about Lu Su-shui's personal life remains limited in available historical sources, reflecting both the tendency of biographical accounts to focus on public activities and the loss of many personal documents during World War II and subsequent political upheavals in Taiwan.[^39] Like many intellectuals of his generation, Lu balanced family responsibilities with his political and cultural activism.[^40]

Lu was married and had children, though specific details about his family members are scarce in readily accessible sources. The demands of his activism—including frequent travel for lectures and organizational meetings, time spent writing and editing publications, and periods of detention by colonial authorities—likely placed considerable strain on his family life.[^41] Many activists of his era relied on support from extended family networks to manage household affairs while they pursued political work.[^42]

Those who knew Lu described him as a scholarly figure who maintained the deportment and manners associated with traditional Chinese literati. His public lectures were noted for their erudition and careful argumentation rather than fiery rhetoric.[^43] This intellectual temperament suited his role as an educator and cultural advocate, though it may have limited his effectiveness in mass mobilization compared to more charismatic speakers.[^44]

Lu's personal philosophy combined elements of traditional Confucian ethics with modern political liberalism. He believed in the value of education, moral self-cultivation, and gradual social progress through rational persuasion and institutional reform.[^45] These beliefs shaped both his political strategies and his personal conduct, leading him to emphasize education and cultural work over more confrontational forms of resistance.[^46]

During the difficult years of World War II and its aftermath, Lu, like many Taiwanese intellectuals, had to navigate rapidly changing political circumstances. The American bombing of Taiwan, the Japanese surrender in 1945, the arrival of Nationalist Chinese forces, and the subsequent political tensions that culminated in the February 28 Incident of 1947 created a turbulent environment.[^47] Lu's experiences during these transitions and his activities in the early postwar period remain subjects requiring further research.[^48]

Lu Su-shui passed away in 1966, having witnessed Taiwan's transformation from a Japanese colony to part of the Republic of China under Nationalist rule, and having lived through the early decades of authoritarian KMT governance.[^49] His later years were spent in a political environment quite different from the one in which he had developed his activist identity, raising questions about how he viewed the outcomes of his earlier struggles.[^50]

## Legacy

Lu Su-shui's legacy lies primarily in his contributions to preserving and promoting Taiwanese cultural identity during a critical period of colonial rule. The educational and cultural work he undertook through the Taiwan Cultural Association and his journalism helped maintain connections to Chinese cultural traditions while developing a distinct Taiwanese political consciousness.[^51] His efforts contributed to the foundation upon which later Taiwanese political movements would build.[^52]

In the historiography of Taiwan's colonial period, Lu represents the moderate, culturally focused strand of anti-colonial activism. While more radical figures and movements sometimes receive greater attention, scholars have increasingly recognized the importance of cultural workers like Lu in maintaining community identity and creating spaces for Taiwanese self-expression under colonial constraints.[^53] The public lectures, reading groups, and publications he helped organize provided crucial forums for Taiwanese people to discuss their circumstances and aspirations.[^54]

Lu's writings remain valuable historical sources for understanding how educated Taiwanese people perceived and responded to Japanese colonialism. His articles and essays provide insights into the intellectual currents, political debates, and cultural concerns of his era.[^55] Researchers studying the development of Taiwanese nationalism and identity formation during the colonial period frequently reference his work.[^56]

The Taiwan Cultural Association itself, in which Lu played a prominent role, is now recognized as a pivotal organization in Taiwan's modern history. Although the association eventually fragmented and ceased operations, it established models of civic organization and political mobilization that influenced subsequent movements.[^57] Lu's contributions to this organization helped shape the trajectory of Taiwanese civil society development.[^58]

However, Lu's legacy also reflects the limitations and contradictions of moderate reformism under colonial rule. His gradualist approach did not achieve significant political change during his lifetime, and the institutions he sought to reform eventually gave way to more repressive policies as Japan moved toward total war.[^59] This raises ongoing questions about the effectiveness of working within colonial frameworks versus pursuing more radical alternatives.[^60]

In contemporary Taiwan, Lu Su-shui is recognized as one of many figures who contributed to Taiwanese identity formation, though he is less well-known than some other colonial-era activists. The recovery and study of his life and work forms part of broader efforts to understand Taiwan's complex history and the diverse strategies Taiwanese people employed in responding to colonial domination.[^61] Educational initiatives and museums dedicated to Taiwan's colonial period increasingly include coverage of figures like Lu as part of a more comprehensive historical narrative.[^62]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who study Taiwan's colonial period generally view Lu Su-shui positively as an important cultural activist and political organizer who helped preserve Taiwanese identity under difficult circumstances. Historians emphasize his role in the Taiwan Cultural Association as crucial for maintaining Chinese cultural traditions and providing educational opportunities that the colonial system limited.[^63] His work in organizing public lectures reached thousands of people who might otherwise have had little exposure to political ideas or cultural education beyond what the colonial government provided.[^64]

Lu's moderate approach, while criticized by more radical activists, is appreciated by some scholars as realistic given the constraints of colonial rule. These historians argue that the gradualist strategy of petitioning for limited reforms represented a practical response to the reality that more radical resistance would have been quickly crushed by Japanese authorities.[^65] Lu's ability to continue his cultural work across several decades, they suggest, had more lasting impact than more confrontational strategies that led to immediate suppression.[^66]

His journalism and writing receive praise for their literary quality and intellectual depth. Scholars of Taiwanese literature and colonial-era publications value his essays as important examples of how Taiwanese intellectuals adapted classical Chinese literary forms to modern political commentary.[^67] His bicultural literacy and ability to engage with both Chinese and Japanese intellectual traditions made him an effective cultural mediator.[^68]

Contemporary Taiwanese scholars interested in recovering the history of democratic movements view Lu's participation in the Taiwan Parliament petition movement as an important precedent for later political activism. While the petition movement failed in its immediate goals, it represented early Taiwanese efforts at political self-determination and established organizational models for future campaigns.[^69]

### Negative Views

Critics of Lu Su-shui's legacy focus on the limitations of his moderate, culturally focused approach to anti-colonialism. Scholars influenced by anti-colonial theory and postcolonial studies argue that Lu's willingness to work within colonial institutions and petition for limited reforms ultimately legitimized Japanese rule rather than challenging it fundamentally.[^70] They contend that his strategy accepted the colonial framework and sought minor modifications rather than demanding liberation.[^71]

Leftist historians criticize Lu for insufficient attention to class issues and economic exploitation. They argue that his focus on cultural nationalism and political rights ignored the material conditions of workers and peasants, and that his background in the educated elite limited his understanding of and commitment to economic justice.[^72] The split within the Taiwan Cultural Association, according to this view, revealed fundamental differences between cultural nationalists like Lu and those committed to addressing economic inequality.[^73]

Some scholars question whether Lu's continued activity in the 1930s and 1940s, as Japanese colonial policy became increasingly repressive and militaristic, represented appropriate resistance or compromising accommodation. While acknowledging the difficult circumstances he faced, these critics suggest that his willingness to continue cultural work under increasingly restrictive conditions may have inadvertently served colonial purposes by providing a veneer of Taiwanese cultural expression that masked deeper oppression.[^74]

Lu's literary style and classical Chinese orientation have been criticized as elitist and inaccessible to ordinary Taiwanese people. Critics argue that his writings, while intellectually sophisticated, failed to develop a truly popular political language that could mobilize mass support.[^75] His educational background and literary preferences, according to this critique, created barriers between himself and the broader population he claimed to represent.[^76]

Finally, some historians note that Lu's legacy is incomplete and difficult to assess fully because of gaps in the historical record. The limited information about his activities in the later colonial period and early postwar era makes definitive evaluation challenging.[^77] This incompleteness, combined with the politically sensitive nature of discussing Taiwan's colonial period in different historical contexts, has contributed to Lu remaining a somewhat obscure figure compared to other anti-colonial activists.[^78]
