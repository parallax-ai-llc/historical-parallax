## Summary

Gampopa was a Tibetan Buddhist monk and physician who combined the monastic Kadampa tradition with the tantric Mahamudra teachings of Milarepa. He founded the institutional structure of the Kagyu school. His Jewel Ornament of Liberation is one of the most important lamrim (stages of the path) texts in Tibetan Buddhism. He established Daklha Gampo Monastery, from which the four major and eight minor Kagyu sub-schools emerged.
