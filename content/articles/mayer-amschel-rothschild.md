## Summary

Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) was a German-Jewish banker and the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty, one of the most influential financial families in modern history. Born in the Frankfurt ghetto, he established a successful money exchange and banking business that served European nobility, particularly William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Through strategic placement of his five sons across major European financial centers—Frankfurt, London, Paris, Vienna, and Naples—Rothschild created an international banking network that financed governments and facilitated trade during the tumultuous Napoleonic era. His business acumen, combined with innovative financial instruments and rapid communication systems, transformed his family from modest beginnings into financial titans whose influence would span centuries.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born on February 23, 1744, in the Judengasse (Jewish ghetto) of Frankfurt am Main, in what was then the Holy Roman Empire. He was born into a family of merchants and money changers; his father, Amschel Moses Rothschild, dealt in silk cloth and currency exchange. The family name derived from the red shield ("rot schild" in German) that hung outside their house in the ghetto, a common practice for identifying Jewish homes in an era before street numbers.[^3][^4]

Life in the Frankfurt ghetto was characterized by severe restrictions on Jewish residents. Jews were confined to a narrow street, forbidden from entering public parks, and subject to numerous occupational limitations. They could not engage in most crafts or own land, which channeled many Jewish families toward commerce and money lending—professions Christians often avoided due to religious prohibitions against usury.[^5] The ghetto was overcrowded, unsanitary, and locked at night, with a limited number of Jewish families permitted to live there.

Despite these constraints, Mayer received an education that proved crucial to his future success. After his father's death when Mayer was young, he was sent to study at a yeshiva in Fürth, where he received traditional Jewish religious education. However, following his mother's death in 1756, he left his religious studies and began an apprenticeship at the banking house of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer in Hanover, one of the most prominent Jewish banking families in Germany.[^6] This apprenticeship exposed him to the world of finance, court politics, and the art of dealing with nobility—skills that would define his career.

During his time in Hanover, Rothschild also developed expertise in rare coins and antiques, knowledge that would provide his initial entry into elite circles. He returned to Frankfurt in 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War, inheriting his father's modest money-changing business. Initially, he supplemented the family business by dealing in rare coins, medals, and antiques, which allowed him to make connections with wealthy collectors among the German nobility.[^7][^8]

## Rise to Power

Rothschild's ascent from a modest ghetto merchant to financial powerhouse began with his cultivation of relationships with German nobility, particularly through his numismatic expertise. In 1769, he secured a pivotal appointment as court agent (Hoffaktor) to Crown Prince Wilhelm of Hanau, who would later become Wilhelm IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. This position granted Rothschild the coveted title "Crown Agent to His Serene Highness, Prince William of Hanau," which he proudly displayed on a sign outside his shop—a significant status symbol that elevated his standing among both Jewish and Christian merchants.[^9][^10]

Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel was one of the wealthiest royals in Europe, having accumulated vast wealth through the practice of hiring out Hessian soldiers as mercenaries, particularly to the British during the American Revolutionary War. Managing Wilhelm's fortune provided Rothschild with both capital and credibility. He began by handling smaller financial transactions, proving his reliability and discretion, then gradually expanded into larger operations including government bond trading and extending credit to various German principalities.[^11]

The political upheaval of the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars (1789-1815) created unprecedented opportunities for those who could navigate the chaos. While warfare disrupted traditional trade routes and banking networks, the Rothschilds developed systems to move money, goods, and information across battle lines. Mayer Amschel demonstrated remarkable foresight in positioning his five sons strategically across Europe: Amschel in Frankfurt, Salomon in Vienna, Nathan in London, Carl in Naples, and James in Paris. This geographic distribution created a financial network that transcended national boundaries and political conflicts.[^12][^13]

The family's international structure allowed them to conduct business when other banking houses failed. They developed a sophisticated courier system using trusted agents who could cross borders and military lines, enabling the Rothschilds to move funds and transmit market information faster than competitors or even governments. This intelligence advantage proved especially valuable in trading government bonds and currencies, where hours could mean the difference between profit and loss.[^14]

Mayer Amschel's genius lay not merely in financial acumen but in creating a family-based business structure governed by strict principles. He established rules requiring family members to maintain unity, share information, and reinvest profits into the business rather than excessive personal consumption. He insisted his sons work together and avoid destructive competition, famously advising them to maintain family cohesion above all else. This institutional framework proved as important as any individual transaction in building the Rothschild empire.[^15][^16]

## Major Achievements

Mayer Amschel Rothschild's most significant achievement was establishing the foundation of the Rothschild banking dynasty, which became the most powerful financial institution of the 19th century. By the time of his death in 1812, he had transformed a small money-changing operation in Frankfurt's ghetto into an international banking network with tentacles reaching across Europe's major financial centers. This network would finance governments, facilitate international trade, and influence political decisions for generations.[^17]

One of Rothschild's key innovations was the development of international finance mechanisms that transcended traditional banking limitations. During an era when moving large sums of money across borders was dangerous and inefficient—particularly during wartime—the Rothschild network could transfer funds through bills of exchange and sophisticated accounting systems that minimized physical transport of gold and currency. This capability made the family indispensable to governments needing to finance military operations or manage international debts.[^18]

The Rothschild courier system represented another major achievement. Mayer Amschel established a network of trusted messengers who carried not only financial instruments but also market intelligence between his sons' operations across Europe. These couriers used various routes and disguises to evade customs officials, military checkpoints, and competing spies. The information advantage this system provided allowed the Rothschilds to anticipate market movements and political developments before others, enabling profitable trades in government bonds, currencies, and commodities.[^19][^20]

Rothschild's relationship with Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel produced some of his most profitable ventures. When Napoleon's armies threatened Wilhelm's territory, the landgrave fled, entrusting substantial portions of his fortune to Rothschild's management. Rather than simply safeguarding these funds, Mayer Amschel and his son Nathan invested them strategically, particularly in British government bonds and gold trading. These investments generated substantial returns, enriching both Wilhelm and the Rothschild family while cementing their reputation for trustworthiness and financial skill.[^21]

The family's involvement in financing European governments during the Napoleonic Wars marked their emergence as truly international financiers. They provided loans to various states, managed bond issues, and facilitated payments between allies. After the wars ended, the Rothschilds played a crucial role in the financial reconstruction of Europe, arranging loans that helped stabilize national economies and fund industrial development. This positioned them as essential partners to governments throughout the 19th century.[^22][^23]

Mayer Amschel also pioneered certain business practices that became standard in modern banking. He emphasized strict confidentiality regarding client affairs, meticulous record-keeping, and rapid response to market opportunities. He diversified operations across multiple sectors including foreign exchange, bullion trading, government finance, and commercial lending. His insistence on maintaining substantial liquid reserves enabled the family to weather financial crises that destroyed competitors. These principles of prudent yet aggressive capitalism became hallmarks of the Rothschild approach.[^24]

Beyond finance, Rothschild's achievement in elevating his family from ghetto poverty to aristocratic wealth represented a remarkable social transformation. Despite the severe restrictions on Jews in 18th-century Germany, he leveraged his abilities to build relationships with Christian nobility, navigate complex political environments, and create opportunities where few existed. While he never escaped the legal disabilities imposed on Jews during his lifetime, his success laid groundwork for his descendants to eventually receive noble titles and social acceptance across Europe.[^25]

His legacy includes the establishment of enduring business principles encoded in his will and family agreements. He mandated that daughters and their husbands be excluded from the business (a policy reflecting contemporary gender norms), that sons maintain unity and coordinate their activities, and that the family name and reputation be guarded zealously. These rules, while controversial by modern standards, proved effective in maintaining family cohesion and business continuity across multiple generations—a rare achievement among commercial dynasties.[^26]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his descendants have been subjects of sustained controversy, conspiracy theories, and criticism spanning over two centuries. Much of this criticism reflects antisemitic prejudices that have used the Rothschild name as a symbol of alleged Jewish financial manipulation and secret control over world affairs.[^27]

The family's wealth and influence made them targets for antisemitic propaganda from the early 19th century onward. Critics portrayed the Rothschilds as puppet masters controlling governments through debt, manipulating wars for profit, and forming part of a supposed international Jewish conspiracy to dominate global finance. These accusations intensified during periods of economic hardship and political instability, when scapegoats were sought for complex problems. Nazi propaganda particularly vilified the Rothschilds as exemplars of "Jewish capitalism," confiscating their properties and using their name in antisemitic literature and films.[^28][^29]

Some specific business practices attracted legitimate criticism. The family's strategy of financing multiple sides during conflicts—providing loans to various governments regardless of political alignment—struck many as morally questionable. Critics argued this approach prioritized profit over principle, enabling destructive wars by ensuring all parties had access to capital. While defenders noted that banking houses traditionally maintained neutrality to serve diverse clients, the criticism highlighted tensions between commercial logic and ethical considerations in international finance.[^30]

The Rothschild courier network and information advantages raised concerns about market manipulation. Their ability to receive news—such as the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo—before official channels led to legends (some exaggerated or false) about Nathan Rothschild exploiting this knowledge to profit enormously from bond trading. While the family certainly benefited from superior information, questions about insider trading and unfair advantages in securities markets have persisted. Modern financial regulations against insider trading partly emerged from concerns about exactly the type of information asymmetries the Rothschilds exploited.[^31][^32]

The family's immense wealth concentration attracted criticism from both left-wing and populist movements. Socialists and economic reformers pointed to the Rothschilds as exemplars of capitalism's tendency toward extreme inequality and oligarchic power. Their ability to influence government policies through control of public debt raised questions about democratic accountability—could elected governments truly represent citizens when dependent on private bankers for financing? These critiques, while sometimes mixed with antisemitism, raised valid concerns about plutocracy and the political power of concentrated wealth.[^33]

Mayer Amschel's treatment of his daughters in his will and business arrangements reflected patriarchal norms that excluded women from economic power. His stipulation that daughters and their husbands be barred from the business and denied full inheritance rights limited opportunities for half his descendants based solely on gender. While typical for his era, this policy reinforced gender inequalities and deprived the family of potential talent.[^34]

The family's relationship with various governments sometimes involved supporting oppressive regimes. The Rothschilds financed monarchies and conservative governments that suppressed democratic movements, maintained rigid class hierarchies, and resisted social reforms. While the family could argue they were simply bankers serving clients without political judgment, critics noted their choices had real consequences for millions subject to the regimes they financed. Their general support for political stability and order often aligned them against revolutionary and democratic movements.[^35]

Conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds have proven remarkably durable, evolving across centuries and adapting to new contexts. Modern variants circulate on internet forums and social media, accusing the family of controlling central banks, orchestrating world wars, and manipulating global events from the shadows. These theories typically lack credible evidence and reflect classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and malevolence. However, their persistence indicates how the Rothschild name functions symbolically in certain political narratives, independent of the actual family's contemporary activities.[^36][^37]

## Personal Life

Mayer Amschel Rothschild married Gutle Schnapper in 1770, when he was 26 years old. Gutle, daughter of a respected money changer, proved an ideal partner for Mayer's ambitions. The marriage was reportedly happy and productive—the couple had ten children together: five sons and five daughters. Gutle was known for her practicality, frugality, and dedication to family, qualities that complemented Mayer's business focus. She outlived him by 37 years, dying in 1849 at the remarkable age of 96, having witnessed the family's transformation from ghetto merchants to international financial titans.[^38][^39]

Despite his growing wealth, Mayer Amschel maintained relatively modest personal habits, at least by the standards of his later descendants. He continued living in the Frankfurt ghetto even as his fortune expanded, though he eventually moved to a larger house there. This decision was partly practical—legal restrictions limited where Jews could reside—but also reflected his cautious nature and desire to avoid ostentatious displays that might attract unwanted attention or resentment. He dressed simply and avoided the elaborate consumption patterns of the nobility he served.[^40]

Contemporary accounts describe Mayer Amschel as intelligent, diplomatic, and extremely hardworking. He possessed the crucial ability to interact comfortably with both ghetto residents and aristocratic clients, adapting his manner to each context. With nobility, he displayed the deference expected of court agents while maintaining dignity; with fellow Jews, he remained engaged in community affairs and religious observances. This social flexibility was essential to navigating the rigid hierarchies of 18th-century German society.[^41]

Rothschild maintained his Jewish faith and observances throughout his life, attending synagogue regularly and supporting Jewish communal institutions. He served in various leadership roles within Frankfurt's Jewish community, using his growing influence to advocate for the community's interests. Religion provided not only spiritual meaning but also social networks and trust relationships crucial for his business—many of his initial agents and partners were fellow Jews connected through religious and communal ties.[^42]

As a father, Mayer Amschel was deeply invested in training his sons for the family business. He involved them in operations from young ages, teaching them financial skills, languages, and the diplomatic arts necessary for dealing with powerful clients. He insisted they work together rather than competing, emphasizing family unity as essential to success. This training proved remarkably effective—his five sons became legends in their own right, expanding the empire their father founded. His relationships with his daughters appear to have followed conventional patterns of his era, with marriages arranged to suitable Jewish families and their primary roles envisioned as wives and mothers rather than business partners.[^43][^44]

Contemporaries noted Rothschild's caution and risk management. Unlike some financiers who gambled on spectacular ventures, he preferred steady accumulation through reliable relationships and diversified activities. He maintained substantial reserves, avoided over-extension, and emphasized gathering information before making decisions. These personality traits translated directly into business practices that enabled the family to survive crises that destroyed more aggressive competitors.[^45]

His final years saw him increasingly delegating operations to his sons while maintaining overall strategic direction. He began experiencing health problems around 1810, though he continued working until shortly before his death. He died on September 19, 1812, at age 68, in Frankfurt. His death occurred as the Napoleonic Wars were reaching their climax, just before his family would achieve their greatest financial triumphs in the war's aftermath. In his will, he codified the principles that would govern the family business for generations, emphasizing unity, confidentiality, and the exclusion of non-family members from core operations.[^46][^47]

## Legacy

Mayer Amschel Rothschild's most obvious legacy is the financial dynasty bearing his name, which dominated international finance throughout the 19th century and remains active today. His five sons built on their father's foundation to create what was effectively the first multinational corporation—a coordinated network of banks operating across borders with shared information, capital, and strategy. At their peak in the mid-1800s, the Rothschilds were arguably the wealthiest family in the world, financing governments, railways, mining operations, and major industrial ventures across Europe and beyond.[^48][^49]

The family's influence extended beyond mere wealth into political and social realms. Rothschild descendants received noble titles from various European monarchies, married into aristocratic families, and became patrons of arts, sciences, and charitable causes. They financed major infrastructure projects including railways that connected Europe, supported scientific research, and built important art collections. Several Rothschilds served in parliaments and advised governments on economic policy. This social integration represented a remarkable transformation from Mayer Amschel's origins in the restricted Frankfurt ghetto.[^50]

Rothschild's business innovations influenced the development of modern international finance. The family pioneered techniques for moving capital across borders, managing currency risks, syndication of large bond issues among multiple investors, and using information networks to gain market advantages. Many practices that seem standard in contemporary global finance—coordinated operations across multiple countries, rapid communication between branches, diversification across sectors and regions—were refined and systematized by the Rothschilds based on Mayer Amschel's initial framework.[^51]

His emphasis on family unity and trust as business assets created a model that other commercial dynasties attempted to emulate, with varying success. The idea that family members, bound by blood and shared interest, could coordinate more effectively than unrelated partners influenced business organization in many sectors. The Rothschild family councils, where brothers or cousins would meet to coordinate strategy and resolve disputes, became templates for governance of family enterprises. However, few families proved able to maintain cohesion across multiple generations as successfully as the Rothschilds.[^52]

The Rothschild name became synonymous with wealth itself, entering popular culture and language as a shorthand for financial power. This symbolic status cuts both ways—the name appears in respectful contexts as representing business acumen and success, but also in antisemitic conspiracy theories as a code for alleged sinister Jewish control. The family has had to contend with their name being appropriated for ideological purposes having little to do with their actual activities, particularly in far-right and conspiracy theory circles. This unfortunate legacy reflects broader patterns of antisemitism more than anything specific to Mayer Amschel's actual conduct.[^53][^54]

In Frankfurt, Rothschild's legacy includes philanthropic institutions and Jewish communal organizations his family supported. Later Rothschilds funded hospitals, schools, housing for the poor, and cultural institutions. While Mayer Amschel himself operated on a more modest scale, his success enabled his descendants to become major philanthropists. The family maintained particular commitment to Jewish causes, supporting communities facing persecution and helping establish Jewish settlements in Palestine that contributed to the eventual founding of Israel.[^55]

For historians of Jewish history, Mayer Amschel represents a pivotal figure in the transition from medieval restrictions to modern integration. His success demonstrated that Jews could excel in finance and commerce when given opportunities, challenging antisemitic stereotypes while simultaneously, problematically, reinforcing associations between Jews and money that fueled other prejudices. His life occurred during the early stages of Jewish emancipation in Central Europe, and his family's trajectory illustrated both the possibilities and limitations of that process.[^56]

In the history of capitalism, Rothschild exemplifies the entrepreneurial merchant-banker who helped finance the industrial revolution and the construction of modern nation-states. The capital his family mobilized enabled governments to fund wars, built infrastructure that connected markets, and supported industrial enterprises that transformed economies. Whether one views this role positively (as facilitating progress and development) or critically (as enabling militarism and exploitative capitalism) depends on broader ideological perspectives, but the historical significance is undeniable.[^57]

Modern Rothschild descendants remain active in banking, wine production, and various business ventures, though the family no longer dominates global finance as it did in the 19th century. The rise of large institutional banks, changes in financial regulation, world wars that destroyed wealth and disrupted operations, and the simple passage of time have dispersed the concentrated power Mayer Amschel's immediate descendants once wielded. Nevertheless, the family remains wealthy and influential, with various branches pursuing different business interests while maintaining some coordination and shared identity.[^58]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Mayer Amschel Rothschild emphasize his remarkable achievement in rising from the severe constraints of the Frankfurt ghetto to establish one of history's most successful business enterprises. Historian Niall Ferguson, in his comprehensive study "The House of Rothschild," portrays Mayer Amschel as a financial genius whose innovations in international banking helped create the integrated capital markets that enabled modern economic development. Ferguson argues that the Rothschilds' ability to move capital efficiently across borders facilitated trade, industrial investment, and government finance in ways that promoted overall economic growth and prosperity.[^59][^60]

Supporters note Rothschild's role in financing the defeat of Napoleon, arguing that his network's support for the coalition against France contributed to preserving European independence from French imperial domination. The family's loans to Britain and other allied powers helped sustain their war efforts during crucial periods. From this perspective, the Rothschilds deserve credit as patriots who used financial means to support the cause of liberty against tyranny, even if they also profited handsomely from these activities.[^61]

Scholars of Jewish history often view Mayer Amschel as a pioneering figure who helped open paths for Jewish advancement in European society. Despite facing legal disabilities and social prejudice, he demonstrated that Jews could contribute to European economic life at the highest levels. His success challenged antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish inability to participate in "productive" economic activity, even as it paradoxically reinforced other stereotypes about Jewish financial acumen. Historians like Amos Elon and Frederic Morton emphasize how the Rothschild family's achievements provided inspiration and practical support for Jewish communities across Europe.[^62][^63]

Business historians credit Rothschild with pioneering organizational innovations that became standard practice. His creation of a multinational family business with coordinated operations across multiple countries, systematic information sharing, and unified strategic direction represented a major advance in business organization. The emphasis on maintaining liquid reserves, diversifying activities, and building redundant capabilities anticipated modern corporate risk management. These innovations had practical value beyond the Rothschild family, influencing how international commerce was conducted.[^64]

Some commentators appreciate Rothschild's personal qualities—his work ethic, intelligence, diplomatic skills, and ability to maintain relationships across cultural divides. Stories of his rise emphasize individual merit overcoming structural obstacles, fitting American-style narratives of self-made success. This perspective celebrates entrepreneurial talent and determination while perhaps underestimating the roles of luck, timing, and structural factors in his achievements.[^65]

Defenders address criticisms about financing multiple sides in conflicts by noting that maintaining political neutrality was standard practice for banking houses and actually served peaceful purposes. By being willing to serve different governments, bankers could facilitate negotiations, maintain communication channels during hostilities, and help arrange the financial settlements needed for peace. From this viewpoint, the Rothschilds' studied neutrality made them valuable intermediaries rather than cynical war profiteers.[^66]

Philanthropic activities by Rothschild descendants, enabled by wealth Mayer Amschel founded, receive praise from admirers. Later Rothschilds funded hospitals, schools, scientific research, and arts institutions across Europe. They supported Jewish communities facing persecution and contributed to Zionist settlement in Palestine. While Mayer Amschel himself operated on a smaller philanthropic scale, his creation of lasting wealth enabled these later contributions, which supporters credit to his legacy.[^67]

### Negative Views

Critics of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his legacy emphasize how concentrated financial power in private hands undermines democratic governance and public welfare. The Rothschild family's ability to influence government policies through control of public debt essentially gave unelected private bankers veto power over sovereign decisions. This plutocratic influence, critics argue, perverted democratic processes and ensured policies served creditor interests rather than ordinary citizens. The family's general support for conservative governments and opposition to revolutionary democratic movements reflected their interest in stability and debt repayment rather than human liberty or social justice.[^68]

Leftist historians criticize the Rothschilds as exemplars of parasitic finance capitalism that extracts wealth without creating genuine value. From Marxist perspectives, money-lending and financial manipulation constitute unproductive activities that siphon resources from workers and producers into the hands of financial middlemen. The family's immense wealth derived not from innovation or productive labor but from exploiting information advantages, political connections, and the desperation of governments needing loans. This critique sees financial capitalism generally—and the Rothschilds particularly—as obstacles to equitable economic development.[^69]

The family's willingness to finance any government able to repay debts, regardless of moral character, attracts ethical criticism. The Rothschilds provided capital to reactionary monarchies suppressing democratic movements, imperial powers conquering colonies, and regimes maintaining feudal inequalities. While defenders invoke professional neutrality, critics counter that financing oppression makes one complicit in it. The claim that business and morality occupy separate spheres merely rationalizes profiting from injustice. By this view, the Rothschilds prioritized profit over principle in ways that enabled substantial human suffering.[^70]

Historians critical of the family note their role in propagating and benefiting from the "gold standard" monetary system that dominated the 19th century. While the gold standard facilitated international trade and capital flows—activities the Rothschilds dominated—it also constrained governments' ability to respond to economic crises through monetary policy. This rigidity contributed to severe depressions and unemployment during downturns, as governments couldn't expand money supplies to stimulate recovery. The Rothschilds' extensive gold holdings and trading operations gave them vested interests in maintaining the gold standard despite its deflationary bias that harmed debtors and workers.[^71]

Some critics highlight the gap between the family's Jewish identity and their actual commitment to Jewish welfare. While the Rothschilds maintained religious observance and eventually supported Jewish causes, their primary loyalties were to their business interests and relationships with gentile elites. They generally opposed revolutionary movements that might have improved conditions for poor Jews, preferring gradual reform and stability. Critics argue this reflected class interests trumping ethnic solidarity—wealthy Jewish bankers had more in common with Christian aristocrats than with poor Jewish workers in the Pale of Settlement.[^72]

The Rothschild information network and courier system, while impressively sophisticated, operated in legal gray areas regarding customs duties, military regulations, and securities laws. The family's agents regularly evaded border controls, smuggled gold and documents across military lines, and exploited market-moving information before it became public. While such activities might be rationalized as necessary for business in chaotic times, they involved systematic evasion of laws and regulations designed to protect public interests. Modern insider trading and smuggling laws emerged partly from concerns about exactly these types of practices.[^73]

Feminist historians note that Mayer Amschel's patriarchal family structure, particularly the exclusion of daughters from business and inheritance, perpetuated gender inequality. While such arrangements were common in his era, they still merit criticism for denying opportunities to women based solely on sex. The Rothschild family's perpetuation of these norms for generations, long after some other families began including women in business affairs, reflected conservative gender politics that reinforced women's subordination.[^74]

Finally, while the antisemitic conspiracy theories surrounding the Rothschilds are largely false and reflect prejudice rather than fact, critics note that the family's actual secrecy and tendency toward behind-the-scenes influence provided some factual basis for suspicions. The Rothschilds deliberately cultivated mystery about their operations, maintained extensive confidentiality, and exercised political influence through private channels rather than public advocacy. While this doesn't justify antisemitic fantasies about world domination, it does explain why the family became a focus for anxieties about hidden power and unaccountable elites.[^75]
