## Summary

John Bordley Rawls (1921-2002) was one of the most influential political philosophers of the 20th century, best known for his groundbreaking work *A Theory of Justice* (1971), which revitalized normative political philosophy.[^1][^2] His theory of "justice as fairness" introduced revolutionary concepts including the "original position" and the "veil of ignorance" to argue for equal basic liberties and economic arrangements that benefit society's least advantaged members.[^3] Rawls spent most of his academic career at Harvard University, where he trained two generations of moral and political philosophers who came to dominate the field.[^4] His work sparked intense debates with libertarians, communitarians, and other critics, fundamentally reshaping Anglo-American liberal political philosophy and influencing legal theory, economics, and public policy discourse.[^5][^6]

## Early Life and Background

John Bordley Rawls was born on February 21, 1921, in Baltimore, Maryland, into a family of comfortable means.[^7] His father, William Lee Rawls, was a prominent attorney, while his mother, Anna Abell Stump, was a civic leader who served as president of the League of Women Voters' Baltimore chapter, helping to inspire Rawls's long-standing interest in women's rights.[^8][^9] He was the second of five children in the family, growing up in an environment that valued education and civic engagement.[^10]

Rawls's youth was marked by profound tragedy that would shape his philosophical outlook for life. In two successive years during his childhood, his two younger brothers contracted infectious diseases from him—diphtheria in one case and pneumonia in the other—and both died.[^11][^12] This devastating experience gave Rawls a vivid sense of the arbitrariness of fortune, a theme that would become central to his philosophical work on justice.[^13] The capriciousness of fate, the idea that one's life circumstances result largely from factors beyond one's control, became a foundational insight driving his theory of justice.

After attending the Kent School, a private preparatory school in western Connecticut, Rawls enrolled at Princeton University in 1939.[^14] At Princeton, he studied philosophy and received his undergraduate degree in 1943.[^15] His education was interrupted by World War II, during which he enlisted in the United States Army in February 1943 and was assigned to the Pacific theater.[^16] Rawls served as an infantryman with the 128th Infantry Regiment of the 32nd Infantry Division, experiencing combat in New Guinea, where he won a Bronze Star and received a Combat Infantryman Badge.[^17][^18]

His military service profoundly affected his worldview and religious beliefs. Rawls lost his Christian faith as an infantryman in World War II upon witnessing the capriciousness of death in combat and learning of the horrors of the Holocaust.[^19] In December 1944, his unit was deployed to Leyte in the Philippines, tasked with securing a strategic ridge near Limon against fierce Japanese resistance, where he served in the trenches under constant fire for many days.[^20] Following Japan's surrender, Rawls became part of General MacArthur's occupying army and was promoted to Sergeant.[^21] However, he became disillusioned with the military after seeing the aftermath of the atomic blast in Hiroshima, subsequently disobeying an order and being demoted back to private before leaving the military in January 1946.[^22]

## Rise to Prominence

After returning from military service, Rawls returned to Princeton as a graduate student in philosophy, receiving his Ph.D. in 1950.[^23] His dissertation advisor was the distinguished philosopher Walter Stanton.[^24] In 1950, he joined the Princeton faculty as an instructor, beginning his academic career in earnest.[^25] During the early 1950s, Rawls developed his initial ideas about justice and fairness, publishing several important articles that would later form the foundation of his magnum opus.

Rawls became an assistant professor at Cornell University in the fall of 1953, receiving tenure three years later.[^26] During the 1959-60 academic year, he served as a visiting professor at Harvard, and in 1960 was appointed as a professor in the humanities division at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[^27] Two years later, in 1962, Rawls returned to Harvard as a professor of philosophy, where he would remain until reaching mandatory retirement age in 1991, teaching for almost forty years.[^28][^29]

At Harvard, Rawls was named John Cowles Professor of Philosophy in 1975 and James Bryant Conant University Professor in 1979.[^30] Throughout his career, he devoted considerable attention to his teaching, focusing meticulously on great philosophers of the past—Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Mill, and others—always approaching them deferentially and with an eye to what students could learn from them.[^31][^32] He insisted that his students write only on important historical works rather than on his own theory or other contemporary works, demonstrating intellectual humility unusual among major philosophers.[^33]

The publication of *A Theory of Justice* in 1971 catapulted Rawls to international prominence. In 1990, Will Kymlicka wrote that "it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls's *A Theory of Justice* in 1971."[^34] The book set the parameters for debate from the moment it was published, fundamentally reshaping Anglo-American liberal political philosophy.[^35] Since its publication, *A Theory of Justice* has been translated into two dozen languages and sold more than two hundred thousand copies.[^36]

## Major Achievements

Rawls's most significant achievement was developing and articulating his theory of "justice as fairness," which offered a systematic alternative to utilitarianism and addressed the fundamental problem of distributive justice—the socially just distribution of goods in society.[^37][^38] His work introduced several revolutionary philosophical concepts that have become central to contemporary political theory.

### The Original Position and Veil of Ignorance

Rawls's argument for his principles of social justice employs a thought experiment called the "original position," in which people deliberately select what kind of society they would choose to live in if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy.[^39][^40] In this hypothetical situation, which corresponds to the state of nature in social contract theory, representatives of free and equal citizens are placed behind a "veil of ignorance"—they do not know their place in society, their class or social status, their fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities (intelligence, strength, and the like), or even their conception of the good.[^41][^42]

The veil of ignorance ensures that the parties in the original position are situated fairly with respect to one another, as no party can press for agreement on principles that will arbitrarily favor the particular citizen they represent.[^43] Rawls argued that their decisions would thus be guaranteed to be fair, and that rational people in such a position would choose principles that protect them against the worst possible outcomes, since they might end up occupying any position in society.[^44] As Rawls eloquently stated, "A just society is a society that if you knew everything about it, you'd be willing to enter it in a random place."[^45]

### Two Principles of Justice

From the original position, Rawls argued that rational individuals would select two fundamental principles of justice. The first principle guarantees that everyone should have equal basic liberties—freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of association, and other fundamental rights.[^46][^47] The second principle addresses economic and social inequalities, subdivided into two parts: fair equality of opportunity (positions and offices must be open to all under conditions of fair equality) and the difference principle.[^48][^49]

The difference principle, perhaps Rawls's most discussed contribution, states that economic inequalities are permissible only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society.[^50][^51] More specifically, it permits diverging from strict equality so long as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged materially better off than they would be under strict equality.[^52] In a society satisfying the difference principle, citizens know that their economy works to everyone's benefit, and that those who were lucky enough to be born with greater natural potential are not getting richer at the expense of those who were less fortunate.[^53]

Rawls arranged these principles in "lexical priority," meaning the liberty principle takes absolute priority over fair equality of opportunity, which in turn takes priority over the difference principle.[^54] This means basic liberties cannot be traded away for economic gains, reflecting Rawls's commitment to fundamental rights.

### Political Liberalism and Later Work

Rawls continued to develop and refine his theory throughout his career. In 1993, he published *Political Liberalism*, which continued and revised the ideas of justice as fairness presented in *A Theory of Justice* but changed its philosophical interpretation in a fundamental way.[^55][^56] This work was driven by his growing concern with the question of political stability in contemporary pluralist democracies where citizens are divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements.[^57]

*Political Liberalism* introduced the distinction between "comprehensive conceptions," which address all questions about how to live, and "political conceptions," which address only political questions.[^58] A political conception is "a moral conception," but one that concerns itself only with the basic structure of society and is conceptually unbiased so it can fit as a module in different comprehensive doctrines.[^59][^60] Rawls placed his hopes for social stability on an "overlapping consensus," in which citizens all endorse a core set of laws for different reasons, each supporting a political conception of justice for reasons internal to their own comprehensive doctrine.[^61][^62]

The work also developed the idea of "public reason"—the common reason of all citizens—providing doctrine-neutral grounds for adjudicating questions of basic justice.[^63][^64] This concept has been particularly influential in debates about the role of religious arguments in political discourse and the foundations of constitutional democracy.

In 1999, Rawls published *The Law of Peoples*, which extended the idea of a social contract to the Society of Peoples and laid out general principles that can and should be accepted by both liberal and non-liberal societies as the standard for regulating their behavior toward one another.[^65][^66] This work represented Rawls's attempt to develop principles of international justice and address questions of global distributive justice, war, and human rights.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his enormous influence, Rawls's work has been subject to sustained criticism from multiple philosophical traditions, sparking some of the most important debates in late 20th-century political philosophy.

### The Communitarian Critique

Modern-day communitarianism began as a critical reaction to Rawls's *A Theory of Justice*. Political philosophers such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel, Charles Taylor, and Michael Walzer disputed Rawls's assumption that the principal task of government is to secure and distribute fairly the liberties and economic resources individuals need to lead freely chosen lives.[^67][^68] Communitarian thinkers in the 1980s argued that Rawlsian liberalism rests on an overly individualistic conception of the self.[^69]

Michael Sandel questioned Rawls's claim for the priority of right over good, maintaining that liberals fail to recognize that the self is "embedded" in and partly constituted by communal commitments and values.[^70][^71] The idea of an unencumbered self at the core of the Kantian-Rawlsian theory of justice came under sustained attack.[^72] Whereas Rawls seemed to present his theory of justice as universally true, communitarians argued that standards of justice must be found in forms of life and traditions of particular societies and hence can vary from context to context.[^73][^74]

MacIntyre and Taylor argued that moral and political judgment depends on the language of reasons and the interpretive framework within which agents view their world, challenging Rawls's attempt to develop universal principles of justice.[^75] While some defenders of Rawls argue that the communitarian critique is based on a misunderstanding—that Rawls didn't intend the original position to depict what people are actually like or as an account of human psychology or the metaphysical nature of the self—the communitarian critique had a profound effect on Rawls and led him to make significant revisions in his later work.[^76][^77]

### The Libertarian Challenge

Three years after the appearance of *A Theory of Justice*, Robert Nozick published a libertarian response, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (1974), which argued that nothing more than a "minimal state" devoted to protecting people against crimes like assault, robbery, and fraud could be morally justified.[^78][^79] A large portion of Nozick's book was dedicated to refuting Rawls's theories, offering a witty and incisive critique of the difference principle.[^80]

Nozick's "Entitlement Theory of Justice" emphasized personal freedom and minimal state intervention, built on three ideas: justice in acquisition, justice in transfer, and justice in rectification.[^81][^82] He challenged the difference principle, arguing that it entails excessive state intervention and that redistributive policies infringe on individual property rights and liberty, undermining the moral integrity of free market exchanges.[^83][^84] Nozick refuted what he saw as the implausible claim that merely because members of a society benefit from social cooperation, its less-advantaged members are automatically entitled to a share in the earnings of their more successful peers.[^85]

The entitlement theory is historical and unpatterned, taking into account past actions and circumstances in determining whether a particular distribution is just, whereas Rawls's "justice as fairness" is both a patterned and an end-state theory of justice.[^86] Nozick's book won the 1975 National Book Award and was listed by the Times Literary Supplement as one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century, making the debate between Rawls and Nozick one of the most captivating in political theory.[^87][^88]

### Marxist and Socialist Critiques

From the left, Rawls has been criticized for attempting to provide a new kind of justification for the welfare state while leaving capitalist economic structures fundamentally intact.[^89] Some critics argue that Rawls was wrong to think we could have a just capitalism, contending that his theory fails to adequately address the exploitation inherent in capitalist relations of production.[^90] These critics maintain that Rawls's difference principle, while seemingly egalitarian, ultimately legitimizes significant inequalities and does not challenge the fundamental power imbalances in capitalist societies.

### Other Criticisms

Rawls's theory has also been criticized for its highly abstract nature and its reliance on ideal theory rather than addressing non-ideal circumstances and injustices in the real world. Some critics argue that the original position and veil of ignorance are too removed from actual human psychology and social conditions to provide practical guidance for addressing concrete injustices. Others have questioned whether the principles Rawls claims would be chosen in the original position would actually be selected by rational agents under those conditions, or whether other principles might be equally or more rational.

## Personal Life

In 1949, John Rawls married Margaret Warfield Fox, and together they raised four children: Anne Warfield (born 1950), Robert Lee (born 1954), Alexander Emory (born 1955), and Elizabeth Fox (born 1957).[^91][^92] Despite his international fame as one of the 20th century's preeminent philosophers, Rawls lived a remarkably withdrawn life, spending most of his time as an academic and family person, shunning the public spotlight.[^93][^94]

Those who knew Rawls described him as a deeply modest and humble individual, characterized by intellectual generosity and genuine interest in the ideas of others. His teaching style reflected these qualities—he approached great philosophers of the past with deference and respect, modeling for his students how to engage seriously with ideas different from one's own.[^95] Students and colleagues remembered him as someone who took their arguments seriously and responded thoughtfully, never dismissing opposing views out of hand.

Rawls's personality stood in stark contrast to the stereotype of the brilliant but arrogant philosopher. He was known for his kindness, patience with students, and willingness to engage in serious philosophical dialogue with anyone genuinely interested in ideas.[^96] His modesty extended to his own work—he continually revised and refined his theories in response to criticism, showing an unusual willingness to acknowledge potential weaknesses in his arguments and to modify his views.

The trauma of his childhood—losing two brothers to diseases they contracted from him—left a lasting psychological mark. This experience of arbitrary misfortune and the guilt associated with it may have contributed to his deep conviction that a just society must not allow people's life prospects to be determined by morally arbitrary factors like the circumstances of their birth or natural talents.[^97] Similarly, his World War II experiences, particularly witnessing the aftermath of Hiroshima and the Holocaust, reinforced his sense of the fragility of civilization and the moral urgency of establishing just institutions.

In 1995, Rawls suffered the first of several strokes, which severely impeded his ability to continue working, though he was nevertheless able to complete *The Law of Peoples*.[^98] Rawls died from heart failure at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, on November 24, 2002, at age 81.[^99] He was survived by his wife Margaret, their four children, and four grandchildren.[^100]

## Legacy

John Rawls's legacy in political philosophy and beyond is difficult to overstate. He has been described as one of the most influential political philosophers of the 20th century, and his work continues to shape contemporary debates in moral and political theory, law, economics, and public policy.[^101][^102]

### Transformation of Political Philosophy

The "recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls's *A Theory of Justice* in 1971," as Will Kymlicka noted in 1990.[^103] Rawls completely transformed how political philosophy was done and the kinds of questions philosophers asked, showing that philosophy could be ambitious and dream big.[^104] His work is widely regarded as the most influential western work of political theory published since 1945, playing a significant role in revitalizing political philosophy as an academic discipline.[^105]

Before Rawls, many philosophers believed that normative political philosophy was dead or impossible, that questions of justice could not be addressed philosophically in any rigorous way. Rawls demonstrated that systematic, rigorous philosophical work on questions of justice and political morality was not only possible but could be intellectually ambitious and practically relevant.[^106] Nearly every contemporary scholarly discussion of justice references *A Theory of Justice*, which set the parameters for debate from the moment it was published.[^107][^108]

### Influence on Students and Scholarship

During his nearly forty years at Harvard, Rawls trained some of the most influential philosophers in the world today, including Thomas Nagel, T.M. Scanlon, Joshua Cohen, and many others who have gone on to careers teaching philosophy and political theory at prestigious universities.[^109][^110] He trained two generations of moral philosophers who went on to dominate the field.[^111] As a mentor to countless graduate students, Rawls inspired many who have become influential interpreters of philosophical traditions.[^112]

The Leibniz Prize-winning political philosopher Rainer Forst was advised by both Rawls and Jürgen Habermas in completing his Ph.D., illustrating Rawls's international influence.[^113] In a 2008 national survey of political theorists, Rawls was voted first on the list of "Scholars Who Have Had the Greatest Impact on Political Theory in the Past 20 Years."[^114]

### Practical and Legal Influence

Rawls's philosophical work has exerted enormous impact not only on contemporary moral and political philosophy but also on public political discourse.[^115] He is frequently cited by courts of law in the United States and Canada and referred to by practicing politicians.[^116] His concepts—particularly the original position, veil of ignorance, and difference principle—have entered broader public discourse about justice, fairness, and the proper role of government.

The vitality and breadth of contemporary political philosophy are in large part indebted to Rawls, whose work opened up new avenues of inquiry and established new standards of rigor and systematicity.[^117] His rehabilitation of social contract theory, his synthesis of Kantian moral philosophy with contemporary analytical methods, and his attempt to reconcile liberty and equality have all proven enormously influential.

### Recognition and Honors

Rawls received numerous prestigious awards and honors during his lifetime. In 1999, he received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal, which was awarded by President Bill Clinton in recognition of Rawls as "one of the 20th century's most influential political philosophers, widely read among political scientists, economists and legal theorists for his views on justice, basic rights and equal opportunity."[^118][^119][^120] He also received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award in 1972, was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1974, and became a Member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1992.[^121] Asteroid 16561 Rawls is named in his honor.[^122]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and defenders of Rawls's work emphasize its systematic rigor, moral seriousness, and enduring relevance to contemporary debates about justice and political legitimacy. Many view *A Theory of Justice* as the most important work of political philosophy in the 20th century, comparable in significance to the great works of the canon.[^123] The book is "widely and justly regarded as this century's most important work of political philosophy," demonstrating unprecedented sophistication in addressing fundamental questions of distributive justice.[^124]

Supporters argue that Rawls successfully reconciled competing values of liberty and equality, showing how a society could be both free and fair.[^125] His principles of justice provide a compelling framework for evaluating social institutions and policies, offering practical guidance while maintaining philosophical rigor. The original position and veil of ignorance represent powerful heuristic devices for thinking about fairness, helping people step outside their particular interests and consider justice from an impartial standpoint.[^126]

Defenders note that while Rawls may have succeeded in responding to his egalitarian, socialist, and libertarian critics, his willingness to revise his theory in response to communitarian and other critiques demonstrates intellectual integrity and genuine philosophical engagement.[^127] His later work on political liberalism, overlapping consensus, and public reason addresses real challenges facing diverse democratic societies, providing resources for thinking about stability, legitimacy, and pluralism.[^128]

Many philosophers and legal theorists praise Rawls for his intellectual generosity, his careful attention to the history of philosophy, and his ability to engage seriously with opposing views.[^129] His teaching and mentorship shaped generations of scholars, and his example of how to do philosophy—with rigor, humility, and moral seriousness—continues to influence the profession.[^130]

### Negative Views

Critics from various perspectives maintain that Rawls's theory suffers from fundamental flaws. Libertarians like Nozick argue that any attempt to impose a patterned distribution of goods, even one justified by the difference principle, violates individual rights and legitimate entitlements.[^131] They contend that Rawls's theory provides insufficient protection for property rights and economic liberty, and that his principles would require unacceptable levels of state coercion to implement.[^132]

Communitarians maintain that Rawls's theory rests on an impoverished conception of the self and community, failing to recognize how individuals are constituted by their social roles and communal attachments.[^133] They argue that his attempt to develop universal principles of justice ignores the ways in which justice is necessarily particular to specific communities and traditions.[^134] Some communitarian critics contend that Rawls's emphasis on individual rights and his priority of the right over the good undermines the common good and social solidarity necessary for genuine community.[^135]

From the left, Marxist and socialist critics argue that Rawls's theory legitimizes capitalism and fails to address fundamental exploitation and domination inherent in capitalist economic relations.[^136] They maintain that the difference principle, while seemingly egalitarian, would still permit vast inequalities and would not challenge the structural power imbalances that characterize capitalist societies.[^137] Some argue that Rawls's focus on distributive justice neglects questions of production, worker control, and the organization of economic life.[^138]

Feminist critics have argued that Rawls's theory, particularly in its original formulation, inadequately addresses gender justice and the gendered division of labor within families.[^139] Some contend that the original position fails to ensure that parties would choose principles that protect against patriarchal oppression and gender-based injustice.

More broadly, critics across the political spectrum have questioned the practical applicability of Rawls's highly abstract theory. Some argue that ideal theory, which Rawls primarily engaged in, provides insufficient guidance for addressing actual injustices and non-ideal circumstances.[^140] Others question whether the psychological assumptions underlying the original position are plausible or whether the principles Rawls claims would be chosen would actually be selected by rational agents.[^141]
