## Overview
The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to prop up a communist government facing rebellion. They were met with fierce resistance from the Mujahideen, who utilized guerrilla tactics and foreign aid.

## Outcome
The war became a "quagmire" for the Soviets, often compared to the U.S. war in Vietnam. The Soviet withdrawal in 1989 contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
