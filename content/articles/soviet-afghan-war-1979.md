## Overview

The Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989) is often called "The Soviet Union's Vietnam." It began with a Christmas Day invasion to prop up a communist client government in Kabul and ended in a humiliating withdrawal that contributed significantly to the collapse of the Soviet Union itself. The Soviets controlled the cities, but the rural areas were controlled by the **Mujahideen**—Islamic guerrilla fighters supported by the US, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and China.

## Operation Storm-333

The war started with a special forces raid.
Soviet Spetsnaz (Alpha Group) stormed the Tajbeg Palace in Kabul, assassinating the Afghan President Hafizullah Amin (whom they suspected of CIAD ties, ironically) and replacing him with Babrak Karmal.
The Soviets thought they would be there for 6 months to stabilize the country. They stayed for 9 years.

## The Stinger Missile

For years, Soviet **Mi-24 Hind** helicopter gunships dominated the battlefield. They were "flying tanks" that terrorized villages.
**The Turning Point (1986):**
The CIA, under Charlie Wilson's urging (Operation Cyclone), began supplying the Mujahideen with shoulder-fired **FIM-92 Stinger** missiles.
Suddenly, the guerrillas could shoot down Soviet aircraft. The Soviets lost air superiority. The cost of the war in blood and treasure skyrocketed.

## The Human Cost

**Soviet Union:** ~15,000 soldiers killed, 50,000 wounded. The return of "Zinc Boys" (dead soldiers in zinc coffins) fueled anti-war sentiment in Russia.
**Afghanistan:** ~1 to 2 million civilians killed. Millions more became refugees in Pakistan and Iran. The country was destroyed, its infrastructure obliterated.

## Legacy: The Blowback

The US poured billions into training and arming Islamic fundamentalists to kill communists.
Among the foreign fighters who flocked to Afghanistan was a wealthy Saudi named **Osama bin Laden**.
The networks, training, and weapons left behind formed the basis of **Al-Qaeda** and the **Taliban**.
When the Soviets left in 1989, the West lost interest. Afghanistan descended into civil war, creating the vacuum that led to 9/11.
