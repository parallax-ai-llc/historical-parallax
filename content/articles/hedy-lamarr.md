## Summary

Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who co-invented frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology during World War II. Her patent, developed with composer George Antheil, was a precursor to technologies used in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. Despite being one of the biggest movie stars of her era, her scientific contributions were not recognized until decades later. She was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.
