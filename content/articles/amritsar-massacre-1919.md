## 1. Introduction: The End of Moral Authority
The **Amritsar Massacre** (Jallianwala Bagh Massacre) of April 13, 1919, was the decisive turning point in British-Indian relations. In the span of ten minutes, British troops fired 1,650 rounds into an unarmed crowd trapped in a walled garden, killing hundreds. The brutality, combined with the unrepentant attitude of the British command, shattered the myth of benevolent colonial rule and transformed the Indian independence movement from a demand for home rule into a demand for total severance from the British Empire.

## 2. Context: The Rowlatt Act and Unrest
Background tension in Punjab was extreme in 1919.
*   **The Rowlatt Act:** Passed in March 1919, this act indefinitely extended wartime emergency measures, allowing the British to imprison Indians without trial for up to two years. It was dubbed the "Black Act."
*   **Gandhi's Response:** Mahatma Gandhi called for a nationwide *Satyagraha* (civil disobedience).
*   **Amritsar Riots:** On April 10, the British arrested two popular leaders, Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satya Pal. In response, a crowd marched on the Deputy Commissioner's residence. The police fired on the crowd, killing several. The mob retaliated by burning British banks and killing five Europeans. A missionary, **Marcella Sherwood**, was beaten and left for dead.
*   **Martial Law:** Civil administration panicked and handed the city over to **Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer** on April 11. He immediately banned all public gatherings, but the proclamation was read only in select parts of the city.

## 3. April 13, 1919: The Trap
April 13 was **Baisakhi**, the Sikh New Year and harvest festival. Thousands of villagers from the surrounding countryside poured into Amritsar, unaware of the ban on meetings.
*   **The Bagh:** Jallianwala Bagh was a public garden of 6–7 acres, surrounded on all sides by high brick walls and houses. It had only five narrow entrances, most of which were locked or blocked.
*   **The Crowd:** By late afternoon, a crowd of 15,000 to 20,000 had gathered. Many were peaceful pilgrims; others were listening to speeches condemning the Rowlatt Act.

## 4. The Massacre (5:30 PM)
General Dyer arrived with 50 riflemen (25 Gurkhas and 25 Baluchis, armed with .303 Lee-Enfields) and two armored cars with mounted machine guns.
*   **The Geometry:** The armored cars were too wide to fit through the main entrance alley. Dyer left them outside and marched his riflemen in.
*   **The Formation:** He deployed his men on a raised bank blocking the main exit—the only viable escape route.
*   **The Order:** Without giving a single warning to disperse, Dyer ordered "Fire."
*   **The Slaughter:** The crowd panicked. Dyer directed his soldiers to aim at the densest sections of the crowd, particularly at the exits where people were crushing each other to escape.
*   **Minutes of Terror:** The firing continued for **10 to 15 minutes**. A total of **1,650 rounds** were fired. Dyer testified later that he only stopped because his ammunition was running low.
*   **The Martyrs' Well:** Hundreds leapt into the large open well in the garden to escape the bullets. 120 bodies were later recovered from the well alone.

## 5. The "Crawling Order" and Aftermath
Dyer strictly enforced a curfew. The wounded were left in the garden all night, crying for water, as anyone bringing aid was liable to be shot.
*   **The Crawling Order:** To punish the city for the assault on Marcella Sherwood, Dyer designated the street where she fell (Kucha Kurrichhan) a crawling lane. Any Indian wishing to pass had to crawl on their stomach. Soldiers punished those who raised their knees or buttocks with rifle butts.
*   **Floggings:** Public whipping booths were set up to punish anyone who didn't salaam (bow) to British officers.

## 6. The Reaction: "The Butcher of Amritsar"
*   **Churchill's Speech:** Winston Churchill sanctioned the event as "monstrous" and "an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation."
*   **The Hunter Commission (1920):** A committee interrogated Dyer. He was unapologetic.
    *   *Question:* "I think you had an opportunity to disperse the crowd without firing?"
    *   *Dyer:* "I could have dispersed them for some time then they would all come back and laugh at me, and I would have made what I consider a fool of myself."
    *   He stated his intent was to produce a **"moral effect"** of terror throughout the Punjab.
*   **The Verdict:** Dyer was relieved of his command but faced no criminal charges.
*   **The "Savior":** The House of Lords praised him. The conservative *Morning Post* raised £26,000 for him, labeling him "The Saviour of the Punjab." This glorification infuriated India.

## 7. Revenge: Udham Singh
**Udham Singh**, a teenager who was in the Bagh carrying water to the crowd, was injured. He swore revenge.
*   **The Assassin:** Singh joined the revolution Ghadar Party and traveled to London.
*   **The Shot:** On **March 13, 1940** (21 years later), Singh entered Caxton Hall in London and shot **Sir Michael O'Dwyer**, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab who had approved Dyer's actions (Dyer had already died of a stroke).
*   **The End:** Singh was hanged, but his act was celebrated in India as the final closing of the wound.

## 8. Legacy
*   **Gandhi:** The massacre converted Gandhi from a moderate cooperator to a staunch non-cooperator. He returned his Kaiser-i-Hind medal and launched the Non-Cooperation Movement.
*   **Tagore:** Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced his Knighthood, writing to the Viceroy that "badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation."
*   **Beginning of the End:** Historians agree that Amritsar was the moment the British Empire began to fall in India.
