## Summary

Lambertus Nicodemus Palar (1900-1981), also known as "Babe" Palar or L.N. Palar, was Indonesia's first representative to the United Nations and a pivotal figure in securing international recognition for Indonesian independence. Born in Rurukan, Tomohon, North Sulawesi, Palar transformed from a Dutch Social Democratic politician and anti-Nazi resistance fighter into one of Indonesia's most effective diplomatic advocates. His eloquent arguments before the UN Security Council during the Indonesian National Revolution helped turn global opinion against Dutch colonial efforts, ultimately contributing to Indonesia's sovereignty in 1949 and UN membership in 1950. Declared a National Hero of Indonesia posthumously in 2013, Palar's career embodied the intersection of Indonesian nationalism, international diplomacy, and anti-colonial struggle.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Lambertus Nicodemus Palar was born on June 5, 1900, in Rurukan, a village near Tomohon in North Sulawesi, to Gerrit Palar and Jacoba Lumanauw.[^3] He came from the Minahasa ethnic group, a predominantly Christian community in northern Sulawesi known for its early adoption of Western education under Dutch colonial rule. This background provided Palar with opportunities for advanced education unavailable to most Indonesians at the time.

Palar's early education followed a typical pattern for privileged Minahasan students. He attended Meisjes School (1908-1914) in Tomohon, followed by Hoofd School (1915-1916) in Tondano, and then Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO) (1916-1919).[^4] His educational journey then took him to Java, where he attended high school at the Algemeene Middelbare School (AMS) in Yogyakarta. During this period, he stayed with Sam Ratulangi, a prominent Minahasan educator and nationalist who would later become a National Hero of Indonesia.[^5] This mentorship proved formative, exposing the young Palar to nationalist ideas and connecting him to networks that would shape his political consciousness.

In 1922, Palar began studies at the Technical University (Technische Hoogeschool) in Bandung, which later became the prestigious Bandung Institute of Technology. Here, he became acquainted with Sukarno, the future first president of Indonesia, and other Indonesian nationalists who were organizing against Dutch colonial rule.[^6] This connection would prove significant throughout Palar's life, establishing relationships that would define Indonesia's independence movement.

However, a severe illness forced Palar to abandon his technical studies and return to Minahasa to recover. Undeterred, he restarted his education at the faculty of law (Rechts Hoogeschool) in Batavia (now Jakarta), where he joined Jong Minahasa (Young Minahasa), a regional youth organization that was part of the broader Indonesian youth movement.[^7] This period solidified his commitment to the nationalist cause while giving him legal training that would serve him well in diplomatic negotiations.

---

## Rise to Power

Palar's path to diplomatic prominence was unconventional, taking him first through Dutch politics before he became Indonesia's voice on the world stage. In 1928, he moved to the Netherlands to continue his studies at the University of Amsterdam.[^8] This period abroad coincided with growing momentum for Indonesian independence, and Palar became increasingly involved in political activism.

In 1930, Palar joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiders Partij, or SDAP) shortly after the party convened a Colonial Congress that voted to unconditionally recognize the right of national independence for the Dutch Indies.[^9] This progressive stance aligned with Palar's nationalist convictions while allowing him to work within the Dutch political system. By October 1933, he had risen to become secretary of the Colonial Commission of the SDAP and the Netherlands' Trade Union Federation (Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen, or NVV).[^10]

During World War II, Palar demonstrated remarkable courage by joining the anti-Nazi underground resistance movement alongside his wife, Johanna Petronella "Yoke" Volmers.[^11] During the German occupation, when he could not work for the SDAP, he was employed at the Van der Waals Laboratorium, maintaining cover while engaging in resistance activities.[^12]

After the war, Palar's political star rose further when he was elected to the Lower House (Tweede Kamer) of the Dutch parliament, representing the newly established Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid, or PvdA), which had emerged from the SDAP.[^13] However, his tenure as a Dutch parliamentarian was destined to be brief.

On July 20, 1947, the Dutch parliament voted to authorize military action against the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia—the so-called "police actions" that were actually full-scale military operations. Palar faced a moment of decision that would define his legacy. The very next day, July 21, 1947, he resigned from both parliament and the Labour Party in protest.[^14] This principled stand cost him his political career in the Netherlands but opened the door to his greatest achievements as Indonesia's diplomatic champion.

Being assigned by his party on a fact-finding mission to Indonesia, Palar met with leaders of the Indonesian National Revolution, including President Sukarno, renewing connections from his student days.[^15] He then established himself in New York, working at the heart of international diplomacy at UN headquarters according to President Sukarno's directive to serve as Indonesia's spokesman at the UN beginning in 1947.[^16]

## Major Achievements

Palar's greatest accomplishments came through his skillful advocacy for Indonesian independence on the world stage, particularly at the United Nations. His diplomatic efforts during this critical period helped transform Indonesia from a struggling revolutionary republic into a recognized sovereign nation.

### Advocacy at the United Nations (1947-1950)

During the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, Palar argued Indonesia's case at the UN and Security Council despite having only "observer" status, as Indonesia was not yet a UN member.[^17] This required exceptional diplomatic skill—making Indonesia's voice heard without the formal standing accorded to member states. In October 1947, Sjahrir stepped down as head of the Republican delegation, and Palar assumed the position of ambassador-at-large.[^18]

When the Netherlands launched Operation Product on July 20, 1947—the first "police action"—India and Australia brought the matter before the UN Security Council on July 31, 1947.[^19] Palar's advocacy contributed to the Security Council's August 1, 1947 resolution demanding a ceasefire, supported by the United States.[^20] On August 25, the Security Council passed a resolution establishing a Committee of Good Offices to help resolve the dispute peacefully.[^21]

Following the second Dutch "police action" in December 1948, Palar stood before the Security Council to plead for international intervention. His eloquent arguments helped mobilize international condemnation of Dutch actions, contributing to the Security Council's denunciation of the Netherlands and ultimately leading to the Roem-Van Roijen Agreement and the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference.[^22] On December 27, 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty.[^23]

### Indonesia's UN Membership

Indonesia was admitted as the 60th member state of the United Nations on September 28, 1950.[^24] Addressing the General Assembly as Indonesia's first official ambassador to the UN, Palar delivered a historic speech thanking supporters of the Indonesian cause and pledging that Indonesia would fulfill its obligations as a member state.[^25] In his formal letter dated September 25, 1950, to the Secretary-General, Palar declared Indonesia's acceptance of obligations under the UN Charter.[^26]

### Ambassadorial Career

Palar's diplomatic service extended far beyond the UN. He served as Indonesian ambassador to India, where he continued building relationships crucial to Indonesia's non-aligned foreign policy.[^27] From 1957 to 1962, he served as ambassador to Canada, where his daughter Maria married Sardar Indrajeet Singh in 1957.[^28] He then returned to the UN as ambassador from 1962 until 1965.[^29]

Palar also held ambassadorships in East Germany and the Soviet Union during the 1960s, representing Indonesia's efforts to maintain balanced relationships during the Cold War.[^30] When Indonesia withdrew from the UN in January 1965 due to the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, Palar defended this controversial decision. After Suharto's rise to power in 1966, Indonesia requested resumption of UN membership on September 10, 1966, with the message delivered by Palar to the Secretary-General.[^31] Indonesia returned to the UN on September 29, 1966, after an 18-month absence.[^32]

His final posting was as ambassador to the United States, a position he held until his retirement from foreign service in 1968.[^33]

### National Hero Recognition

On November 8, 2013, more than three decades after his death, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono declared Palar a National Hero of Indonesia, together with Rajiman Wediodiningrat and T. B. Simatupang.[^34] This highest-level Indonesian honor recognized his critical role in securing independence through diplomatic means.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Palar's diplomatic career was not without controversy, particularly during the tumultuous final years of Sukarno's Guided Democracy period.

### Indonesia's UN Withdrawal (1965)

The most significant controversy of Palar's career involved Indonesia's withdrawal from the United Nations in January 1965. When Malaysia was elected to the UN Security Council on December 29, 1964, President Sukarno announced on New Year's Day 1965 that Indonesia would withdraw if Malaysia took its seat.[^35] On January 7, 1965, Sukarno followed through on this threat, making Indonesia the first and only country to voluntarily withdraw from the UN.[^36]

Palar defended this decision, emphasizing that the withdrawal protested the UN's failure to address what Indonesia viewed as Malaysia's "illegitimacy" as a neo-colonial creation.[^37] Critics, including Western diplomats and later scholars, viewed Palar's unwavering support as enabling Sukarno's increasingly erratic foreign policy adventurism. The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation (Konfrontasi), which Indonesia pursued from 1963 to 1966, resulted in over 500 deaths and significant regional instability.[^38]

Contemporary observers noted that Indonesia's withdrawal reflected its diplomatic isolation but also removed a potential avenue for mediated settlement of the Malaysia dispute.[^39] The policy strained Indonesia's economy through military expenditures at a time when the country was already experiencing economic crisis.[^40]

### Enabling Sukarno's Foreign Policy

Some historians have criticized Palar for his loyalty to Sukarno's increasingly radical foreign policy during the early 1960s. As Indonesia moved closer to the People's Republic of China and pursued confrontational policies toward Malaysia and Western powers, Palar's diplomatic skills were employed in defending positions that isolated Indonesia internationally.[^41] Critics argue that a more independent-minded diplomat might have counseled restraint rather than lending credibility to policies that ultimately harmed Indonesian interests.

### Limited Public Criticism

Unlike some diplomatic figures who spoke out against policies they disagreed with, Palar maintained loyalty to Indonesian presidents throughout his career. While this loyalty reflected the diplomatic norm of representing one's government regardless of personal views, it also meant that Palar's considerable diplomatic talents were sometimes deployed in defense of questionable policies.[^42]

### The Question of Timing

Palar's retirement in 1968, just as Indonesia under Suharto's New Order was rebuilding its international relationships, came relatively early—he was only 68 years old and still possessed considerable diplomatic experience.[^43] Some observers have wondered whether differences with the new regime's approach led to his departure, though no public statements suggest acrimony.

---

## Personal Life

Lambertus Nicodemus Palar married Johanna Petronella Volmers, known as "Yoke," in 1935.[^44] Johanna worked as a reporter for Reuters, bringing her own professional accomplishments to the marriage.[^45] Their partnership proved strong through the challenges of World War II, when both participated in the anti-Nazi underground resistance, and through Palar's demanding diplomatic career that took the family to postings around the world.

The couple had three children: Maria Elisabeth (known as "Noni"), who married Sardar Indrajeet Singh in Canada in 1957 when Palar was serving as ambassador there; Maesi Martowardojo; and Bintoar Palar.[^46] The family maintained connections to both Indonesian and Dutch culture, reflecting Palar's own bicultural experience.

Colleagues remembered Palar by his nickname "Babe," suggesting an approachable personality despite his formal diplomatic role.[^47] His effectiveness as a diplomat stemmed partly from his ability to build personal relationships across cultural and political divides—a skill honed during his years in the Netherlands and refined through his resistance work during the Nazi occupation.

Palar's Christian faith, rooted in his Minahasan background, remained important throughout his life. The Minahasa region had been substantially Christianized during the 19th century, and this religious identity distinguished Minahasans from the Muslim majority in Indonesia.[^48] Yet Palar successfully navigated Indonesian nationalism's diverse religious landscape, working effectively with Muslim nationalist leaders like Sukarno and representing a republic founded on the principle of Pancasila, which recognized multiple religions.

His connection to his Minahasan heritage remained strong. The naming of Jalan Babe Palar (Babe Palar Street) in Tomohon, where the Minahasa Conference headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is located, reflects the region's recognition of his achievements.[^49] He maintained relationships with other prominent Minahasans, including Sam Ratulangi, who had mentored him during his youth.[^50]

Palar spent his retirement years in Jakarta, where he died on February 13, 1981, at the age of 80.[^51] He was survived by his wife Yoke and their three children, leaving a legacy that would be formally recognized three decades later with his designation as a National Hero of Indonesia.

## Legacy

Lambertus Nicodemus Palar's legacy extends across multiple dimensions of Indonesian history—as a diplomat, independence fighter, and symbol of principled political courage. His impact on Indonesian diplomacy and international relations continues to resonate decades after his death.

### Pioneer of Indonesian Diplomacy

Palar established the template for Indonesian diplomacy during the republic's formative years. Working from a position of weakness—representing a revolutionary government not yet recognized by most nations—he demonstrated how skillful advocacy, moral arguments, and strategic relationship-building could advance national interests. His success in securing international support for Indonesian independence despite Indonesia's lack of formal UN membership showed that diplomatic effectiveness depends not merely on power but on persuasion and principle.[^52]

Future Indonesian diplomats built on the foundation Palar laid. His emphasis on multilateral engagement, non-alignment, and anti-colonialism became enduring features of Indonesian foreign policy. The diplomatic service he helped create went on to play crucial roles in the Bandung Conference (1955), the Non-Aligned Movement, and Indonesia's eventual emergence as a regional leader through ASEAN.[^53]

### Symbol of Principled Choice

Palar's resignation from the Dutch parliament in protest of military action against Indonesia became a defining moment in his life story—one that exemplifies choosing conscience over career advancement. In 1947, he held a comfortable position as a member of parliament in the Netherlands, with prospects for continued advancement in Dutch politics. His decision to abandon this security and stand with the Indonesian independence movement, even though it meant becoming an advocate for a government considered rebellious by international law at the time, demonstrates extraordinary moral courage.[^54]

This aspect of his legacy has made him an inspirational figure in Indonesian history education. His story is taught as an example of how individuals from privileged positions can use their advantages to fight for justice rather than maintain the status quo.[^55]

### Minahasan Pride and Representation

Within the Minahasan community, Palar holds special significance as a representative of their contributions to Indonesian independence and nationhood. Along with Sam Ratulangi and other Minahasan nationalists, Palar demonstrated that the Christian minorities of eastern Indonesia played vital roles in the independence movement and the republic's early development.[^56] This counters narratives that frame Indonesian nationalism as exclusively Java-centric or Muslim-dominated.

The recognition of his legacy in Tomohon through street naming and his eventual designation as a National Hero helps maintain Minahasan identity and pride within the larger Indonesian nation.[^57]

### International Recognition

Palar's diplomatic work earned respect beyond Indonesia. His eloquent advocacy at the United Nations during the decolonization era contributed to establishing norms around self-determination and opposing colonial violence. Scholars of decolonization and UN history recognize his contributions to the broader anti-colonial movement that reshaped the international system after World War II.[^58]

The National Library of Australia holds materials on "Lambertus Nicodemus 'Babe' Palar, the first Indonesian Ambassador to the United Nations," reflecting international scholarly interest in his diplomatic career.[^59]

### Complex Historical Assessment

Historian George Kahin published "In Memoriam: L. N. Palar" in Indonesia journal in 1981, shortly after Palar's death, indicating scholarly attention to his significance.[^60] Later historical assessments have sought to understand both his achievements in securing independence and his role during more controversial periods, particularly the Sukarno era's final years.

Palar's legacy reminds us that diplomatic careers often involve serving governments through both their wise and unwise policies, and that the same skills that advance just causes can also be employed in more questionable pursuits. His life thus offers lessons not only about diplomatic effectiveness but about the moral complexities inherent in representing state power.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and scholars who focus on Indonesia's independence struggle generally hold Palar in high regard, viewing him as one of the most effective diplomatic advocates for decolonization in the post-World War II era.

Dr. Bonnie Triyana, editor of Historia magazine, described Palar as someone who "served his country during its early struggles and conflicts and battled for its freedom in the diplomatic arena."[^61] This assessment emphasizes Palar's role during the revolutionary period when Indonesia's very existence as an independent nation hung in the balance. His ability to navigate the UN system and build international support despite lacking formal diplomatic status demonstrated extraordinary skill and commitment.

Scholars of Indonesian foreign policy note that Palar helped establish diplomatic approaches that would characterize Indonesian foreign policy for decades: active in international forums, supportive of anti-colonial movements, committed to multilateralism, and emphasizing moral arguments alongside practical considerations.[^62] His work at the UN set precedents for Indonesia's later leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement and its advocacy for developing nations' interests.

The Cambridge Core journal Itinerario published research examining "The Republic at the Table, with Decolonisation on the Agenda: The United Nations Security Council and the Question of Indonesian Representation, 1946–1947," which analyzed Palar's crucial role in securing Indonesian representation and voice at the UN during the independence struggle.[^63] This scholarly attention reflects recognition of his significance in decolonization history.

Within Indonesia, Palar's 2013 designation as a National Hero represents the highest official recognition of his contributions. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's decision to award this honor alongside Rajiman Wediodiningrat and T. B. Simatupang placed Palar among the republic's most honored figures.[^64] Indonesian history education presents him as a model of diplomatic skill, principled action, and dedication to national independence.

The Minahasan community particularly celebrates Palar as one of their most distinguished sons, alongside Sam Ratulangi and other Minahasan nationalists. His success demonstrates how Indonesia's regional and religious minorities contributed essentially to building the nation.[^65]

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of Palar focus primarily on his diplomatic service during the later Sukarno period, particularly his defense of Indonesia's 1965 UN withdrawal and his support for the confrontation with Malaysia.

Contemporary Western diplomats and some later historians viewed Palar's unwavering loyalty to Sukarno's increasingly radical foreign policy as problematic. By lending his considerable diplomatic credibility to policies like Konfrontasi and UN withdrawal, critics argue, Palar enabled Sukarno's adventurism when Indonesia needed voices of moderation.[^66] The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation resulted in over 500 deaths, strained Indonesia's economy through military expenditures, and isolated Indonesia diplomatically—outcomes that contradicted Indonesia's long-term interests.[^67]

Some scholars question whether Palar's diplomatic skills were employed wisely during this period. His eloquence and international respect, earned through legitimate advocacy for independence, were deployed in defense of policies that damaged Indonesia's standing and harmed its development. As one diplomatic historian noted, Indonesia's 1965 UN withdrawal "reflected its diplomatic isolation but also removed a potential avenue for mediated settlement" of the Malaysia dispute.[^68]

Critics also point to Palar's apparent reluctance to counsel restraint or publicly distance himself from questionable policies. While diplomatic loyalty to one's government is expected, some argue that senior diplomats have responsibilities to provide candid advice and, when policies become destructive, to consider resignation rather than continued defense of the indefensible.[^69]

Malaysian and Western perspectives on the Konfrontasi period portray Palar as Indonesia's spokesman for "proxy warfare" that threatened regional stability.[^70] From this viewpoint, his diplomatic talents were misused in promoting confrontation rather than peaceful resolution.

Some Indonesian observers have also questioned whether Palar's relatively early retirement in 1968, at age 68, reflected disagreements with the Suharto regime's foreign policy direction. His absence from diplomatic service during Indonesia's reconstruction of international relationships and ASEAN's formation meant that his experience was not available during another crucial period.[^71]

These critical perspectives do not diminish Palar's achievements during the independence struggle but suggest a more complex legacy that includes both principled advocacy for justice and service to policies of questionable wisdom.
