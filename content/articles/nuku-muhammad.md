## Summary

Nuku Muhammad Amiruddin (c. 1738–1805), also known as Sultan Nuku or "Jou Barakati" (Lord of Fortune), was the nineteenth Sultan of Tidore who led one of the most successful indigenous resistance movements against European colonialism in Indonesian history. From 1780 until his death in 1805, he orchestrated a rebellion that united diverse ethnic groups across the Maluku Islands and Papua, temporarily liberating these territories from Dutch East India Company (VOC) control. Through strategic alliances with the British and various indigenous groups, he became one of the few Southeast Asian leaders to achieve major victories against European colonial powers, earning him recognition as a National Hero of Indonesia in 1995.

## Early Life and Background

Nuku was born around 1738 in Soasiu, on the island of Tidore in the Maluku Islands (Spice Islands) of present-day Indonesia.[^1] His childhood name was Kaicil Syaifuddin, and he was the second son of Sultan Jamaluddin, who ruled the Sultanate of Tidore from 1757 to 1779.[^2] Born into one of the four royal branches of the Tidorese dynasty, Nuku grew up in a complex political environment dominated by competing European colonial powers seeking control over the lucrative spice trade.[^3]

The Sultanate of Tidore, along with its rival Ternate, controlled vast territories across the Maluku Islands and western Papua, regions that were the world's only source of cloves, nutmeg, and mace.[^4] These spices commanded extraordinary prices in European markets, making the Maluku Islands a focal point of colonial competition between the Portuguese, Spanish, English, and Dutch. By the time of Nuku's birth, the Dutch VOC had established dominance over the region, imposing oppressive trade monopolies and reducing the once-powerful sultanates to vassal states.[^5]

Nuku had nine half-brothers and half-sisters through his father's various marriages, a typical arrangement for Malukan royalty of the period.[^6] Among his siblings were Kamaluddin, Zainal Abidin, Garomahongi, Muhammad Tahir (known as Mossel), Topa Mabunga, and Hassan—all of whom would play roles, sometimes antagonistic, in the political dramas that would unfold during Nuku's rebellion.[^7] Not much is documented about Nuku's childhood education or training, but as a prince of Tidore, he would have been schooled in statecraft, warfare, navigation, and the diplomatic intricacies necessary for managing the sultanate's far-flung territories.

The formative event of Nuku's early life occurred in 1768, when the Dutch VOC forced his father, Sultan Jamaluddin, to cede Tidore's rights to the island of Ceram (Seram), a large and strategically important territory.[^8] This humiliating concession planted the seeds of Nuku's lifelong hatred for the VOC. The resentment intensified dramatically in 1779 when Dutch authorities, suspecting Sultan Jamaluddin of conspiring with the British East India Company and the rulers of Bacan and Maguindanao, arrested and exiled the sultan along with two of Nuku's brothers to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) and later to Ceylon (Sri Lanka).[^9]

Following this coup, the VOC imposed a new treaty in 1780 that transformed Tidore from a nominal ally into a complete vassal state, stripping away the sultanate's autonomy.[^10] Rather than allowing Nuku to succeed his father according to traditional succession rights, the Dutch installed Patra Alam, Nuku's uncle, as a puppet sultan.[^11] This interference in Tidore's internal succession, combined with the exile of his father and brothers, convinced Nuku that accommodation with the VOC was impossible and that only armed resistance could restore his kingdom's sovereignty.

## Rise to Power

In July 1780, refusing to accept the Dutch-imposed order, Nuku made the fateful decision to leave Tidore Island and launch his rebellion.[^12] He sailed with a group of loyal followers to Patani in southeastern Halmahera, where he established his first base of operations and was proclaimed Sultan of Tidore with the title "Sri Paduka Maha Tuan Sultan Saidul Jehad el Ma'bus Amiruddin Syah Kaicil Paparangan" (Prince of Battles) by territories that recognized his authority.[^13] From Patani, Nuku sent messengers throughout Halmahera and to the kings of the Raja Ampat Islands in western Papua, calling for a united resistance against both the puppet Sultan Patra Alam and the VOC.[^14]

Nuku's appeal resonated powerfully across the region. He successfully gathered 20 kora-kora (traditional Malukan war canoes) with their crews from Patani itself, and his call was enthusiastically received by the King of Salawati, one of the four kingdoms of Raja Ampat, who sent 45 additional kora-kora to support him.[^15] Being a leader with extraordinary charisma, Nuku attracted followers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds: Tidorese, Ceramese, Papuans, Arunese, and many others who had suffered under VOC exploitation.[^16] His nickname "Jou Barakati"—meaning "Lord of Fortune" or "The Blessed Lord"—reflected how he was perceived by his followers: a man of prowess imbued with spiritual authority who would restore the shattered Malukan world to its pre-colonial glory.[^17]

Between 1780 and 1783, Nuku built a formidable kora-kora fleet in the waters around Seram Island and Papua, establishing defensive bases in East Seram in 1781.[^18] The kora-kora was a traditional Malukan war canoe that served as the backbone of indigenous naval power, capable of carrying men on long-distance raiding expeditions.[^19] Nuku found particularly strong allies in Halmahera, Seram, and the Raja Ampat Islands, regions with long traditions of maritime warfare and autonomy.[^20] He was proclaimed "King of the Papuans," and the communities of southeastern Halmahera and the Papuan Islands, which had maintained traditions of long-distance raiding, were co-opted into the fight against colonial rule.[^21]

In 1783, Nuku achieved his first major military victory. After overwhelming VOC forces, he forced the puppet Sultan Patra Alam to declare war on the Dutch and sailed to Tidore, where he was received enthusiastically by the local population.[^22] However, this triumph was short-lived. The VOC mobilized a substantial Dutch-Ternatan force that invaded Tidore and inflicted a devastating defeat on Nuku's forces, with more than a thousand Tidorese killed in the battle.[^23] Patra Alam was deposed and exiled to Java, and the Dutch installed another puppet ruler, Kamaluddin (Nuku's younger brother or kinsman), as sultan.[^24] Nuku was forced to flee, but rather than surrender, he withdrew to remote bases in the Raja Ampat Islands and Seram, from which he continued his rebellion.[^25]

During this period of retreat, Nuku demonstrated remarkable strategic patience and diplomatic skill. He used the island of Gebe, situated between Raja Ampat and Halmahera, as a staging base where he assembled a fleet of 300 perahus (boats) for plundering raids against VOC installations.[^26] For many Tidorese and other Malukans, Nuku became a champion for all of Maluku, as the local rulers were little more than Dutch puppets.[^27] The VOC undertook numerous naval expeditions to suppress Nuku's movement, but these met with varying and generally limited success in the difficult island terrain where Nuku's forces operated.[^28]

## Major Achievements

Nuku's greatest achievement was transforming what began as a dynastic succession dispute into a broad anti-colonial movement that united multiple ethnic groups and kingdoms across a vast archipelago. His ability to forge cross-cultural alliances was unprecedented in the region and represented a sophisticated understanding of coalition politics.[^29] The scholar Muridan S. Widjojo, in his definitive study "The Revolt of Prince Nuku: Cross-cultural Alliance-making in Maluku, c.1780-1810," analyzed how Nuku succeeded in regaining independence for the Sultanate of Tidore by creating alliances with the English and his Malukan and Papuan adherents, elaborating the complex dynamics of alliance-making and the diverse interests of Tidorese grandees, East Seramese traders, Papuans of Raja Ampat, and the fighters of Gamrange.[^30]

The strategic turning point came in 1795 when France occupied the Netherlands, triggering a reconfiguration of global colonial politics.[^31] Britain, now at war with France, dispatched squadrons to seize VOC possessions throughout Asia. Nuku brilliantly exploited these European conflicts by allying with the British against the French-affiliated Dutch.[^32] In 1796, with the assistance of two British ships, Nuku's forces captured Ambon and the Banda Islands, and by 1797, all VOC outposts in the Moluccas had fallen except Ternate, which remained in Dutch hands.[^33]

On April 12, 1797, in one of his most dramatic victories, Nuku's fleet of 79 ships, supported by one British vessel, surrounded Tidore Island and forced Sultan Kamaluddin to flee to Ternate.[^34] Nuku was unanimously elected as the new Sultan of Tidore, finally ascending to the throne that had been denied him for seventeen years.[^35] He ruled from 1797 to 1805, during which time he strove to restore Maluku to its pre-colonial division into four autonomous kingdoms, free from European monopolistic control.[^36]

The climax of Nuku's military achievements came in 1801 with the liberation of Ternate, the Dutch stronghold and Tidore's traditional rival. Initially, during the first siege of Ternate on January 22, 1801, British forces under Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Burr rejected Nuku's offer of assistance, despite a large fleet of prahu and kora-kora appearing under the command of Prince Mayor.[^37] However, in the second siege, William Farquhar, the Resident of Malacca who commanded the British expeditionary force, concluded that he had no choice but to accept the help of the Prince of Tidore.[^38] A British officer, Captain Lynch, was ordered to organize Tidore troops and teach them to fire 9-pound cannons.[^39] The combined British-Tidorese force successfully liberated Ternate from Dutch control in June 1801, marking one of the few decisive victories of indigenous forces over Dutch colonial rule and demonstrating Nuku's military effectiveness when properly equipped with European artillery.[^40]

Nuku's success in opposing the VOC's oppressive spice trade monopoly was another significant achievement. The Dutch had established brutal control over clove and nutmeg production, forcing Malukans to destroy spice trees outside designated plantations and implementing a centralized system that devastated local economies and autonomy.[^41] Under Nuku's leadership, territories broke free from these restrictions, at least temporarily, allowing local populations to benefit directly from spice cultivation and trade. His movement represented a restoration of economic sovereignty alongside political independence.

Perhaps most remarkably, Nuku was the only Indonesian leader up to the 20th century who was never defeated in battle by European colonizers—a distinction that contributed to his legendary status.[^42] By the early 19th century, thanks to his persistency and charisma, Nuku had become the leading political figure in Maluku and Papua.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Nuku is celebrated as a national hero in modern Indonesia, his methods and alliances have drawn some critical examination from historians. The most significant criticism concerns his alliance with the British, another colonial power. Although Nuku fought to liberate Maluku from Dutch control, he did so by allying with the British East India Company, effectively replacing one colonial influence with another rather than achieving complete independence.[^44] This pragmatic but potentially problematic approach raises questions about whether Nuku sought true sovereignty or merely a more favorable arrangement with a different European power.

The violent nature of Nuku's rebellion also presents moral complexities. The communities that supported Nuku, particularly those from southeastern Halmahera and the Papuan Islands, had long traditions of raiding over long distances, and these groups were co-opted by Nuku in the fight against colonial rule.[^45] These raids inevitably involved violence against civilians and the destruction of property. In October 1783, Nuku's forces attacked the Dutch post on Tidore, killing all the Europeans stationed there.[^46] In September 1783, a Dutch military expedition under Translator Coenraad Van Dijk was massacred by rebels on the island of Batanta, and all the artillery aboard the Dutch ship was distributed among Nuku's followers.[^47]

The warfare was brutal on all sides. The 1783 Dutch-Ternatan invasion of Tidore resulted in more than a thousand Tidorese killed, and the island was completely defeated.[^48] The Battle of Gorong saw hundreds of casualties, with vivid accounts of deaths from gunshot wounds and spears.[^49] While Nuku did not initiate the cycle of violence—the VOC's oppressive policies and exile of his family provoked the rebellion—his methods necessarily involved significant bloodshed and the disruption of civilian life across the region.

Another criticism concerns the long-term viability of Nuku's achievements. While he successfully liberated Maluku during his lifetime, his realm did not survive long after his death. When Britain withdrew from Maluku in May 1803 following the Peace of Amiens, which restored Dutch possessions to the French-dominated Batavian Republic, Nuku was left to fend for himself against an inevitable Dutch return.[^50] Nuku died on November 14, 1805, with his kingdom on the brink of renewed war with the Dutch.[^51] His successor, his brother Zainal Abidin, lacked Nuku's charisma and military prowess and was driven out of Tidore by a renewed Dutch attack on November 13, 1806.[^52] The realm Nuku constructed collapsed quickly, demonstrating the extent to which his movement depended on his personal leadership rather than on sustainable institutional structures.[^53]

Some scholars have noted that Nuku's rebellion was not driven by prominent Malukan ideological constructs supposedly shared among him and his adherents, suggesting his movement was more pragmatic than ideologically unified.[^54] This raises questions about whether Nuku truly represented a nationalist or anti-colonial ideology in the modern sense, or whether his revolt was primarily a dynastic power struggle that happened to align with broader indigenous grievances against the VOC.

The internal conflicts within Nuku's family also complicate his legacy. His half-brother Prince Hassan schemed to topple Nuku as Sultan and was murdered under obscure circumstances in 1800.[^55] His brother Kamaluddin served as a Dutch puppet sultan in opposition to Nuku, creating a civil war dynamic within the royal family.[^56] These family divisions suggest that Nuku's rebellion was as much about internal Tidorese politics as about anti-colonial resistance.

## Personal Life

Unlike most sultans of his era, who typically maintained harems with multiple wives and concubines, Nuku had only one wife, known as Geboca or Habiba Sinobe.[^57] Historical sources describe Geboca as a sensible and caring woman who served as an important advisor to her husband throughout his reign and rebellion.[^58] This monogamous relationship was unusual for a Muslim ruler of his status and era, and it speaks to either Nuku's personal preferences or possibly the practical constraints of his decades-long rebellion, which kept him constantly on the move between remote bases.

With Geboca, Nuku sired two sons and a daughter.[^59] Significantly, none of these children ever succeeded to the throne of Tidore, with succession instead passing to Nuku's brother Zainal Abidin upon his death in 1805.[^60] However, Nuku's bloodline continued, and one of his descendants, Haji Djafar Dano Junus, became titular Sultan of Tidore in 1999, centuries after the sultanate had lost its political power.[^61]

Nuku's personality emerges from historical accounts as charismatic, determined, and spiritually authoritative. His title "Jou Barakati" (Lord of Fortune or The Blessed Lord) was not merely honorific but reflected a genuine belief among his followers that he possessed a special spiritual power or blessing (barakah) that would enable him to succeed against the seemingly invincible VOC.[^62] This spiritual dimension of his leadership was crucial in Malukan culture, where political power was inseparable from supernatural legitimacy.

His other titles further illuminate his self-conception and public image: "Kaicil Paparangan" means "Prince of Battles," emphasizing his martial prowess.[^63] His full royal title, "Sri Paduka Maha Tuan Sultan Saidul Jehad el Ma'bus Amiruddin Syah," included the element "Saidul Jehad" (Master of Holy War), framing his rebellion in Islamic terms as a jihad against infidel colonizers.[^64] This religious framing helped mobilize Muslim populations across the archipelago.

Despite spending most of his adult life as a rebel commander operating from remote island bases, Nuku maintained the dignity and ceremonial authority expected of a sultan. When negotiating with the Dutch in Ternate in 1804, shortly before his death, Nuku arrived with a fleet of 47 kora-kora, demonstrating both military strength and royal pageantry.[^65] His ability to project power and maintain loyalty over 25 years of rebellion, often under desperate circumstances, speaks to exceptional leadership qualities.

## Legacy

Sultan Nuku died on November 14, 1805, at the age of 67, in Tidore, and was buried in Soa-Sio (also spelled Soasiu), the capital of Tidore.[^66] His tomb, called Makam Sultan Nuku, contains the graves of the royal family and has become a memorial site commemorating his resistance against colonialism.[^67] He died with his kingdom on the brink of renewed war with the returning Dutch, having achieved a remarkable but ultimately temporary liberation of his people.[^68]

Nuku's immediate legacy was fragile. His brother and successor, Zainal Abidin, inherited the anti-Dutch movement that Nuku had built but was not capable of resisting renewed Dutch attacks and was forced to flee from Tidore Island in 1806, just one year after Nuku's death.[^69] It was obvious that Zainal Abidin lacked the prestige and charisma of his brother Nuku.[^70] Zainal Abidin continued to resist from exile in Halmahera and Papua until his death in 1810, but with limited success.[^71] He was the last independent Sultan of Tidore, as his successors were firmly under British or Dutch control.[^72] Maluku remained steadily in European hands until the Japanese occupation in 1942.[^73]

Despite the collapse of his political achievements, Nuku's symbolic legacy grew over time. In modern Indonesia, he is commemorated as a pahlawan nasional (National Hero).[^74] On August 7, 1995, President Suharto formally awarded Nuku the title of National Hero of Indonesia through Presidential Decree No. 071/TK/1995.[^75] This recognition came nearly two centuries after his death, as Indonesia's post-independence government sought to construct a national narrative of resistance to colonialism that transcended ethnic and regional boundaries.

Nuku's legacy is particularly significant because he was among the very few Indonesian leaders up to the 20th century who achieved major victories in contests with European colonizers.[^76] Most anti-colonial rebellions in the Indonesian archipelago were quickly and brutally suppressed by superior European military technology and organization. Nuku's ability to sustain his rebellion for 25 years, to forge multi-ethnic alliances, and to temporarily liberate the Moluccas stands as an exceptional achievement in the history of resistance to European imperialism in Southeast Asia.

The scholarly recognition of Nuku's historical importance has also grown. Muridan S. Widjojo's 2009 book "The Revolt of Prince Nuku: Cross-cultural Alliance-making in Maluku, c.1780-1810," published by Brill as part of the TANAP monographs on the history of Asian-European interaction, brought Nuku's story to international academic attention.[^77] Scholars have congratulated Widjojo and others participating in the TANAP project for bringing to light obscure and difficult historical materials that form building blocks for a re-examination of Southeast Asian history.[^78]

Today, Nuku is remembered in Indonesia as a symbol of resistance, independence, and the refusal to accept subjugation. Streets, schools, and public institutions in North Maluku and across Indonesia bear his name. His story represents the possibility of indigenous agency and success against colonialism, even if temporary, and serves as a source of regional pride for the people of Tidore and the broader Maluku Islands. He bequeathed to memory the golden era of the Tidore Sultanate as a blessed and sovereign nation that, for a brief period, reclaimed its autonomy and dignity.[^79]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians sympathetic to anti-colonial movements regard Nuku as an exceptional figure in Indonesian and Southeast Asian history. His ability to unite disparate ethnic groups—Tidorese, Ceramese, Papuans, Arunese, and others—under a common cause of resistance represents a remarkable achievement in cross-cultural alliance-making that prefigured the multi-ethnic nationalism of 20th-century Indonesian independence movements.[^80]

Nuku's military achievements receive particular praise. He was the only Indonesian leader up to the 20th century who was never defeated in battle when fighting European colonizers—an extraordinary distinction that sets him apart from virtually all other indigenous resistance leaders in the archipelago.[^81] His strategic use of traditional kora-kora naval warfare combined with European artillery techniques demonstrated military innovation and adaptability.[^82]

Scholars emphasize Nuku's political sophistication in exploiting European rivalries. By allying with the British against the Dutch during a period of European geopolitical upheaval following the French Revolution, Nuku displayed an understanding of global power dynamics that enabled him to achieve military victories that would have been impossible through indigenous forces alone.[^83] This realpolitik approach, while sometimes criticized, demonstrated pragmatic strategic thinking.

Nuku's personal qualities—his charisma, persistence, and spiritual authority—receive consistent praise from historians. His nickname "Jou Barakati" (Lord of Fortune) reflects the genuine veneration he inspired among his followers, who saw him as possessing special blessing or spiritual power.[^84] Unlike many other rulers of his era, he maintained a monogamous marriage with his wife Geboca, who served as an important advisor, suggesting progressive personal values and genuine partnership.[^85]

Indonesian nationalist historians view Nuku as a proto-nationalist hero who fought for independence and sovereignty against foreign oppression. His formal recognition as a National Hero of Indonesia in 1995 reflects the Indonesian state's embrace of his legacy as part of a broader narrative of centuries-long resistance to colonialism.[^86] For the people of Tidore and North Maluku, Nuku represents regional pride and historical significance, demonstrating that their ancestors were not passive victims of colonialism but active agents of resistance.

The scholarly work of Muridan S. Widjojo has been particularly important in establishing Nuku's positive reputation in academic circles. Widjojo's detailed research, based on Dutch East India Company archives and local sources, presents Nuku as a skilled diplomat and alliance-builder whose rebellion had significant historical impact.[^87] Reviewers have praised this work for bringing obscure historical materials to light and enabling a re-examination of Southeast Asian history that centers indigenous agency.[^88]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars raise several concerns about Nuku's legacy and methods. The most significant criticism focuses on his alliance with the British East India Company. While Nuku fought against Dutch colonialism, he did so by collaborating with another colonial power, raising questions about whether he sought true independence or merely preferred British influence over Dutch control.[^89] This pragmatic alliance-making, while strategically effective, undermines narratives that present Nuku as an uncompromising anti-colonial nationalist.

The violence of Nuku's rebellion presents another area of criticism. The massacre of all Europeans at the Dutch post on Tidore in October 1783 and the killing of Dutch personnel on Batanta in September 1783 demonstrate the brutal nature of the conflict.[^90] While these acts occurred within the context of a justified anti-colonial struggle, they nonetheless involved killing civilians and prisoners. The raiding traditions of the Papuan and southeastern Halmahera communities that Nuku co-opted into his movement likely resulted in violence against non-combatants on all sides.[^91]

The short-lived nature of Nuku's achievements raises questions about their historical significance. His realm collapsed within one year of his death when his successor Zainal Abidin was driven out by renewed Dutch attacks in 1806.[^92] The fact that Maluku remained steadily under European control from 1806 until 1942 suggests that Nuku's rebellion, despite its temporary successes, did not fundamentally alter the trajectory of colonial domination in the region.[^93] Critical historians argue that Nuku's movement was too dependent on his personal charisma and leadership to create lasting institutional change.

Some scholars question whether Nuku's rebellion truly represented an ideological anti-colonial movement or was primarily a dynastic power struggle. The rebellion began as a response to the Dutch interference in Tidorese succession and the exile of Nuku's father, suggesting personal and familial grievances rather than principled opposition to colonialism per se.[^94] The internal conflicts within the royal family, including the opposition of Nuku's brother Kamaluddin and the murder of his half-brother Hassan, indicate that the rebellion was partly a civil war within Tidore's ruling elite.[^95]

Critics also note the lack of documented ideological framework for Nuku's rebellion. Unlike later anti-colonial movements that articulated explicit philosophies of nationalism, democracy, or social transformation, Nuku's movement appears to have lacked prominent Malukan ideological constructs, operating more on pragmatic grounds of restoring traditional power structures.[^96] This suggests that while Nuku resisted Dutch control, he may not have had a vision that transcended the restoration of pre-colonial sultanate authority.

The British withdrawal in 1803 and Nuku's inability to maintain independence without European support reveals the limitations of his strategy. When left to fend for himself after 1803, Nuku could not prevent the eventual return of Dutch power, suggesting that his successes were contingent on European rivalries rather than indigenous military superiority.[^97] This dependence on foreign powers undermines claims of genuine autonomy.

Finally, some postcolonial scholars question the lionization of traditional rulers like Nuku, arguing that sultanates themselves were hierarchical and often oppressive structures. While Nuku resisted Dutch colonialism, he sought to restore a feudal sultanate system that concentrated power in royal hands and perpetuated social inequality. From this perspective, Nuku represents resistance to foreign domination but not progressive social transformation.

## Famous Quotes

While specific documented quotes from Sultan Nuku are scarce in the historical record, several statements attributed to him or about his mission have been preserved through oral tradition and historical accounts:

> "Everything was done with only determination and purpose: to free the people from the clutches of colonizers and live peacefully in a free and independent realm." - Attributed to Nuku's stated mission[^98]

This statement encapsulates Nuku's declared objective of liberation and restoration of sovereignty, though its exact provenance is uncertain.

> "He had the aspiration to liberate all the islands of North Maluku (Maloko Ke Raha) from foreign colonizers." - Historical description of Nuku's goals[^99]

This describes Nuku's ambition to restore the traditional four-kingdom system of Maluku (Maloko Ke Raha), free from European control.

> "Jou Barakati" (Lord of Fortune / The Blessed Lord) - Nuku's honorific title[^100]

While not a quote, this title reflects how Nuku was perceived by his followers: as a divinely blessed leader who would restore the Malukan world. The title itself became a rallying cry during the rebellion.

> "Sri Paduka Maha Tuan Sultan Saidul Jehad el Ma'bus Amiruddin Syah Kaicil Paparangan" (His Majesty the Great Lord Sultan Master of Holy War el Ma'bus Amiruddin Shah Prince of Battles) - Nuku's full royal title[^101]

This elaborate title, which Nuku adopted upon being proclaimed sultan in 1780, frames his rebellion in religious terms as jihad and emphasizes his martial identity as "Prince of Battles," revealing his self-conception as both religious and military leader.

Unfortunately, the historical sources from Nuku's era are predominantly Dutch VOC records, which rarely recorded the actual words of indigenous leaders except in treaty negotiations. Oral traditions in Tidore may preserve more sayings of Nuku, but these have not been extensively documented in accessible scholarly literature.
