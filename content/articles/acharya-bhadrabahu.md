## Summary

Acharya Bhadrabahu was a Jain monk and scholar who was the last of the Shruta Kevalis (those who knew the entire Jain canon). He led a group of monks from north India to Karnataka during a great famine, which eventually led to the Digambara-Svetambara schism in Jainism. He is credited with bringing Jainism to southern India. His disciple was the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya, who is said to have embraced Jainism.
