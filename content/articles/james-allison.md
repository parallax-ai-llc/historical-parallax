## Summary

James Allison is an American immunologist who shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation. Allison studied CTLA-4 and showed that blocking this protein could activate the immune system to attack cancer cells. This led to ipilimumab, the first checkpoint inhibitor approved for cancer treatment.
