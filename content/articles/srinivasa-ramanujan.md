## Summary

Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions despite having almost no formal training in pure mathematics.[^1] Born into poverty in colonial India, he developed thousands of original theorems independently before collaborating with renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy at Cambridge University from 1914-1919.[^2] His work on partition functions, modular forms, and mock theta functions continues to influence modern mathematics, physics, computer science, and cryptography over a century after his death at age 32.[^3] He became the first Indian elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918, revolutionizing number theory through his extraordinary mathematical intuition.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, a small town in Tamil Nadu, southern India, into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family.[^5] His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur district, worked as an accounting clerk in a sari shop, earning a modest income, while his mother, Komalatammal, supplemented the family finances by singing at the local temple.[^6] Although his family were high caste Brahmins, they lived in extreme poverty, a condition that would shadow Ramanujan throughout much of his life.[^7]

Due to his father's demanding work schedule, young Ramanujan formed an exceptionally close relationship with his mother, from whom he acquired his deep religious beliefs and strict adherence to Hindu customs, particularly his lifelong commitment to vegetarianism.[^8] The family were orthodox Iyengars and ardent devotees of the goddess Namagiri, worshipped at the Temple of Namakkal, who would later play a profound role in Ramanujan's understanding of his own mathematical inspiration.[^9]

Ramanujan's mathematical brilliance manifested early in his childhood. Performing exceptionally well at primary school, he passed examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic at age 10 with the highest scores in his school district.[^10] After beginning secondary-level mathematics, the young prodigy began investigating and discovering independent mathematical results. By age 15, having been taught the method for solving cubic equations, he had created his own algorithm to solve quartic equations.[^11]

The pivotal moment in Ramanujan's mathematical awakening came at age 15 when he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr's "A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics," a book containing thousands of theorems presented with minimal or no proofs.[^12] Ramanujan systematically verified these theorems and developed his own ideas, teaching himself to think about mathematics in highly original, intuitive ways. This book became both his mathematical bible and, ironically, a limitation, as it did not emphasize the rigorous proof-based approach that characterized modern Western mathematics.[^13]

Upon graduation from secondary school in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded a scholarship to study at the Government College in Kumbakonam.[^14] However, his singular obsession with mathematical research led to his neglect of other subjects. He failed important examinations in most subjects beyond mathematics and consequently lost his scholarship.[^15] He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras (now Chennai) in 1907 but failed to obtain his FA degree for essentially the same reasons—his complete devotion to mathematics at the expense of all other academic pursuits.[^16]

Without a degree, Ramanujan left college and continued to pursue independent mathematical research, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.[^17] He grew up uneducated in formal mathematics and did much of his research while isolated in southern India, barely able to afford food.[^18] Despite these desperate circumstances, Ramanujan filled notebooks with thousands of mathematical results, formulas, and theorems that would later astonish the mathematical world.[^19]

## Rise to Prominence

After marrying in 1909, Ramanujan began searching for permanent employment to support himself and his young wife.[^20] His mathematical talents came to the attention of several influential figures in Madras. Ramachandra Rao, a collector and secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society, was deeply impressed by Ramanujan's work and supported his research financially for a time.[^21] However, Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity despite his poverty, obtained a clerical position with the Madras Port Trust in 1912, which provided him with modest financial stability while allowing him to continue his mathematical investigations.[^22]

The turning point in Ramanujan's life came in 1913 when he decided to write to several prominent British mathematicians, sending them samples of his work.[^23] Most did not respond or failed to recognize the significance of what they received. However, when his letter reached Godfrey Harold Hardy, one of the leading mathematicians at Cambridge University, everything changed.[^24]

Hardy later recalled that upon first seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions, he thought they "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before," and concluded that they must be true "because no one would have the imagination to invent them."[^25] After discussing the papers with his colleague John Edensor Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were "certainly the most remarkable I have received" and that Ramanujan was "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power."[^26]

Hardy immediately recognized that Ramanujan's work was extraordinary and began correspondence with him, emphasizing the importance of rigorous mathematical proofs. In his initial response, Hardy wrote: "I want particularly to see your proofs of your assertions here... everything depends on rigorous exactitude of proof."[^27] This would become a central tension in their relationship—Hardy's insistence on formal rigor versus Ramanujan's intuitive, proof-light approach.[^28]

Hardy arranged for Ramanujan to receive a special scholarship at the University of Madras and secured a grant from Trinity College, Cambridge.[^29] However, Ramanujan initially refused Hardy's invitation to come to England for purely religious reasons, as orthodox Brahmins were forbidden from crossing the ocean.[^30] He only relented after the goddess Namagiri blessed the invitation in one of his mother's dreams, which the deeply religious family interpreted as divine permission.[^31]

In 1914, Ramanujan traveled to England and began his legendary collaboration with Hardy at Cambridge University.[^32] This partnership would prove to be one of the most remarkable in the history of mathematics, combining Ramanujan's extraordinary intuition with Hardy's logical rigor to produce groundbreaking work in number theory and analysis.[^33]

## Major Achievements

During his five years at Cambridge from 1914 to 1919, Ramanujan produced an astounding body of mathematical work that continues to influence multiple fields over a century later.[^34] Together, Ramanujan and Hardy wrote approximately 100 joint papers and were instrumental in transforming England into a mathematical superpower, especially in number theory and analysis.[^35]

### Partition Function and Modular Forms

One of Ramanujan's most celebrated contributions was his work on the partition function p(n), which describes the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of positive integers.[^36] Just a year before his death, Ramanujan discovered remarkable patterns in partition numbers that had eluded other mathematicians.[^37] He noticed that, starting with 4, the number of partitions for every fifth integer is a multiple of 5; similarly, starting with 5, the number of partitions for every seventh integer is a multiple of 7, and starting with 6, the number of partitions for every 11th integer is a multiple of 11.[^38]

These discoveries, now known as Ramanujan's congruences, revealed deep connections between partition theory and modular forms.[^39] The Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula for the partition function has been widely applied in physics to find quantum partition functions and derive thermodynamic functions.[^40] Modern mathematicians like Ken Ono proved in 2000 that there are Ramanujan congruences modulo every integer coprime to 6, extending Ramanujan's insights far beyond what even he had imagined.[^41]

### Infinite Series and Pi Calculations

In 1914, Ramanujan found revolutionary formulas for infinite series for calculating pi, which form the basis of many algorithms used in computational mathematics today.[^42] His rapidly converging series for the value of pi have had a profound impact on mathematical analysis and enable the calculation of pi to millions of decimal places.[^43] These formulas demonstrate Ramanujan's uncanny ability to perceive deep mathematical truths through pure intuition.[^44]

### Mock Theta Functions

Perhaps Ramanujan's most enigmatic and profound work involved what he called "mock theta functions," discovered in the final year of his life.[^45] In his last letter to Hardy, written in January 1920 just months before his death, Ramanujan wrote: "I have discovered very interesting functions recently which I call 'mock theta functions'... they enter into mathematics as beautifully as the ordinary theta functions."[^46]

For decades, mathematicians struggled to understand the full significance of these mysterious functions.[^47] The material on mock theta functions, contained in what became known as Ramanujan's "lost notebook," is considered his deepest work.[^48] In 2012, researchers led by Ken Ono presented findings that confirmed Ramanujan's theories, demonstrating that mock modular forms could unlock insights into modern scientific phenomena, including the calculation of entropy in black holes.[^49]

### Other Mathematical Contributions

Ramanujan made substantial contributions across multiple areas of mathematics, including hypergeometric series, the Riemann series, elliptic integrals, the theory of divergent series, and the functional equations of the zeta function.[^50] His work on continued fractions, modular equations, and highly composite numbers broke new ground in number theory.[^51]

Between 1914 and 1919, Ramanujan published more than 30 research papers in prestigious journals including the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, and Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.[^52] His paper "Highly composite numbers" (1915) and "Modular equations and approximations to π" (1914) are considered classics of mathematical literature.[^53]

### Academic Honors

On May 2, 1918, at age 31, Ramanujan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, becoming only the second Indian to receive this honor after Ardaseer Cursetjee in 1841.[^54] He was elected "for his investigation in elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers" and was one of the youngest Fellows in the Royal Society's history.[^55] On October 13, 1918, he became the first Indian elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.[^56]

When Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, he unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan, calling his association with Ramanujan "the one romantic incident in my life."[^57] Hardy rated mathematicians on pure talent, giving himself a score of 25, Littlewood 30, David Hilbert 80, and Ramanujan 100.[^58]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his extraordinary mathematical gifts, Ramanujan's work faced significant criticism from the mathematical establishment, particularly regarding the lack of rigorous proofs accompanying his results.[^59] Most of the time, Ramanujan provided only results without detailed proofs, which became one of the central controversies throughout his career.[^60]

### Conflict Over Mathematical Rigor

The early 20th century witnessed intense debates over the foundations of mathematics, with leading figures emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous proofs.[^61] Hardy, an atheist and apostle of mathematical rigor, found himself in a delicate position trying to mentor Ramanujan without stifling his extraordinary intuition.[^62] Hardy pushed for proofs and traditional mathematical presentation, while Ramanujan resisted this approach.[^63]

When Hardy emphasized the need for rigorous proofs, Ramanujan responded defensively: "If I had given you my methods of proof I am sure you will follow the London Professor," suggesting he believed his unconventional methods would be dismissed.[^64] This fundamental conflict—Hardy's insistence on formal proof versus Ramanujan's reliance on intuition and divine inspiration—created ongoing tension in their collaboration.[^65]

### Errors in Analytic Number Theory

While Ramanujan's intuition proved remarkably accurate in many areas, Hardy acknowledged that in analytic number theory, "he was as imaginative as usual, but much of what he imagined was wrong."[^66] Hardy attributed this to the inherent difficulty of analytic number theory, where imagination had led many great mathematicians astray, and where rigorous proof is more important than imagination—the opposite of Ramanujan's natural style.[^67]

### Early Writing Flaws

Ramanujan's early mathematical writing suffered from significant presentation problems. Journal editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted: "Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him."[^68] This made it difficult for other mathematicians to verify and build upon his work.[^69]

### Defense of Ramanujan's Approach

Despite these criticisms, Hardy acknowledged that Ramanujan "knew when he had proved a theorem and when he had not," suggesting that Ramanujan understood the concept of mathematical proof even if he didn't always provide formal demonstrations.[^70] Hardy's mentorship focused on filling gaps in Ramanujan's education while preserving his unique mathematical vision—a delicate balance that neither found easy.[^71]

Modern mathematicians have verified that the vast majority of Ramanujan's intuitions were correct. Around 2,000 of his conjectures have been proven correct, demonstrating that his unconventional approach, while controversial, yielded profound mathematical truths.[^72] Nevertheless, the tension between intuitive insight and formal rigor remains a subject of discussion in mathematical philosophy, with Ramanujan's career serving as a central case study.[^73]

---

## Personal Life

On July 14, 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki Ammal (born March 21, 1899), a girl his mother had selected for him a year earlier.[^74] Janaki was only ten years old at the time of the wedding, a practice common in early 20th-century India.[^75] Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony, and the wedding was a traditional five-day event held alongside the wedding of Janaki's sister.[^76]

Following custom, Janaki continued to live at her maternal home for three years after marriage until she reached puberty, joining Ramanujan and his mother in Madras in 1912.[^77] Those who knew Ramanujan observed that he spent most of his time in mathematical research—not even a loving wife could distract him from what they called his "first love" of mathematics.[^78]

### Separation and Reunion

When Ramanujan left for Cambridge in 1914, he declined Janaki's request to accompany him, telling her she was probably too young to travel—a decision he would later deeply regret.[^79] During his five years in England, Ramanujan's mother shrewdly intercepted letters between the couple, creating additional separation and loneliness.[^80]

When Ramanujan returned to India in 1919, gravely ill, the year he and Janaki spent together had moments of tender affection.[^81] She cared for him devotedly, and he told his mother to retreat, expressing his regret that if only he had taken Janaki to England, he might not have felt so lost on foreign shores.[^82] Janaki nursed him until his death on April 26, 1920.[^83]

### Ramanujan's Personality and Religious Beliefs

Ramanujan was described as a person of somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners who lived simply at Cambridge.[^84] He was a deeply religious Hindu who credited his mathematical abilities to his family goddess, Namagiri Thayar (Goddess Mahalakshmi) of Namakkal.[^85]

Ramanujan openly stated that he received mathematical inspiration and sometimes complete formulas through dreams in which the goddess Namagiri appeared to him.[^86] He described seeing drops of blood in dreams, after which he would receive visions of scrolls containing complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes.[^87] For Ramanujan and his family, seeing blood drops in dreams was considered a sign of grace from Narasimha, the lion-faced avatar of Vishnu and consort of Namagiri.[^88]

Ramanujan famously remarked to Hardy: "An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God."[^89] This statement encapsulates his view of mathematics as a spiritual practice, a perspective that puzzled the atheistic Hardy but which modern scholars recognize as central to understanding Ramanujan's unique approach to mathematical discovery.[^90]

### Janaki's Later Life

After Ramanujan's death, Janaki returned to Madras and settled in Triplicane, supporting herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring.[^91] In 1950, she adopted a son, W. Narayanan.[^92] Described as philanthropic and sympathetic by nature, she financially supported the education of several children and young people in her community.[^93] Janaki died at her Triplicane residence in 1994 at age 94, having outlived her famous husband by 74 years.[^94]

## Legacy

Ramanujan's death at age 32 robbed mathematics of what might have been decades of additional groundbreaking discoveries, yet his brief career produced a legacy that continues to generate new mathematics over a century later.[^95]

### The Lost Notebook

In 1976, mathematician George Andrews made a remarkable discovery in a box stored at the Wren Library at Trinity College, Cambridge—over 100 pages of unpublished mathematical work by Ramanujan from the last year of his life.[^96] This "lost notebook," consisting of loose and unordered sheets containing over 600 mathematical formulas without proofs, caused tremendous excitement in the mathematical community.[^97]

The lost notebook contains Ramanujan's final work on mock theta functions, which mathematicians now recognize as his deepest contribution.[^98] George Andrews and Bruce C. Berndt have published multiple volumes (2005, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2018) providing proofs for the formulas in the lost notebook, demonstrating that Ramanujan's intuitions remained accurate even in his final, illness-plagued months.[^99]

### Modern Applications

Ramanujan's work has found unexpected applications across multiple fields of modern science and technology. His discoveries in mathematical computing have enabled the development of algorithms used in high-precision calculations and data security.[^100] Specifically:

**Computer Science and Cryptography**: Ramanujan's number theory contributions are vital in modern cryptography, underpinning digital security systems.[^101] His partition theory advances algorithm development crucial for optimizing computing processes.[^102]

**Physics**: The Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula has applications in quantum mechanics and statistical physics.[^103] Ramanujan's work on q-series, modular forms, and mock modular forms influences string theory and the calculation of black hole entropy.[^104]

**Quantum Computing**: The Ramanujan conjecture has led to explicit constructions of Ramanujan graphs and Ramanujan complexes, which have applications in creating Golden-Gate Sets in quantum computing.[^105]

**Artificial Intelligence**: The "Ramanujan Machine," named in his honor, uses artificial intelligence to discover new mathematical formulas, demonstrating how his legacy continues to inspire technological innovation.[^106]

### Cultural Recognition

India honors Ramanujan's memory by celebrating December 22, his birthday, as National Mathematics Day.[^107] This observance was formally instituted on December 26, 2011, by then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh during the 125th birth anniversary celebrations at Madras University.[^108] Schools and colleges throughout India organize special programs including mathematics quizzes, lectures, workshops, and exhibitions on this day.[^109]

In 2015, the biographical film "The Man Who Knew Infinity," starring Dev Patel as Ramanujan and Jeremy Irons as Hardy, brought Ramanujan's story to a global audience.[^110] Based on Robert Kanigel's 1991 biography of the same name, the film was shot at Trinity College, Cambridge, where Ramanujan had worked a century earlier.[^111]

### The Taxicab Number Legacy

One of the most famous anecdotes in mathematics involves Ramanujan's identification of the number 1729.[^112] When Hardy visited the ailing Ramanujan and mentioned arriving in taxi number 1729, describing it as "rather a dull number," Ramanujan immediately replied: "No, Hardy, it's a very interesting number! It's the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."[^113] Indeed, 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³.[^114] While this story might suggest Ramanujan recognized the property spontaneously, he had actually written it down before coming to England, demonstrating his intimate knowledge of number properties.[^115]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern mathematicians regard Ramanujan as one of the greatest mathematical geniuses in history, whose work opened entirely new areas of investigation.[^116] Hardy's assessment—rating Ramanujan at 100 on his informal scale of mathematical talent compared to 80 for David Hilbert, the preeminent mathematician of that era—has proven prescient.[^117]

Contemporary researchers emphasize that Ramanujan's notebooks contain hundreds of unproven claims and conjectures that mathematicians are still working to prove over 100 years later.[^118] The fact that approximately 2,000 of his conjectures have been verified as correct demonstrates the extraordinary accuracy of his mathematical intuition.[^119]

Ken Ono and other modern mathematicians describe Ramanujan's contributions as "timeless," noting that his work continues to yield new insights in fields Ramanujan could never have imagined, from quantum physics to computer science.[^120] The discovery that mock theta functions can be used to calculate black hole entropy exemplifies how Ramanujan's pure mathematical intuitions have found applications in cutting-edge theoretical physics.[^121]

Scholars emphasize that Ramanujan achieved his remarkable results despite, not because of, his lack of formal training.[^122] His isolation from mainstream mathematics forced him to rediscover many known results independently, but it also freed him to develop completely original approaches that conventionally trained mathematicians might never have attempted.[^123]

### Negative Views and Limitations

Some critics argue that Ramanujan's lack of formal training ultimately limited his potential impact.[^124] Hardy himself noted that in analytic number theory, Ramanujan's imagination led him astray, producing results that were simply wrong—a problem Hardy attributed to insufficient grounding in rigorous methods.[^125]

Mathematical historians point out that had Ramanujan received proper education earlier in his life, he might have avoided years spent rediscovering known results and could have focused his genius entirely on genuinely new mathematics.[^126] His early papers, while containing brilliant insights, also included elementary errors that better training would have prevented.[^127]

The controversy over mathematical rigor remains relevant. Some mathematicians argue that Ramanujan's approach—producing results without rigorous proofs—set a problematic example, potentially encouraging superficial pattern-recognition over deep understanding.[^128] The years mathematicians have spent proving Ramanujan's conjectures represent significant effort that might have been unnecessary had Ramanujan himself provided rigorous demonstrations.[^129]

Additionally, some scholars suggest that the romanticization of Ramanujan's story—the self-taught genius receiving divine inspiration—may create unrealistic expectations about mathematical discovery and undervalue the importance of systematic education and collaborative research.[^130]

Despite these criticisms, the overwhelming consensus among mathematicians is that Ramanujan's contributions represent a unique and irreplaceable enrichment of mathematical knowledge.[^131] As Hardy noted, even Ramanujan's errors often pointed toward interesting mathematical territory, and his verified results continue to inspire new generations of researchers.[^132]
