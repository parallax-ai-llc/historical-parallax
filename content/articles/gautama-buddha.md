## Summary

Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563/480 – c. 483/400 BC), known as the Buddha ("The Awakened One" or "The Enlightened One"), was a wandering ascetic and spiritual teacher who founded Buddhism in ancient India. Born as a prince in the Shakya kingdom (in present-day Nepal), Siddhartha renounced his privileged life at age 29 to seek the solution to human suffering. After six years of extreme asceticism and meditation, he attained enlightenment (Bodhi) under the Bodhi tree at age 35, discovering the Middle Way and the Four Noble Truths. For the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha traveled throughout northeastern India, teaching the Dharma (his discovery of the path to liberation from suffering) and establishing the Sangha (community of monks). His teachings became the foundation of Buddhism, now practiced by over 500 million people worldwide, profoundly influencing Asian civilization and gaining increasing adherents in the West.

## Early Life and Background

### Royal Birth

Siddhartha Gautama was born in Lumbini (in present-day Nepal) to King Śuddhodana, ruler of the Shakya clan, and Queen Māyā of the Koliya clan. Dates for his life are disputed, with scholars proposing either the "long chronology" (563-483 BC) or "short chronology" (480-400 BC). According to Buddhist tradition, Siddhartha's birth was attended by miraculous signs: Queen Māyā dreamed of a white elephant entering her womb, and the infant took seven steps immediately after birth, declaring "I am chief of the world."

Queen Māyā died seven days after childbirth, and Siddhartha was raised by his maternal aunt Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. The sage Asita visited the newborn prince and prophesied that he would become either a great universal emperor (chakravarti) or a great spiritual teacher who would remove the veil of ignorance from the world.

### Sheltered Palace Life

Concerned by Asita's prophecy, King Śuddhodana sought to prevent his son from encountering suffering that might inspire spiritual seeking. He confined Siddhartha to the palace, surrounding him with luxury, pleasure, and youth. The young prince was trained in warfare, statecraft, and the arts appropriate to his royal status. At age 16, Siddhartha married his cousin Yaśodharā, who bore him a son named Rāhula.

Buddhist texts describe Siddhartha living in three palaces (for different seasons) to shelter him from discomfort. He was provided with musicians, dancers, and every sensual pleasure. Yet this luxurious confinement left the prince dissat

isfied, sensing a deeper emptiness despite material abundance.

### The Four Sights

At age 29, Siddhartha ventured outside the palace walls on four chariot rides, encountering what became known as the "Four Sights" that transformed his understanding:

1. **An Old Man**: Siddhartha witnessed aging and learned that all youth eventually decays
2. **A Sick Person**: He saw disease and suffering afflicting human bodies
3. **A Corpse**: He confronted death, the inevitable end of all life
4. **An Ascetic**: He observed a wandering holy man seeking spiritual liberation, appearing peaceful despite having no possessions

These encounters shattered Siddhartha's sheltered worldview, revealing the universal reality of suffering (dukkha). The sight of the serene ascetic suggested a potential path beyond suffering.

## The Great Renunciation

### Leaving the Palace

Deeply troubled by discovering suffering's reality, Siddhartha made the momentous decision to abandon his princely life. One night, he looked upon his sleeping wife and infant son, feeling both love and recognition that attachment would prevent his quest. In an event called the "Great Renunciation," Sid

dhartha left the palace on his horse Kanthaka, accompanied only by his charioteer Channa.

At the forest's edge, Siddhartha cut off his hair with his sword, exchanged his royal garments for simple robes, and sent Channa and Kanthaka back to the palace. He became a śramaṇa—a wandering ascetic seeking truth. This renunciation of worldly life at its peak (youth, family, power, wealth) became a central model for Buddhist monasticism.

### Study with Teachers

Siddhartha first sought instruction from renowned meditation masters:

**Ālāra Kālāma** taught him to achieve the formless absorption called "the sphere of nothingness," a high meditative state. Siddhartha mastered this quickly, and Ālāra offered to make him co-teacher. But Siddhartha realized this state, though peaceful, did not end suffering permanently.

**Uddaka Rāmaputta** taught an even subtler absorption called "neither perception nor non-perception." Again, Siddhartha mastered the technique but recognized it did not provide ultimate liberation.

Concluding that meditative absorption alone could not end suffering, Siddhartha departed to pursue his own path.

### Extreme Asceticism

Siddhartha joined five ascetics practicing severe self-mortification near Bodh Gaya. For six years, he engaged in extreme austerities:
- Fasting until he consumed only a single grain of rice daily
- Holding his breath for extended periods
- Sitting motionless for days
- Exposing himself to extreme heat and cold
- Lying on thorns

These practices reduced him to skin and bones, bringing him near death. Buddhist texts describe his body becoming so emaciated that touching his stomach could feel his spine. Yet despite this extreme discipline, Siddhartha still had not achieved enlightenment.

## Enlightenment

### The Middle Way

Near death from self-starvation, Siddhartha realized that extreme asceticism was no more effective than extreme indulgence. He remembered experiencing a spontaneous meditative absorption (jhāna) as a child sitting under a rose-apple tree, achieved without self-torment. This memory revealed a crucial insight: the path to liberation lay neither in sensual indulgence nor in self-mortification, but in a "Middle Way" between extremes.

Siddhartha accepted milk-rice from a village girl named Sujata, breaking his fast and beginning to restore his health. Witnessing this, his five ascetic companions were disgusted, believing he had abandoned the quest, and they left him.

### Bodhi Tree

Strengthened, Siddhartha sat down beneath a pipal tree (later called the Bodhi Tree or "Tree of Awakening") in Bodh Gaya, vowing not to rise until he had found the truth. Buddhist tradition describes him sitting in meditation through the night, progressing through increasingly deep states of consciousness.

**Mara's Attack**: During his meditation, Māra (the personification of delusion, death, and desire) attempted to prevent Siddhartha's enlightenment:
- Sending his daughters to tempt him with seduction
- Sending armies of demons to terrify him
- Challenging his right to sit beneath the tree
- Siddhartha touched the earth, calling it to witness his countless past lives of virtue; the earth goddess appeared, testifying on his behalf

**The Night of Enlightenment**: As Māra was defeated, Siddhartha achieved successively deeper insights through three "watches" of the night:

1. **First Watch**: Recalled all his previous lives in detail, understanding the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra)
2. **Second Watch**: Developed divine eye (clairvoyance), seeing all beings dying and being reborn according to their karma
3. **Third Watch**: Directly realized the Four Noble Truths and comprehended dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda)—the chain of causation binding beings to suffering

At dawn, at age 35, Siddhartha became the Buddha—"The Awakened One"—having achieved complete enlightenment (nirvāṇa/nibbāna). He had broken the cycle of death and rebirth and discovered the path for others to do likewise.

## Teaching Ministry

### First Sermon

After enlightenment, the Buddha initially hesitated to teach, doubting whether others could understand his profound realization. According to tradition, the god Brahma Sahampati descended from heaven to request that the Buddha teach for the benefit of beings "with little dust in their eyes."

The Buddha traveled to Sarnath (near Varanasi), where he found his five former ascetic companions. To them, he delivered his first sermon, the **Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta** ("Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dharma"), expounding:

**The Four Noble Truths:**
1. **Dukkha**: Suffering/unsatisfactoriness exists
2. **Samudaya**: Suffering arises from craving/attachment (taṇhā)
3. **Nirodha**: Suffering can cease
4. **Magga**: The path to ending suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path

**The Noble Eightfold Path:**
1. Right View (understanding)
2. Right Intention
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Concentration

His five former companions, convinced by the Buddha's teaching, became his first disciples, forming the original Sangha (community of monks).

### Forty-Five Years of Teaching

For the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha walked throughout northeastern India (present-day Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), teaching anyone who would listen, regardless of caste, gender, or background—revolutionary in India's rigidly stratified society.

**Key Locations:**
- Bodh Gaya (enlighten

ment site)
- Sarnath (first sermon)
- Rajgir (many rains retreats)
- Savatthi (spent most rains retreats)
- Vesali
- Kosambi
- Kusinara (place of death)

**Teaching Style:**
The Buddha adapted his teaching (upāya-kauśalya—"skillful means") to his audience's capacity:
- Used parables and analogies
- Asked Socratic questions
- Refused to answer "unanswerable questions" that led to speculation rather than liberation
- Emphasized direct experience over blind faith
- Taught both lay followers and monastics

### Growing Sangha

The monastic community grew rapidly. The Buddha's early followers came from various backgrounds:

**Notable Disciples:**
- **Sāriputta** and **Moggallāna**: Chief disciples, leaders in wisdom and psychic powers
- **Ānanda**: Buddha's cousin and attendant for final 25 years, who memorized all teachings
- **Mahākassapa**: Became leader after Buddha's death
- **Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī**: Buddha's aunt/foster mother, first Buddhist nun
- **Yasodharā**: Buddha's former wife, later became nun
- **Rāhula**: Buddha's son, ordained as monk

**Women in the Sangha:**
The Buddha initially hesitated but eventually allowed women to ordain as nuns (bhikkhunī), a radical departure from contemporary Indian society. His aunt Mahāpajāpatī became the first nun, followed by Yasodharā and many others. However, the Buddha reportedly predicted that admitting women would shorten Buddhism's lifespan (from 1,000 to 500 years), and instituted additional rules for nuns.

**Royal Patrons:**
Kings and merchants supported the growing Sangha:
- **King Bimbisāra** of Magadha became an early supporter
- **King Pasenadi** of Kosala
- Merchant **Anāthapiṇḍika** donated Jetavana monastery
- **Visākhā** (wealthy female lay supporter)

## Core Teachings

### Dependent Origination

The Buddha taught *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent origination)—the principle that all phenomena arise in dependence upon conditions:

The traditional twelve-link chain describes how:
1. Ignorance leads to formations
2. Formations lead to consciousness
3. Consciousness leads to name-and-form
4. Name-and-form leads to six sense bases
5. Six sense bases lead to contact
6. Contact leads to feeling
7. Feeling leads to craving
8. Craving leads to clinging
9. Clinging leads to becoming
10. Becoming leads to birth
11. Birth leads to aging and death

Understanding this chain reveals how to break the cycle of rebirth.

### Three Marks of Existence

The Buddha taught three characteristics of all conditioned phenomena:
1. **Anicca (Impermanence)**: All things are constantly changing
2. **Dukkha (Suffering/Unsatisfactoriness)**: Clinging to impermanent things causes suffering
3. **Anattā (Non-self)**: There is no permanent, unchanging self or soul

The doctrine of an

attā directly contradicted the Hindu concept of ātman (eternal soul), becoming a distinctive Buddhist teaching.

### Karma and Rebirth

The Buddha accepted the Indian concepts of karma (intentional action) and saṃsāra (cycle of rebirth) but reinterpreted them:
- **Karma**: Intentional actions create consequences shaping future experiences
- **Rebirths** occur in six realms (gods, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings)
- Liberation (nirvāṇa) ends the rebirth cycle
- Ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom together lead to liberation

### Middle Way

The Buddha consistently advocated moderation between extremes:
- Between sensual indulgence and self-mortification
- Between eternalism (belief in permanent soul) and annihilationism (belief existence ends at death)
- Between absolute existence and non-existence

### Silence on Metaphysical Questions

The Buddha famously refused to answer certain "unanswerable questions" (*avyākṛta*):
- Is the universe eternal or not?
- Is the universe finite or infinite?
- Is the soul identical with the body or different?
- Does an enlightened being exist after death?

He compared asking such questions to a man shot with a poisoned arrow demanding to know who shot it, what wood the arrow was made from, etc., before allowing treatment. The urgent matter is removing the arrow (ending suffering), not metaphysical speculation.

## Final Days and Death

### Last Journey

At age 80, despite declining health, the Buddha continued traveling and teaching. During his final journey from Rajgir toward Kusinara, several significant events occurred:

**Illness at Vesali**: The Buddha fell seriously ill but recovered through meditation, telling Ānanda he had postponed death through willpower.

**Relinquishing Life**: At the Cāpāla shrine, the Buddha three times hinted to Ānanda that he could extend his life if requested. Ānanda, influenced by Māra, failed to ask. The Buddha then formally relinquished his will to live, declaring he would achieve *parinirvāṇa* (final nirvāṇa) in three months.

**Last Meal**: The Buddha accepted a meal from Cunda, a blacksmith. The food (possibly pork or mushrooms—texts unclear) caused severe dysentery, which would ultimately kill him. The Buddha insisted Cunda not be blamed and that only he could digest that particular food.

### Parinirvāṇa

Arriving in Kusinara, the Buddha lay down between two sal trees, his head pointing north. Surrounded by disciples, he gave final instructions:

**Last Words**: "All compounded things are subject to decay. Strive with diligence!"

**Final Questions**: He asked three times if any disciple had doubts or questions. All remained silent, moved by faith in his teaching.

**Passing Away**: The Buddha entered progressively deeper meditative absorptions, finally passing into *parinirvāṇa*—death with no rebirth. The moment of his death was marked by earthquakes and supernatural signs. According to tradition, even the trees wept, shedding flowers.

### Cremation

The  Mallas of Kusinara cremated the Buddha's body with great ceremony. Kings and communities from throughout northeastern India sent representatives to claim relics. The remains were divided into eight portions and enshrined in stupas (memorial monuments) across the region, becoming pilgrimage sites.

## Legacy and Impact

### Buddhist Councils

After the Buddha's death, his followers convened councils to preserve his teachings:

**First Council** (483 BC, Rajgir): Held three months after parinirvāṇa, 500 enlightened monks recited and codified the Buddha's teachings:
- Ānanda recited the Suttas (discourses)
- Upāli recited the Vinaya (monastic rules)

**Second Council** (383 BC, Vesali): Addressed disputes over monastic discipline

**Third Council** (250 BC, Pataliputra): Convened by Emperor Ashoka; finalized Pali Canon
