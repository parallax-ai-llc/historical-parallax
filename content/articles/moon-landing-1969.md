## Overview

On July 20, 1969, humanity achieved its greatest exploratory feat when Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to land on the Moon. Six hours after touching down in the lunar module *Eagle*, Armstrong took his historic "one small step." The mission fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth within the decade. It marked the pinnacle of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union and remains a defining moment of human achievement, watched live by 600 million people worldwide.

## Background

### The Space Race

**Sputnik (1957):**
Soviet Union launched first satellite. Shocked USA.

**Gagarin (1961):**
Yuri Gagarin became first human in space (Soviet).

**Kennedy's Challenge (1961):**
> "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth."

### The Apollo Program

**Cost:**
$25 billion (~$175 billion today). 400,000 workers involved.

**Tragedy:**
Apollo 1 fire (1967) killed astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee. Program almost canceled. Redesigned.

**Successes:**
Apollo 8 (1968) orbited Moon. Apollo 10 (1969) dress rehearsal.

---

## The Crew

**Neil Armstrong (Commander):**
Civilian (ex-Navy pilot). Cool under pressure. First to walk.

**Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin (Lunar Module Pilot):**
Air Force PhD. Second to walk.

**Michael Collins (Command Module Pilot):**
Stayed in orbit alone. Essential for return.

## The Mission

### Launch (July 16, 1969)

**Saturn V Rocket:**
Most powerful rocket ever built. Launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

### The Journey

Three days travel to Moon. Entered lunar orbit July 19.

### The Descent (July 20)

**Separation:**
*Eagle* (LM) separated from *Columbia* (CSM). Collins remained in *Columbia*.

**Alarms:**
Computer alarms (1201, 1202) flashed during descent. Guidance computer overloaded. Mission Control (Steve Bales/Jack Garman) gave "Go."

**Fuel Crisis:**
*Eagle* overshot landing site. Moved toward boulder field. Armstrong took manual control.

**Touchdown:**
Landed with ~25 seconds of fuel left.

**4:17 PM EDT:**
> "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."

---

## The Moonwalk

### One Small Step

**10:56 PM EDT:**
Armstrong descended ladder.

> **"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."**

(Transmission static obscured the "a," sparking decades of debate).

### Activities

**Surface Time:** 21 hours total (only 2.5 hours EVA outside).

**Tasks:**
- Planted US flag (stiffened with wire)
- Collected 47.5 lbs of rocks/soil
- Set up seismic experiment, laser reflector
- Took famous photos (almost all of Aldrin, taken by Armstrong)
- Call from President Nixon

### Aldrin's Description

> "Magnificent desolation."

---

## The Return

### Ascent

July 21. *Eagle* ascent stage acted as launch pad. Rejoined *Columbia*.

### Splashdown

July 24. Pacific Ocean. Crew recovered by USS *Hornet*.

### Quarantine

Astronauts spent 21 days in quarantine (fear of "moon germs").

---

## Technological Achievement

### Computing

Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) had 70KB memory—less than a toaster today. Software written by Margaret Hamilton's team.

### Engineering

Saturn V remains only rocket to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit.

---

## Cultural Impact

### Global Unity

Momentarily united world. "We did it" (not just Americans).

### Conspiracy Theories

**"Moon Hoax":**
Persistent belief that landing was faked on soundstage. debunked by:
- Moon rocks (unique isotopes)
- Retroreflectors still used
- LRO satellite photos of landing sites
- Soviet tracking

### Environmentalism

"Earthrise" photo (Apollo 8) and view of fragile Earth changed perspective.
