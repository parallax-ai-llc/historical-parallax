## Summary

Jeongjo (born October 28, 1752; died August 18, 1800) was the 22nd King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1776 to 1800.[^1] Often heralded as **"Jeongjo the Great,"** he is revered as a visionary reformer who led the **Joseon Renaissance**. The son of the tragic **Crown Prince Sado**, Jeongjo overcame immense political opposition and the trauma of his father's death to become a sage-king. He implemented the policy of **Tangpyeong** (Impartiality) to end factional strife, established the **Kyujanggak** (Royal Library) to cultivate talent, and constructed the magnificent **Hwaseong Fortress** in Suwon. His sudden death in 1800 is often seen as the end of Joseon's last golden age.[^2]

## The Son of Sado

Jeongjo's early life was defined by the greatest tragedy of the Joseon court. He was the son of **Crown Prince Sado**, who was executed by being locked in a rice chest by his own father, King Yeongjo, in 1762.
*   **"I am the son of Sado":** Upon ascending the throne in 1776, Jeongjo's first words to his ministers were the chilling declaration: *"I am the son of Crown Prince Sado."*[^3] This terrified the Noron faction, who had pushed for Sado's death, but Jeongjo chose reform over bloody revenge.

## The Reformer King

### Tangpyeong Politics (Policy of Impartiality)
Continuing his grandfather Yeongjo's work, Jeongjo actively appointed capable officials from all factions (Noron, Soron, Namin) and even illegitimate sons (Seoeol), breaking the Noron faction's monopoly on power.[^4]

### Kyujanggak (Royal Library)
In 1776, he established the **Kyujanggak** within the palace. Unlike a simple library, it became a research institute and political think-tank.
*   **Talent Recruitment:** Through Kyujanggak, he recruited brilliant "Silhak" (Practical Learning) scholars like **Jeong Yak-yong** and **Pak Che-ga**, fostering an intellectual revival that sought practical solutions to social problems.[^5]

### Royal Bodyguards (Jangyongyeong)
To protect himself from assassination threats and strengthen royal authority, Jeongjo established an elite royal guard unit called **Jangyongyeong**. This shifted military power from the faction-controlled establishment back to the king.[^6]

## Hwaseong Fortress and New City

Jeongjo's most ambitious project was the construction of **Hwaseong Fortress** in Suwon (1794–1796).
*   **Filial Piety:** Ostensibly built to guard the new tomb of his father (Prince Sado), it was actually a planned "New City" designed to be a self-sufficient political and commercial hub south of Seoul.[^7]
*   **Modern Engineering:** Designed by Jeong Yak-yong, the fortress utilized advanced engineering (like the 'Geojunggi' crane) and paid labor instead of forced corvée labor, reflecting Silhak ideals. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.[^8]

## Cultural Renaissance

Jeongjo was a prolific writer and scholar himself. His reign saw the flourishing of:
*   **Silhak (Practical Learning):** A movement moving away from empty Confucian metaphysics towards science, commerce, and agriculture.
*   **Genre Painting:** Artists like Kim Hong-do and Shin Yun-bok depicted the daily lives of common people with royal patronage.[^9]
*   **Commercial Growth:** He enacted the **Sinhae Tonggong** (1791), a policy that abolished the monopoly rights of the government-licensed merchants (Sijeon), allowing free trade and boosting the economy.[^10]

## Sudden Death and Mysteries

Jeongjo died suddenly on **August 18, 1800**, at the age of 47, from a severe abscess.
*   **Poisoning Theory:** Because his death came just as he was preparing for major political changes, rumors persisted that he was poisoned by the **Noron faction** and Queen Dowager **Jeongsun**. While most historians attribute his death to natural causes (excessive stress and untreated boils), the timing of his death remains one of Korea's great "what ifs."[^11]
*   **Aftermath:** His death marked the collapse of his reforms. The Jangyongyeong was disbanded, Silhak scholars were purged, and the 60-year era of Sedo Politics began.
