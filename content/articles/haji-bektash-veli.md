## Summary

Haji Bektash Veli was a mystic and philosopher from Khorasan who settled in Anatolia and became the founder of the Bektashi Sufi order. His teachings blended Sunni Islam, Shia elements, and pre-Islamic Turkish traditions. The Bektashi order became closely associated with the Ottoman Janissary corps. His emphasis on tolerance, equality, and love made his order one of the most heterodox and inclusive in the Islamic world.
