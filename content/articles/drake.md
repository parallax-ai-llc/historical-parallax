## Early Life and Background

Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario, to a multiracial and multicultural family.[^3] His father, Dennis Graham, is an African-American drummer from Memphis, Tennessee, who once performed with legendary musician Jerry Lee Lewis, while his mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian Ashkenazi Jew who worked as an English teacher and florist.[^4] Drake's extended family boasts impressive musical pedigree: his uncle, Larry Graham, was the famed bassist for Sly and the Family Stone and worked with Prince, while another uncle, Mabon "Teenie" Hodges, played guitar and co-wrote several hit songs with Al Green.[^5]

Drake's childhood was marked by significant challenges. His parents divorced when he was only five years old, after which he remained in Toronto with his mother while his father returned to Memphis, where he was subsequently incarcerated for several years on drug-related charges.[^6] This separation profoundly impacted young Drake, who would later channel these experiences into his emotionally vulnerable musical style. The family struggled financially, with Drake later stating, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was [from] Canadian TV."[^7]

Initially, Drake lived on Weston Road in Toronto's working-class west end until grade six, attending Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four and playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[^8] In 2000, he moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, experiencing a stark contrast in socioeconomic environments.[^9] In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school and celebrated his bar mitzvah at age 13.[^10] He has spoken openly about being bullied at school for his racial and religious background, navigating the complexities of his biracial, bicultural identity.[^11] Drake initially dropped out of high school to focus on his acting career but demonstrated his commitment to education by earning his high school diploma in 2012 at age 25.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Drake's path to stardom began in the entertainment industry through acting rather than music. At age 15 in 2001, he was cast as Jimmy Brooks on *Degrassi: The Next Generation*, the fourth series in the acclaimed Degrassi franchise.[^13] He portrayed a basketball star whose life changed dramatically after being shot by a classmate in the powerful 2004 episode "Time Stands Still," which left his character paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair.[^14] Drake appeared in approximately 100 episodes between 2001 and 2008, winning a Young Artist Award for his performance.[^15] 

The wheelchair storyline proved controversial for Drake's burgeoning music career. According to show writer James Hurst, Drake sent a letter stating "Aubrey Graham will not return to 'Degrassi' season six as Jimmy Brooks unless his injury is healed, and he's out of the wheelchair," expressing concern that "all my friends in the rap game say I'm soft because I'm in a wheelchair."[^16] Despite these reservations, the role provided crucial financial stability for his struggling family and taught him valuable lessons about performance and public image.[^17]

While still on *Degrassi*, Drake began pursuing music seriously. In 2006, before officially leaving the show, he independently released his debut mixtape *Room for Improvement*, which featured established artists such as Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco.[^18] He followed this with his second mixtape, *Comeback Season*, in 2007.[^19] The breakthrough came on February 13, 2009, when Drake released his third mixtape *So Far Gone*, which achieved massive success.[^20] The singles "Best I Ever Had" and "Successful" both entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart and achieved Platinum status, fundamentally changing the trajectory of his career.[^21]

The success of *So Far Gone* attracted the attention of industry heavyweights. By 2009, Drake had secured a record deal with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, marking his official entry into the mainstream music industry.[^22] This partnership proved transformative, as Lil Wayne's mentorship and the label's resources provided Drake with the platform to develop his unique artistic vision. His ability to seamlessly blend singing and rapping, combined with emotionally vulnerable lyrics that departed from hip-hop's traditional emphasis on toughness, began to reshape the genre's landscape.[^23]

## Major Achievements

Drake's musical achievements represent an unprecedented level of commercial success and cultural impact in contemporary music. His debut studio album, *Thank Me Later* (2010), debuted atop the Billboard 200, establishing a pattern that would continue throughout his career.[^24] Every subsequent studio album—including *Take Care* (2011), *Nothing Was the Same* (2013), *Views* (2016), *Scorpion* (2018), *Certified Lover Boy* (2021), *Honestly, Nevermind* (2022), and *For All the Dogs* (2023)—also reached number one in the United States.[^25] His fourth album, *Views*, led the Billboard 200 for 13 consecutive weeks, while his sixth album *Certified Lover Boy* set the then-record for most US top-ten songs from one album with nine entries.[^26]

Drake's chart dominance extends far beyond album sales. He holds numerous Billboard records that cement his status as one of the most successful recording artists in history. He has achieved 14 Billboard 200 number-one albums, a joint-record among male soloists, and 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, also a joint-record for a male solo artist.[^27] More impressively, Drake holds the records for most top 10 singles (81), most top 40 singles (217), most charted songs (359), and most consecutive weeks on the chart (431).[^28] He additionally has the most number-one singles on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot Rap Songs, and Rhythmic Airplay charts.[^29]

Drake's accolades include 5 Grammy Awards from 55 nominations, though notably, in 2022, he requested removal from the nominations list.[^30] All five of his Grammy wins have come in rap categories, including Best Rap Album for *Take Care* (2013), Best Rap/Sung Performance for "Hotline Bling" (2017), Best Rap Song for "God's Plan" (2019), and Best Melodic Rap Performance for "Wait for U" (2023).[^31] He has won a record 41 Billboard Music Awards from 102 nominations, including the prestigious Artist of the Decade award for the 2010s.[^32] In 2017, Drake set a single-night record by taking home 13 Billboard Music Awards.[^33]

Among the world's best-selling music artists, Drake has sold over 170 million units and is ranked as the highest-certified digital singles artist in the United States.[^34] His "It's All A Blur Tour" grossed $320.5 million, becoming the highest-grossing hip-hop tour in history.[^35] On February 3, 2025, Drake announced *Some Sexy Songs 4 U*, a collaborative album with PartyNextDoor, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, tying the record with Jay-Z and Taylor Swift for most number-one albums by a solo artist.[^36] On February 16, 2025, Drake became the first artist in history to headline all three days at the 2025 Wireless Festival, selling out all tickets in minutes.[^37]

Beyond music performance, Drake has built a formidable business empire. He founded October's Very Own (OVO), which began as a MySpace page and blog before evolving into a comprehensive lifestyle brand.[^38] OVO generates an estimated $75 million annually, with OVO Clothing alone bringing in more than $50 million in sales each year through collaborations with the NFL, MLS, and its own releases.[^39] Drake, along with producers Noah "40" Shebib and Oliver El-Khatib, launched OVO Sound record label in 2012, which in 2024 secured a joint venture with Sony's Santa Anna, amplifying international distribution and influence.[^40] Drake's most valuable asset is his 2022 deal with Universal Music Group worth $400 million, covering publishing, merchandise, media projects, and his music catalog.[^41]

Drake's entrepreneurial ventures extend into multiple industries. His production company, DreamCrew, has produced television hits like *Top Boy* (Netflix) and *Euphoria* (HBO).[^42] He holds tech investments in startups such as Robinhood and Omni.[^43] In sports, Drake partnered with LeBron James on a $1.2 billion A.C. Milan acquisition fund, making him a minority shareholder in the major European football club.[^44] His cannabis ventures include More Life Growth Co. and Bullrider premium products.[^45] With 52 incorporated entities, including 38 LLCs, Drake's business empire has generated over $200 million combined, contributing significantly to his estimated net worth of $250-400 million as of 2025.[^46][^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Drake's career has been marked by several significant controversies that have challenged his reputation and authenticity within hip-hop culture. The most explosive conflict emerged in 2024-2025 with his feud against Kendrick Lamar, which has been described as "the biggest beef in recent rap history" and went "miles beyond the usual lyrical martial artistry."[^48] The conflict escalated to serious personal accusations on both sides, with Kendrick alleging that Drake has issues with alcohol and gambling, controversially calling him a "certified pedophile" in the diss track "Not Like Us," joking that he was "tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor."[^49] Lamar also alleged that Drake is hiding another child besides his son Adonis and criticized him for allegedly co-opting elements of Atlanta's hip-hop culture despite having no roots in the city, labeling him a "colonizer."[^50]

Drake responded with his own allegations in "Family Matters," claiming that one of Lamar's children is biologically from Dave Free, Lamar's friend and label co-founder, and alleging infidelity in Lamar's relationship with fiancée Whitney Alford.[^51] Both artists received significant criticism for using women and family members as "punchlines" in their respective diss tracks.[^52] Critics noted hypocrisy in both parties' messaging, particularly that Drake, who accused Lamar of allegedly abusing women, had publicly supported Chris Brown and Tory Lanez, both arrested for domestic violence.[^53] The feud extended into legal territory when Drake filed a New York lawsuit alleging that Universal Music Group pumped up the popularity of "Not Like Us" on streaming services, though the lawsuit was dismissed on October 9, 2025.[^54][^55]

Another major controversy involved ghostwriting allegations. In summer 2015, rapper Meek Mill alleged that Quentin Miller ghostwrote numerous tracks on Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, claiming Miller wrote Drake's verse on their collaboration "R.I.C.O."[^56] Hot 97's Funk Flex subsequently played Miller's reference track for Drake's "10 Bands" on the radio, lending credence to the accusations.[^57] While Miller stated "I am not and never will be a 'ghostwriter' for Drake.. Im proud to say that we've collaborated," he was credited as a songwriter on four tracks from the project.[^58] Notably, despite laying a reference track for "R.I.C.O.," Miller received no co-writing credit on that song, suggesting the "ghostwriter" description may be accurate.[^59] Miller later claimed he was never properly paid for his work on *If You're Reading This It's Too Late* and that the controversy turned his life into "hell," allegedly resulting in a physical assault by Meek's team at a Nike store in Los Angeles.[^60][^61]

Drake's personal life has also generated controversy. His relationship with Sophie Brussaux, a French artist and former model, became public in 2017 when she claimed to be pregnant with his child.[^62] Drake initially remained silent about the situation, but by March 2018, a DNA test confirmed he was the father of their son Adonis, born October 11, 2017.[^63] He finally admitted paternity in June 2018 on his album *Scorpion*.[^64] This controversy was weaponized by Pusha T in the diss track "The Story of Adidon," which revealed Drake's hidden child before Drake could announce it himself, creating significant public relations challenges.[^65]

Drake's long-standing feud with Chris Brown, which escalated in June 2012 when their respective entourages threw bottles at each other in a New York City nightclub allegedly over Rihanna, damaged his image.[^66] Drake later stated that Brown's insecurities stemmed from "the fact that I make better music than him" and "that at one point in life, the woman that he loves fell into my lap."[^67] Though the two eventually reconciled in 2018 and collaborated on "No Guidance" in 2019, Drake faced criticism for working with Brown given his history of domestic violence against Rihanna.[^68][^69]

Academic and cultural critics have also questioned Drake's authenticity. Scholarly analyses examine "performances of intra-racial appropriation" and "discursive constructions of race, hip hop and Canada," with researchers noting that "Canada's role in the global hip hop movement has always been contested."[^70][^71] Some critics argue that Drake has "hijacked hip hop" as a pop star rather than a genuine hip-hop artist, questioning his relationship to the culture and his claims to authenticity.[^72]

## Personal Life

Drake's personal life reflects the complexities of navigating fame, family, and relationships in the public eye. He is the father of one publicly known child, Adonis Graham, born October 11, 2017, to French artist and former model Sophie Brussaux.[^73] The pair met during Drake's Boy Meets World tour in Amsterdam in late January 2017, shortly after his highly publicized split from Jennifer Lopez.[^74] Despite the rocky beginning to their relationship, which included paternity proceedings and initial secrecy about Adonis's existence, Drake and Brussaux have developed what is described as a healthy co-parenting relationship.[^75] In June 2022, Brussaux made a rare public post about Drake, wishing him a happy Father's Day and expressing gratitude for having him as her son's father.[^76] The former couple recently reunited in October 2025 to jointly celebrate Adonis's eighth birthday with a grand western-themed party.[^77]

Drake has been romantically linked to numerous high-profile women throughout his career, most notably Rihanna. Their relationship, which allegedly began around 2009 shortly after Rihanna's public split from Chris Brown, remained ambiguous for years.[^78] Though neither openly confirmed a relationship, they were frequently spotted together and collaborated on multiple hit songs, maintaining a close connection that Drake referenced in numerous tracks.[^79] The on-again, off-again nature of their relationship became a source of tension with Chris Brown and inspired much of Drake's emotionally vulnerable music about love and heartbreak.[^80]

Personality-wise, Drake is known for bringing an emotional and vulnerable style to hip-hop that departed from the genre's traditional emphasis on toughness.[^81] This authenticity in expressing feelings about relationships, achievement, and personal struggles has become his signature style, though it has also drawn criticism from those who question his credibility within hip-hop culture.[^82] Drake's biracial and bicultural identity—being both Black and Jewish, American and Canadian—has profoundly shaped his worldview and artistic expression, though it has also been a source of both pride and controversy throughout his career.[^83]

Drake maintains deep ties to his hometown of Toronto, where he resides when not touring. On September 30, 2013, the 26-year-old was announced as the "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, joining the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team and playing a leading role in the franchise's rebranding efforts.[^84][^85] His involvement spans team aesthetics, merchandise campaigns, fan engagement, and locker room morale, with the most visually striking aspect being the introduction of the Raptors' black and gold color scheme inspired by his OVO brand.[^86] Drake was instrumental in helping secure the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto and became immortalized in the team's history during their 2019 NBA Championship, riding on the championship float with team members as over 1.5 million people attended the parade.[^87][^88]

## Legacy

Drake's legacy as one of the most influential figures in 21st-century music and popular culture is multifaceted and profound. He is widely credited with revolutionizing hip-hop by popularizing the fusion of singing and rapping in 2010, a style that countless artists have since adopted.[^89] Drake brought an emotional and vulnerable approach to rapping that departed from the genre's traditional emphasis on toughness, paving the way for the emo-rap subgenre and artists such as Lil Uzi Vert, Juice WRLD, and Post Malone.[^90][^91] His album *Thank Me Later* contributed significantly to the development and popularization of emo-rap due to its successful blend of traditional rap and emotionally vulnerable lyrics.[^92]

Drake's cultural influence extends far beyond musical innovation. He is recognized as a key cultural figure who has popularized slang (most notably "YOLO" from his 2011 single "The Motto"), influenced fashion trends, and established the tone for conversations about relationships and achievement.[^93][^94] He possesses a unique ability to spot emerging trends well before they surface and often plays a direct role in bringing those trends to mainstream attention.[^95] According to multiple analyses, Drake has achieved "a level of cultural influence that surpasses even his predecessors, Kanye West and Lil Wayne."[^96] Remarkably, even in years where his artistic output has been minimal, his influence has continued to resonate throughout music in intriguing ways.[^97]

Drake is credited with popularizing the "Toronto sound" and leading the "Canadian Invasion" of American music charts alongside Justin Bieber and The Weeknd, fundamentally changing perceptions of Canadian artists in the global music industry.[^98] His incorporation of R&B, dancehall, house, and other genres into his music has expanded the definition of what hip-hop can sound like, inspiring a wave of artists to experiment with his blueprint.[^99] He has solidified his influence on a global scale by crafting music that transcends borders and cultural boundaries.[^100]

Commercially, Drake's legacy is unparalleled. He is the only musician with more than 300 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, with a total of 358 entries as of recent counts.[^101] He has amassed over 30 billion streams on Spotify alone and has maintained a presence on the Billboard charts every week since achieving chart prominence.[^102] Billboard named him the Artist of the Decade for the 2010s and ranked him as the fourth greatest pop star of the 21st century.[^103]

However, perspectives on Drake's legacy vary significantly. While mainstream sources celebrate his innovation and commercial success, some critics and scholars offer more nuanced or critical assessments. Academic analyses examine his "performances of intra-racial appropriation," his "hybrid identities," and the "impossibility of being Drake" within the context of authentic hip-hop culture.[^104][^105] Some critics argue he has "hijacked hip hop" as a pop star, questioning whether his relationship to the culture is genuine or appropriative.[^106] These debates about authenticity, cultural ownership, and artistic integrity will likely continue to shape discussions of Drake's legacy for years to come.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholars who view Drake favorably emphasize his revolutionary impact on contemporary music and culture. Musical analysts highlight how Drake democratized vulnerability in hip-hop, creating space for emotional expression that previous generations of rappers would have considered weakness.[^107] His album *Take Care* is frequently cited by critics as a masterpiece that redefined the genre's boundaries and established a new template for introspective, melody-driven rap music.[^108] Proponents argue that Drake's ability to blend genres—seamlessly incorporating R&B, dancehall, Afrobeats, UK grime, and house music into his hip-hop foundation—demonstrates artistic sophistication rather than cultural appropriation.[^109]

Business scholars and cultural commentators praise Drake's entrepreneurial acumen, noting that he has successfully built a multifaceted empire that extends far beyond music.[^110] His OVO brand, record label, and diverse business ventures demonstrate how modern artists can leverage their cultural influence into sustainable business models.[^111] Supporters argue that his partnership with the Toronto Raptors elevated both the team's global profile and the city of Toronto's cultural significance, culminating in the historic 2019 NBA Championship where Drake's presence added "a layer of intensity and cultural magnitude."[^112]

Defenders of Drake's authenticity point to his genuine Toronto roots, his early struggles with poverty and his mother's illness, and his lived experience navigating biracial and bicultural identity as evidence of his legitimacy.[^113] They argue that his commercial success does not diminish his artistic contributions and that criticisms of his popularity often stem from elitism within hip-hop culture. Billboard's recognition of Drake as Artist of the Decade and as one of the greatest pop stars of the 21st century reflects mainstream critical consensus that his influence has been overwhelmingly positive.[^114]

### Negative Views

Critics of Drake raise substantial concerns about authenticity, artistic integrity, and cultural appropriation. Scholarly analyses, particularly those examining "discursive constructions of race, hip hop and Canada," argue that Drake's relationship to Black American hip-hop culture is fundamentally problematic.[^115] An academic article titled "The impossibility of being Drake" explores how his Canadian nationality, mixed-race identity, and middle-class suburban upbringing complicate his claims to hip-hop authenticity, which traditionally values street credibility and specific forms of Black American cultural experience.[^116]

The ghostwriting controversy with Quentin Miller significantly damaged Drake's credibility within hip-hop, where writing one's own lyrics is considered fundamental to artistic legitimacy.[^117] Critics argue that if Drake relied on reference tracks and uncredited writers, his reputation as a lyricist and his Grammy awards for songwriting become questionable.[^118] Meek Mill's accusations and the subsequent evidence presented by Funk Flex created lasting doubts about the authenticity of Drake's creative process.[^119]

Cultural critics have condemned Drake's pattern of allegedly appropriating regional sounds and styles—from Atlanta trap to UK grime to Caribbean dancehall to Afrobeats—without proper acknowledgment or compensation to the originators.[^120] Kendrick Lamar's accusation of Drake being a "colonizer" reflects broader concerns within hip-hop about Drake's relationship to various Black musical traditions.[^121] Some argue that Drake exploits these cultural resources for commercial gain while contributing little back to the communities that created them.

Drake's personal controversies, particularly the hidden child scandal and his relationships with significantly younger women, have also drawn substantial criticism.[^122] His reconciliation and collaboration with Chris Brown despite Brown's history of domestic violence against Rihanna—a woman Drake claimed to care deeply about—struck many as hypocritical and morally problematic.[^123] The serious allegations in the Kendrick Lamar feud, regardless of their veracity, damaged Drake's public image and raised troubling questions about his character.[^124]

Finally, some hip-hop purists argue that Drake represents the commercialization and dilution of hip-hop culture, prioritizing mainstream pop appeal and streaming numbers over artistic innovation and cultural authenticity.[^125] They contend that while Drake may be commercially successful, his legacy will be that of a pop star who capitalized on hip-hop's popularity rather than a genuine artist who advanced the culture.[^126]
