## Summary

Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882) was an Italian general, revolutionary, and republican who became one of the most celebrated military commanders of the 19th century and a central figure in the unification of Italy. Known as the "Hero of the Two Worlds" for his military campaigns in both South America and Europe, Garibaldi led his volunteer army of Redshirts in the legendary Expedition of the Thousand, conquering Sicily and Naples in 1860 and delivering southern Italy to King Victor Emmanuel II. His mastery of guerrilla warfare, charismatic leadership, and unwavering dedication to Italian independence made him an international symbol of freedom and nationalism, though his journey from republican idealist to pragmatic monarchist ally revealed the complex political realities of the Risorgimento.

## Early Life and Background

Giuseppe Maria Garibaldi was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which had been conquered by the French Republic in 1792 and was part of the French Empire at his birth.[^1] He came from a Ligurian family—his father Domenico Garibaldi was from Chiavari and worked as a fisherman and coastal trader, while his mother Maria Rosa Nicoletta Raimondo came from Loano.[^2] The family engaged in modest trade and fishing, and for more than ten years, Giuseppe himself followed in his father's footsteps as a sailor.[^3] His mother was a pious woman who had hoped her son would join the priesthood, but Giuseppe showed little inclination for religious life from an early age.[^4]

Garibaldi's education was unsystematic and largely self-directed. A priest taught him to read and write Italian, filling him with enthusiasm for Italian history and the country's past glories.[^5] Another important influence was Signor Arena, a veteran of Napoleon's military campaigns, who taught him Italian through readings of ancient history.[^6] Although there was no formal system in the child's education, young Giuseppe was constantly learning something new on his own initiative. Speaking both Italian and French since childhood due to Nice's location, he also acquired knowledge of Spanish, Greek, Latin, and English throughout his life.[^7] Giuseppe molded his unsystematic education according to his own needs and personal inclinations, showing an early independence of mind that would characterize his entire career.[^8]

His disinclination toward disciplined intellectual activity led him to leave school at an early age and embark upon a career as a seaman at fifteen, working on cargo ships in trade with the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea.[^9] By 1832, he had earned certification as a merchant captain, demonstrating his competence in maritime affairs.[^10] The sea provided not only a livelihood but also an education in navigation, leadership, and the wider world beyond the confines of Nice. These formative years at sea exposed him to different peoples, cultures, and ideas, preparing him for the revolutionary life that lay ahead. The young sailor could not have imagined that his maritime skills would soon be employed not merely in commerce but in revolutionary warfare across two continents.

## Rise to Power

Garibaldi's transformation from merchant captain to revolutionary began in 1833 when he met Giovanni Battista Cuneo, a member of Giuseppe Mazzini's secret Young Italy movement, in April of that year.[^11] In November 1833, Garibaldi met Mazzini himself in Genoa, beginning a relationship that would profoundly shape Italian history, though it would ultimately be marked by both collaboration and bitter disagreement.[^12] Mazzini's vision of a unified Italian republic captured Garibaldi's imagination and gave purpose to his restless energy. The young sailor embraced the republican nationalism of the Young Italy movement and became a supporter of Italian unification under a democratic republican government.[^13]

In February 1834, Garibaldi participated in a Mazzinian-inspired mutiny intended to provoke a republican revolution in Piedmont, but the plot failed catastrophically.[^14] Garibaldi managed to escape to Marseilles, but a Genoese court condemned him to death in absentia.[^15] This failure forced Garibaldi into exile and began his South American odyssey, which would last from 1836 to 1848 and forge him into the military leader who would later unite Italy.[^16] These were not years of mere hiding but of active revolutionary engagement in the struggles of South America.

In 1835, Garibaldi joined the Ragamuffin rebels in Brazil's Ragamuffin War, taking up their cause of establishing the Riograndense Republic and later the Catarinense Republic.[^17] He volunteered as a naval captain for the Rio Grande do Sul republic during that small state's unsuccessful attempt to break free from the Brazilian Empire, where he preyed on Brazilian shipping with considerable success.[^18] In 1839, commanding a fleet of six ships, Garibaldi captured the Brazilian city of Laguna, and the rebels proclaimed the Catarinense Republic in the Brazilian province of Santa Catarina.[^19] It was during this campaign that he met Ana Maria de Jesus Ribeiro da Silva, known as Anita, who would become his companion in arms and first wife. Anita possessed what one of Garibaldi's comrades described as "an amalgam of two elemental forces…the strength and courage of a man and the charm and tenderness of a woman."[^20]

In 1841, Garibaldi and Anita moved to Montevideo, Uruguay, where he initially worked as a trader and schoolmaster to support himself.[^21] When the Uruguayan Civil War erupted, Garibaldi raised an Italian force known as the Redshirts—the first unit to bear this name that would become so closely associated with him.[^22] In the service of Uruguay, he took command of the newly formed Italian Legion at Montevideo and defended the city against the forces of Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas.[^23] His victory at the Battle of Sant'Antonio in February 1846 was small in scale but heroic in execution, and news of this triumph reached Europe, establishing Garibaldi's reputation as a brilliant military commander.[^24] His South American experiences provided invaluable training in the techniques of guerrilla warfare that he would later employ with devastating effect against the conventional armies of France and Austria.[^25]

In August 1847, after more than twelve years in South America during which he learned the art of guerrilla warfare and survived torture and countless near-death experiences, Garibaldi returned to Europe to resume the fight for Italian unification.[^26] The revolutions sweeping across Europe in 1848 seemed to offer the opportunity he had been waiting for, and Italy's national hero was finally coming home.

## Major Achievements

Garibaldi's most significant contribution to history was his military and symbolic role in the unification of Italy, the Risorgimento, which transformed the Italian peninsula from a collection of separate states into a unified nation.[^27] One of the great masters of guerrilla warfare, Garibaldi was responsible for most of the military victories of the Risorgimento, and almost equally important was his contribution as a propagandist to the unification cause.[^28] He is considered one of Italy's "fathers of the fatherland," along with Camillo Benso di Cavour, King Victor Emmanuel II, and Giuseppe Mazzini.[^29]

When Garibaldi returned to Italy in 1848, he immediately commanded military campaigns for Italian unification.[^30] In 1849, he was promoted to General of the short-lived Roman Republic, and at Mazzini's urging, took command of the defense of Rome against French forces sent to restore Pope Pius IX.[^31] On April 30, 1849, the Republican army under Garibaldi's command defeated a numerically far superior French army at the Porta San Pancrazio gate of Rome—a stunning victory that demonstrated his military genius.[^32] Despite heroic resistance and determined stands on the walls of Rome, the French ultimately prevailed on June 29 with overwhelming numbers and artillery, but Garibaldi's defense of Rome made him a hero of Italian nationalists.[^33] He withdrew from the city with several thousand volunteers, embarking on an epic march during which his beloved Anita died while carrying their fifth child.[^34]

In 1854, Garibaldi returned to Italy and bought half of the island of Caprera, which would become his home and sanctuary.[^35] During the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, he was appointed major general and formed a volunteer unit named the Hunters of the Alps, winning several engagements against Austrian forces.[^36] However, his most spectacular achievement came in 1860 with the legendary Expedition of the Thousand (Spedizione dei Mille). In May 1860, Garibaldi collected 1,089 volunteers and sailed from Quarto near Genoa aboard two ships, landing at Marsala in Sicily to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies ruled by the Bourbon dynasty.[^37]

The expedition was one of the most remarkable military campaigns in modern history. Garibaldi's thousand volunteers, drawn from across Italy and including 336 from contemporary Italian regions, 434 from Austrian-controlled Lombardy, and 194 from Venetia, faced a professional Bourbon army of over 20,000 troops.[^38] After successfully landing at Marsala on May 11, 1860, Garibaldi quickly garnered local support from Sicilians who hated their Neapolitan rulers.[^39] He defeated a Neapolitan force at Calatafimi on May 15 using his signature uphill bayonet charge, and many Sicilians then joined him.[^40] Aided also by the incompetence of the Bourbon command, Garibaldi captured Palermo on June 6 and, with the Battle of Milazzo on July 20, won control of all Sicily except Messina.[^41]

On August 20, he crossed the Strait of Messina and landed in Calabria, beginning his march toward Naples.[^42] His advance became a triumphal procession as Bourbon rule totally collapsed, and he was welcomed as a liberator on entering Naples on September 7.[^43] The volunteers, mostly businessmen, tradesmen, workingmen, students, artists, and others with little or no battle experience, had defeated a much larger professional army through superior leadership, guerrilla tactics, and the popular support they inspired.[^44] In October 1860, a plebiscite confirmed the annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia by an overwhelming majority.[^45]

The expedition concluded at Teano in northern Campania on October 26, 1860, when Garibaldi met King Victor Emmanuel II and, as a convinced republican, handed over power in the liberated south of Italy to the Savoy monarch.[^46] This act of self-denial, subordinating his republican ideals to the cause of Italian unity, was perhaps his greatest political achievement. By 1870, when Italian troops finally entered Rome, Garibaldi's dream of a unified Italy was realized, and the Eternal City became the capital of the new nation.[^47]

Beyond Italy, Garibaldi's military exploits earned international recognition. In July 1861, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln offered him a major general's commission to fight for the Union Army in the American Civil War.[^48] Though Garibaldi was flattered, he said he would only serve as commander-in-chief with the power to declare the abolition of slavery—conditions that could not be met since Lincoln was not yet ready to free the slaves and the Constitution reserved the commander-in-chief role for the president.[^49] After Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, Garibaldi wrote to him on August 6, 1863: "Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure."[^50]

In the fall of 1870, during the Franco-Prussan War, Garibaldi commanded the Army of the Vosges, a volunteer force formed to defend the road to Lyon from the Prussian Army after the proclamation of the French Third Republic.[^51] On January 21-23, 1871, when 4,000 Prussians attacked, Garibaldi's troops were victorious, and they seized a German regimental flag, supposedly one of only two flags taken from the enemy during the entire war.[^52] In February, Garibaldi was even elected to the French National Assembly as a representative of the Alpes-Maritimes department, though he resigned shortly afterward when the Assembly refused to hear him speak.[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his heroic reputation, Garibaldi was a controversial figure whose actions and character attracted significant criticism both from contemporaries and later historians. Many people regarded him as an embarrassment to the new Italian state, and he frequently opposed Prime Minister Cavour in parliament, accusing the government of shabby treatment of the volunteer soldiers who had conquered half the country.[^54] His dictatorship of southern Italy in 1860 was heavily criticized by contemporaries, though modern historians note it compares favorably with the administration that followed it.[^55]

On the 200th anniversary of his birth in 2007, some segments of public opinion chose to highlight his ruthlessness and cruelty rather than his heroism, revamping the debate over whether he was truly a hero or a villain.[^56] Revisionist historians have tended to negatively re-evaluate key figures of Italian national unity, including Garibaldi, challenging the hagiographic narratives that dominated for decades.[^57] The idealization of the unification movement was consciously pursued through the exaltation of figures like Garibaldi, sustained by a steady stream of hagiographic literature that often descended to absurd levels, such as placing commemorative plaques on sites where Garibaldi had merely stopped to bathe.[^58]

Garibaldi's political pragmatism and ideological contradictions troubled many observers. Karl Marx sometimes made derogatory comments toward Garibaldi, questioning the depth of his theoretical understanding.[^59] Garibaldi at times quarreled publicly and intensely with the other three Fathers of the Italian Fatherland—the King, Mazzini, and Cavour—and it is fair to say they often hated him.[^60] His break with Mazzini, his former mentor, was particularly painful. Garibaldi pragmatically allied himself with the monarchist Cavour and the Kingdom of Sardinia, subordinating his republican ideals to his nationalist goals—a decision Mazzini viewed as betrayal.[^61]

Garibaldi's relationship with Cavour was poisonous. He deeply distrusted Cavour's pragmatism and realpolitik, and bore a personal grudge because Cavour had traded away Garibaldi's home city of Nice to the French as part of a diplomatic bargain with Napoleon III.[^62] In April 1860, as deputy for Nice in the Piedmontese parliament at Turin, Garibaldi vehemently attacked Cavour for this cession.[^63] Cavour, for his part, feared that Garibaldi and his revolutionaries might establish a republic in southern Italy or invade the Papal States, which would have provoked French intervention.[^64]

Garibaldi's military leadership, while often brilliant, was not without failures. His attempts to capture Rome in 1862 and 1867 both failed, the latter ending with his defeat and capture at Mentana.[^65] His relationship with women also drew criticism—his marriage to 18-year-old Giuseppina Raimondi in January 1860 ended the same day when he learned she was pregnant with another man's child.[^66] His forceful personality and tendency toward autocratic decision-making sometimes alienated potential allies and complicated the political situation.

Moreover, the mythology surrounding Garibaldi often obscured a more complex reality. Giuseppe Guerzoni's serious 1882 biography of Garibaldi, written immediately after his death, described not only his virtues but also his very human flaws—a more balanced portrayal that was often ignored in favor of simple hero worship.[^67] The historical Garibaldi was a man of contradictions: a republican who supported a monarchy, a democrat who sometimes acted dictatorially, an internationalist who championed nationalism, and an idealist who made pragmatic compromises.

## Personal Life

Garibaldi's personal life was as dramatic and unconventional as his military career. He was married three times and had numerous children, and his romantic relationships were often intertwined with his revolutionary activities. His first and most legendary partnership was with Ana Maria de Jesus Ribeiro da Silva, known as Anita, whom he met during the Brazilian campaign in 1839.[^68] Garibaldi managed to elope with Anita, who was at the time a married woman, and she remained his companion in arms until her death.[^69] They married in Montevideo on March 26, 1842, and had four children who survived to adulthood: Menotti (born 1840), Rosita (born 1843), Teresita (born 1845), and Ricciotti (born 1847).[^70]

Anita was no ordinary wife—she fought alongside Garibaldi in battles at Imbituba and Laguna, demonstrating extraordinary courage and military prowess.[^71] Her death in 1849 during their epic retreat from Rome, while carrying their fifth child, was one of the greatest tragedies of Garibaldi's life.[^72] He never fully recovered from losing her, and she remained his great love, the standard against which all other relationships were measured.

Garibaldi's second marriage was brief and scandalous. On January 24, 1860, he married 18-year-old Giuseppina Raimondi, but soon after the ceremony he learned that she was pregnant with another man's child and immediately left her.[^73] This marriage was later annulled, but not until 1880, creating legal complications for two decades.

In 1865, Garibaldi hired Francesca Armosino, a woman from Piedmont, to help care for his daughter Teresita, who was ill.[^74] Francesca became his long-term companion on Caprera, and they had three children together: Clélia (born 1867), Rosa (born 1869, who died in 1871), and Manlio (born 1873).[^75] After finally obtaining the decree of nullity for his marriage to Giuseppina Raimondi in 1880, Garibaldi married Francesca, legitimizing their children.[^76] He spent his final years on Caprera with Francesca, their children, and other family members, finding some measure of domestic peace after decades of warfare.

Garibaldi's personality was complex and sometimes contradictory. He possessed tremendous personal charisma and the ability to inspire fierce loyalty in his followers. His simple radicalism sparked the first political awareness in many of his fellow countrymen and brought home to them the significance of nationality.[^77] Yet he could also be autocratic, impulsive, and stubborn. His political views evolved throughout his life, starting as a committed republican and ending with sympathy for socialism, though he never concentrated extensively on social reform.[^78]

On religious matters, Garibaldi was strongly anticlerical throughout his life, though he had been raised Catholic.[^79] In later life, he became a supporter of Freemasonry, abjured Christianity, and expressed religious positions reminiscent of deism and bordering on atheism.[^80] He was eventually elected as Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, viewing Freemasonry as a network that united progressive men across nations.[^81] His personal convictions were blunt—he wrote in 1882, "Man created God, not God Man," and called the Catholic Church "the cancer of Italy," writing that Italy's first need was "shaking the putrid funeral bier of the Vatican."[^82] Before his wedding in 1880, he stated he was not a Catholic and was willing to become a Protestant.[^83]

In 1879, Garibaldi founded the "League of Democracy," which advocated universal suffrage, female emancipation, the abolition of ecclesiastical property, and a standing army for national unity.[^84] These progressive positions reflected his commitment to democratic ideals and social justice, even as he grew old and infirm. Along with Mazzini, Garibaldi supported the creation of a European federation, showing his vision extended beyond Italian borders.[^85]

## Legacy

Giuseppe Garibaldi's legacy as one of the 19th century's most significant revolutionary figures and as a founder of modern Italy remains profound and multifaceted. He became an international figurehead for national independence and republican ideals, and is considered by twentieth-century historiography and popular culture as Italy's greatest national hero.[^86] Historian A.J.P. Taylor famously called him "the only wholly admirable figure in modern history"—high praise indeed from a notoriously critical scholar.[^87]

Garibaldi's influence on modern Italian identity has been enormous, shaping notions of nationalism, patriotism, and cultural representation that persist to this day.[^88] As Italy navigates contemporary challenges such as immigration, regional disparities, and globalization, Garibaldi's emphasis on unity and shared identity continues to serve as a guiding principle for fostering a cohesive society.[^89] His legacy encourages Italians to reflect on their history and to consider the implications of their identity in a rapidly changing world, making him relevant long after his death.

He became a symbol of heroism and dedication, revered as one of the founding fathers of modern Italy whose unwavering commitment to freedom and independence continues to inspire generations.[^90] His simple radicalism sparked the first political awareness in many of his fellow countrymen and brought home to them the significance of nationality, earning him an eminent place in Italian history.[^91] Today, countless streets, squares, and monuments throughout Italy bear his name, and his image appears in textbooks, popular culture, and political discourse.

Beyond Italy, Garibaldi's international influence was remarkable. He was showered with admiration and praise by many contemporary intellectuals and political figures, including Abraham Lincoln, William Brown, Francesco de Sanctis, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Malwida von Meysenbug, George Sand, Charles Dickens, and Friedrich Engels.[^92] Garibaldi also inspired later revolutionary figures like Jawaharlal Nehru and Che Guevara, who saw in him a model of the charismatic guerrilla leader fighting for national liberation.[^93]

His reputation as the "Hero of the Two Worlds" for his military enterprises in South America and Europe gave him a global dimension that few 19th-century figures could match.[^94] His mastery of guerrilla warfare influenced military thinking and provided a template for later revolutionary movements around the world. The image of Garibaldi and his Redshirts—volunteers fighting against overwhelming odds for the cause of liberty—became an enduring romantic symbol that transcended national boundaries.

Garibaldi's legacy is also preserved in the physical landscape. The island of Caprera, where he lived for about 26 years and where he personally took care of the cultivation of fields and orchards, has become a pilgrimage site and museum.[^95] Visitors can see the "white house" he had built in the style of South American farms, the fields where he planted trees, and the estate where he bred chickens, sheep, horses, and donkeys (to whom he amusingly gave his enemies' names).[^96]

The continuing relevance of Garibaldi lies not only in his military achievements but in what he represented: the possibility that dedication, courage, and idealism could triumph over entrenched power; that a single individual with vision and determination could change the course of history; and that national unity and freedom were worth any sacrifice. Whether viewed as a hero or a more complicated figure with flaws and contradictions, Garibaldi remains an inescapable presence in the story of modern Europe and the global history of revolutionary movements.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers have consistently praised Garibaldi's extraordinary military genius, selfless dedication to Italian unity, and personal charisma. He is universally acknowledged as one of the great masters of guerrilla warfare, whose innovative tactics and inspirational leadership were responsible for most of the military victories of the Risorgimento.[^97] His contribution as a propagandist and symbol was almost equally important to his battlefield achievements, making him indispensable to the unification cause.[^98]

Historians emphasize that through his conquest of Sicily and Naples with his guerrilla Redshirts, Garibaldi contributed decisively to the achievement of Italian unification under the royal house of Savoy.[^99] The Expedition of the Thousand stands as one of the most remarkable military campaigns in modern history—approximately 1,000 poorly equipped volunteers defeating a professional army of over 20,000 troops through superior leadership, tactics, and the popular support they inspired.[^100] This achievement demonstrated that military genius and popular enthusiasm could overcome numerical and material disadvantages.

Many scholars have praised Garibaldi's act of self-denial at Teano, where he handed over his conquests to King Victor Emmanuel II rather than establishing himself as dictator or attempting to create a southern republic.[^101] This demonstrated a commitment to Italian unity that transcended personal ambition—a rare quality among military commanders who have conquered kingdoms. His political pragmatism, while criticized by some, is viewed by others as essential wisdom, recognizing that a united Italy under monarchy was preferable to continued division and foreign domination.

Garibaldi's progressive political views—supporting universal suffrage, female emancipation, the abolition of ecclesiastical property, and workers' rights—mark him as ahead of his time.[^102] His internationalism, demonstrated by fighting for liberty in South America, France, and offering to fight in the American Civil War for the abolition of slavery, showed a vision that transcended narrow nationalism.[^103] He became a symbol not just of Italian unity but of universal human freedom and dignity.

Contemporary admirers recognized his unique qualities. Abraham Lincoln considered him worthy of high command, Victor Hugo praised him, and numerous European intellectuals celebrated his achievements.[^104] Historian A.J.P. Taylor's assessment of him as "the only wholly admirable figure in modern history" reflects the view that Garibaldi's combination of military skill, personal courage, political idealism, and ultimate selflessness placed him in a category of his own.[^105] Unlike many revolutionary leaders who became dictators or pursued personal power, Garibaldi consistently subordinated his own interests to the larger cause.

Defenders of Garibaldi point out that his dictatorship of southern Italy in 1860, though criticized at the time, compares favorably with the administration that followed and was necessary given the circumstances of conquest and the need to maintain order during transition.[^106] His conflicts with Cavour and others reflected genuine differences in vision and approach rather than mere personal animosity, and his willingness to work with those he disagreed with demonstrated political maturity.

### Negative Views

Critics and revisionist historians have challenged the hagiographic narratives surrounding Garibaldi, pointing to his ruthlessness, political naiveté, and the negative consequences of some of his actions. The idealization of Garibaldi was consciously pursued through deliberate mythmaking and a steady stream of hagiographic literature that often reached absurd levels, creating an image disconnected from the complex historical reality.[^107]

On the 200th anniversary of his birth in 2007, some scholars and commentators chose to highlight his ruthlessness and cruelty rather than his heroism, questioning whether he deserved uncritical veneration.[^108] Revisionist historians have negatively re-evaluated key figures of Italian national unity, including Garibaldi, arguing that the unification process was more violent, chaotic, and problematic than traditional narratives suggest.[^109]

Garibaldi's political contradictions troubled many observers. Karl Marx made derogatory comments about him, questioning the depth of his theoretical understanding and viewing his actions as politically unsophisticated.[^110] Mazzini was devastated by Garibaldi's abandonment of republican principles and alliance with the Savoy monarchy, seeing it as a betrayal of their shared ideals.[^111] The fact that Garibaldi quarreled publicly and intensely with the other three Fathers of the Italian Fatherland—Victor Emmanuel II, Mazzini, and Cavour—and that they often hated him, suggests a personality that was difficult and divisive.[^112]

Critics point to his military failures, including his unsuccessful attempts to capture Rome in 1862 and 1867, with the latter ending in defeat and capture at Mentana.[^113] These failures revealed limitations in his military judgment and his tendency to let idealism override practical considerations. His dictatorship of southern Italy, while defended by some historians, involved authoritarian methods that contradicted his democratic rhetoric.

Garibaldi's personal life also drew criticism. His scandalous second marriage to Giuseppina Raimondi, which ended the same day when he discovered her pregnancy by another man, revealed poor judgment and impulsive decision-making.[^114] His forceful personality and autocratic tendencies sometimes alienated allies and complicated the political situation. The truth, as one scholar noted, is that "the life of this pirate who became a general, the republican who supported the Savoyard monarchy, the Freemason and populist, internationalist and individualist, does not fit any neat categories of party politics or even class struggle."[^115]

Some historians argue that Garibaldi's symbolic importance obscured more substantive contributions by others, particularly Cavour, whose diplomatic skill and political acumen were essential to unification but received less popular acclaim.[^116] The romanticization of Garibaldi and his Redshirts created unrealistic expectations about revolutionary change and minimized the importance of careful political planning and compromise.

His extreme anticlericalism, while reflecting genuine liberal sentiment, created unnecessary conflicts and alienated many Catholics who might otherwise have supported unification.[^117] His attacks on the Church as "the cancer of Italy" and his desire to destroy the Vatican were inflammatory and counterproductive, making reconciliation between the Italian state and the Catholic Church more difficult and contributing to decades of tension.

Finally, critics note that despite his progressive rhetoric, Garibaldi never concentrated seriously on social reform, and his sympathy for socialism came late and remained largely rhetorical.[^118] The Italy that emerged from unification was marked by profound social and economic inequalities, particularly between north and south, that Garibaldi's military victories did little to address. His focus on national unity and political independence, while important, came at the expense of attention to the social and economic justice that many Italians desperately needed.
