## Summary

Lu Xun (1881-1936), born Zhou Shuren, is widely regarded as the founder of modern Chinese literature and one of the most influential writers in 20th-century China[^1]. His biting satirical essays and short stories, including the iconic "A Madman's Diary" and "The True Story of Ah Q," exposed the deep-rooted problems of traditional Chinese culture and society during a period of profound transformation[^2]. A fierce critic of Confucian tradition and feudal society, Lu Xun used literature as a weapon to awaken the Chinese people to social injustice and cultural stagnation[^3]. His works bridged traditional Chinese literary forms and Western modernist techniques, creating a new vernacular literature that would shape Chinese intellectual discourse for generations[^4]. Despite never joining the Communist Party, Lu Xun became a symbolic figure for the Chinese left and was later canonized by Mao Zedong as a revolutionary cultural hero[^5].

## Early Life and Background

Lu Xun was born Zhou Shuren on September 25, 1881, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, into a scholarly family that had fallen on hard times[^6]. His grandfather, Zhou Fuqing, was a successful imperial examination candidate who served as an official, but the family's fortunes collapsed when his grandfather was imprisoned for attempting to bribe examination officials when Lu Xun was thirteen[^7]. This traumatic experience of social disgrace deeply influenced Lu Xun's later critiques of China's examination system and traditional society[^8].

Growing up during the final decades of the Qing Dynasty, Lu Xun witnessed China's humiliating defeats by foreign powers and the desperate attempts at modernization[^9]. His early education followed traditional Confucian lines, studying classical texts and preparing for the imperial examinations, but the family's disgrace ended those aspirations[^10]. The young Zhou Shuren also witnessed his father's prolonged illness and death, an experience that exposed him to the inadequacies of traditional Chinese medicine and the exploitation by quack doctors—themes that would later appear in his fiction[^11].

In 1898, at age seventeen, Lu Xun left Shaoxing to study at the Jiangnan Naval Academy in Nanjing, marking his first step toward Western learning[^12]. He later transferred to the School of Mines and Railways, where he was exposed to evolutionary theory, particularly the social Darwinism of Thomas Huxley and Herbert Spencer, which profoundly shaped his worldview[^13]. These ideas convinced him that China's survival depended on fundamental cultural and social transformation, not merely technological adoption[^14].

In 1902, Lu Xun received a scholarship to study in Japan, joining thousands of Chinese students seeking modern knowledge abroad[^15]. He initially enrolled in medical school at Sendai Medical Academy, hoping to strengthen the Chinese people physically[^16]. However, a transformative incident changed his life's direction: during a slide show depicting Japanese soldiers executing a Chinese man accused of spying for Russia, while other Chinese looked on apathetically, Lu Xun realized that China's fundamental problem was spiritual and cultural, not physical[^17]. He abandoned medicine to pursue literature, believing that awakening the Chinese spirit was more urgent than healing Chinese bodies[^18].

## Rise to Prominence

After leaving medical school, Lu Xun spent several years in Tokyo studying literature, philosophy, and foreign languages, immersing himself in European literature, particularly Russian and Eastern European writers[^19]. He translated works by Jules Verne, Gogol, and other authors, hoping to introduce Chinese readers to world literature[^20]. During this period, he developed his critical perspective on traditional Chinese culture, influenced by Nietzschean ideas about cultural renewal and the importance of the individual[^21].

Lu Xun returned to China in 1909, a time of revolutionary ferment leading up to the 1911 Revolution that would overthrow the Qing Dynasty[^22]. He worked as a teacher in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, but found these years frustrating and unproductive[^23]. After the revolution failed to bring the anticipated transformation, Lu Xun fell into a period of depression and disillusionment, copying ancient inscriptions and manuscripts as an escape from confronting China's seemingly intractable problems[^24].

The turning point came in 1918 when Lu Xun, then working at the Ministry of Education in Beijing, was persuaded by friends to contribute to the progressive magazine *New Youth*, the flagship publication of the New Culture Movement[^25]. His first modern short story, "A Madman's Diary" (*Kuangren Riji*), published in May 1918 under the pen name Lu Xun, marked a revolutionary moment in Chinese literature[^26]. Written entirely in vernacular Chinese rather than classical literary Chinese, the story told of a paranoid narrator who believes everyone around him is a cannibal, serving as a searing allegory for traditional Chinese society's consumption of individuals[^27].

"A Madman's Diary" was immediately recognized as groundbreaking, establishing Lu Xun as the leading voice of modern Chinese literature[^28]. The story's famous conclusion—"Save the children..."—became a rallying cry for cultural reformers[^29]. This was followed by other masterpieces including "Kong Yiji" (1919), about a failed scholar destroyed by the examination system, and "Medicine" (1919), a story interweaving the execution of a revolutionary with the superstitious use of human blood as medicine[^30].

In 1921, Lu Xun published "The True Story of Ah Q" (*Ah Q Zhengzhuan*), which became his most famous work[^31]. This novella depicted a hapless, self-deluding peasant who transforms every defeat into a "spiritual victory," serving as a devastating critique of the Chinese national character[^32]. The character Ah Q entered the Chinese lexicon as a symbol of self-deception and false consciousness[^33]. Through Ah Q, Lu Xun argued that China's problems stemmed not just from political oppression or economic backwardness, but from deep psychological and cultural defects that perpetuated submission and prevented genuine revolution[^34].

Throughout the 1920s, Lu Xun's reputation grew as he published two influential short story collections: *Call to Arms* (*Nahan*, 1923) and *Wandering* (*Panghuang*, 1926)[^35]. His essays, collected in volumes like *Hot Wind* (*Re Feng*, 1925), established him as China's most incisive social critic[^36]. His writing style combined classical erudition with vernacular directness, bitter satire with compassionate humanism, making him uniquely effective at exposing social hypocrisies[^37].

## Major Achievements

Lu Xun's greatest achievement was establishing modern Chinese literature as a vehicle for social criticism and cultural awakening[^38]. Before Lu Xun, Chinese fiction was largely considered entertainment for the uneducated, while serious literature meant classical poetry and essays[^39]. Lu Xun transformed fiction into a respected form of intellectual discourse, demonstrating that vernacular stories could carry profound philosophical and social messages[^40].

His literary technique synthesized Chinese and Western traditions in innovative ways[^41]. He drew on classical Chinese novels like *The Scholars* (*Rulin Waishi*) and *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* (*Liaozhai Zhiyi*) while incorporating techniques from European modernism, particularly expressionism and psychological realism[^42]. Stories like "The New Year's Sacrifice" combined traditional narrative structures with modern psychological depth, creating a distinctively Chinese modernism[^43].

As a translator, Lu Xun introduced Chinese readers to a wide range of world literature, particularly from "oppressed nations" like Russia and Eastern Europe[^44]. His translations included works by Gogol, Chekhov, Andreev, and numerous Japanese authors, expanding Chinese literary horizons beyond the dominant British and French models[^45]. He believed that literature from societies experiencing similar struggles against backwardness could provide more relevant models for China than works from dominant Western powers[^46].

Lu Xun's essays and *zawen* (satirical sketches) created a new genre of pointed social commentary that became central to modern Chinese intellectual discourse[^47]. Collections like *Grave* (*Fenmu*, 1927), *Wild Grass* (*Yecao*, 1927), and *Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk* (*Zhaohua Xishi*, 1928) demonstrated his range from philosophical prose poetry to biting political satire[^48]. His essay style—ironic, allusive, and devastatingly precise—influenced generations of Chinese writers[^49].

In the realm of cultural criticism, Lu Xun's analysis of the "Chinese national character" became foundational for modern Chinese intellectual discourse[^50]. Unlike earlier reformers who blamed China's problems on specific institutions or political systems, Lu Xun insisted that fundamental cultural and psychological transformation was necessary[^51]. His critiques of Confucian filial piety, the examination system, traditional medicine, and social conformity challenged the deepest assumptions of Chinese civilization[^52].

Lu Xun also made significant contributions to art history and criticism, particularly regarding Chinese woodcut prints[^53]. In the 1930s, he championed the modern woodcut movement, seeing it as a democratic art form accessible to ordinary people and suitable for revolutionary propaganda[^54]. He organized exhibitions, published collections of international woodcuts, and mentored young artists, helping establish woodcut prints as a major form of modern Chinese art[^55].

His pedagogical influence extended through his teaching positions at various universities, including Peking University, where he taught Chinese literary history and influenced a generation of writers and intellectuals[^56]. Students remembered him as a demanding but inspiring teacher who insisted on rigorous thinking and intellectual honesty[^57].

Lu Xun's editorial work for various progressive magazines helped create spaces for new literary voices and experimental writing[^58]. He supported younger writers, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds, and used his reputation to defend them against political persecution[^59]. His encouragement was crucial for writers like Ding Ling, Xiao Hong, and numerous others who became major figures in Chinese literature[^60].

Perhaps his most lasting achievement was demonstrating that literature could be both artistically sophisticated and politically engaged without sacrificing either dimension[^61]. His works combined aesthetic innovation with moral urgency, proving that commitment to social change need not result in crude propaganda[^62]. This model influenced not just Chinese writers but intellectuals throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America seeking to create socially relevant national literatures[^63].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revered status, Lu Xun was a controversial figure during his lifetime and his legacy remains contested[^64]. His relentless negativity toward Chinese culture drew criticism from various quarters, with some arguing that his blanket condemnations damaged Chinese cultural confidence and national pride[^65]. Critics suggested that his emphasis on China's failings, while perhaps necessary during the 1920s, created a self-hating discourse that persisted long after it ceased to be productive[^66].

Conservative intellectuals accused Lu Xun of cultural nihilism, arguing that his wholesale rejection of Chinese tradition left nothing to build upon[^67]. The prominent scholar Lin Yutang, initially a friend of Lu Xun, later criticized him for being destructive without offering constructive alternatives[^68]. Others argued that his embrace of Western literary forms and ideas represented a capitulation to cultural imperialism rather than genuine modernization[^69].

Lu Xun's political evolution toward the left, particularly his association with the League of Left-Wing Writers in the 1930s, alienated some former allies and made him a target of Nationalist government surveillance[^70]. Though he never joined the Communist Party and maintained critical independence, his sympathies with Marxist analysis and his attacks on the Kuomintang regime led to accusations that he was a communist sympathizer who prioritized ideology over truth[^71].

His personal life also generated controversy, particularly his treatment of his first wife, Zhu An[^72]. The marriage had been arranged by his mother while Lu Xun was in Japan, and he never accepted Zhu An as a true partner, reportedly not consummating the marriage[^73]. When he fell in love with his student Xu Guangping and established a relationship with her, he did not divorce Zhu An, who continued living in his household[^74]. This arrangement, while not uncommon in transitional Republican China, seemed to contradict his progressive values regarding women's liberation and individual autonomy[^75].

Lu Xun's caustic personality and tendency toward bitter feuds damaged relationships with numerous contemporaries[^76]. His attacks on former friends and colleagues—including vicious polemics against writers like Liang Shiqiu, Hu Shi, and the Crescent Moon Society—struck many as excessive and personally vindictive[^77]. Critics argued that his satirical cruelty sometimes crossed into bullying, using his superior rhetorical skills to humiliate opponents rather than engage their arguments[^78].

Some literary critics have questioned whether Lu Xun's reputation exceeds his actual literary achievement[^79]. They note that he wrote only a few dozen short stories and abandoned fiction after 1926, devoting his later years primarily to essays and translations[^80]. Compared to the voluminous output of writers like Balzac or Tolstoy whom he admired, Lu Xun's fictional corpus is relatively small[^81]. Some argue that his canonical status owes more to political factors—particularly his anointing by Mao Zedong—than to purely literary merit[^82].

His pessimistic worldview and dark depictions of Chinese peasants and common people drew criticism for lacking faith in the masses[^83]. Unlike revolutionary writers who idealized workers and peasants, Lu Xun portrayed them as ignorant, superstitious, and complicit in their own oppression[^84]. Some Marxist critics argued this revealed his fundamentally petty-bourgeois perspective, unable to see the revolutionary potential in the Chinese people[^85].

Post-Mao reassessments have also questioned aspects of Lu Xun's political judgment, particularly his defense of the Soviet Union even as evidence of Stalinist purges emerged[^86]. His attacks on "third category" writers who sought independence from both Nationalist and Communist political control have been criticized as intolerant of pluralism[^87]. Some scholars suggest his binary thinking—dividing the world rigidly into progressive and reactionary forces—limited his political wisdom despite his literary brilliance[^88].

## Personal Life

Lu Xun's personal life was marked by melancholy, complicated family relationships, and intense intellectual friendships[^89]. He never fully recovered from the trauma of his family's disgrace during his youth, which left him with a permanent sense of alienation from traditional Chinese society[^90]. Friends and students described him as reserved, occasionally warm with intimates but generally maintaining emotional distance[^91].

His relationship with his mother was dutiful but not close, particularly after she arranged his marriage to Zhu An in 1906[^92]. Lu Xun submitted to the marriage out of filial obligation but resented it deeply, later writing that he had been "sacrificed" to tradition[^93]. Zhu An, an illiterate woman with bound feet, represented everything Lu Xun rejected about old China, yet he supported her financially throughout his life and never publicly humiliated her[^94].

The great love of Lu Xun's life was Xu Guangping, a student twenty years his junior whom he met when teaching at Beijing Women's Normal University[^95]. Their relationship began as an intellectual correspondence in 1925 and developed into a romantic partnership after Lu Xun moved to Shanghai in 1927[^96]. Xu Guangping was an educated, progressive woman who shared Lu Xun's political views and became his intellectual companion and literary collaborator[^97]. They had one son, Zhou Haiying, born in 1929, whom Lu Xun adored[^98].

Lu Xun's domestic arrangements reflected the contradictions of transitional China: he lived with Xu Guangping and their son while his legal wife Zhu An remained in Beijing, supported by remittances[^99]. This arrangement satisfied no one fully but represented Lu Xun's attempt to balance traditional obligations with modern desires[^100]. His refusal to divorce Zhu An stemmed partly from concern for her welfare—she would have had no support system without the marriage—and partly from reluctance to cause his elderly mother additional distress[^101].

In personality, Lu Xun was known for his dry wit, love of tobacco, and modest lifestyle[^102]. Despite his literary fame, he lived simply, donating much of his income to support young writers and political causes[^103]. He was a devoted collector of ancient stone rubbings and woodblock prints, finding solace in these antiquarian pursuits when disillusioned with contemporary politics[^104].

Friends remembered Lu Xun as capable of great kindness, particularly toward struggling young people, but also as someone who held grudges and could be unforgiving toward those he considered hypocrites[^105]. His sense of humor was dark and ironic; he once joked that his writings were like "dagger and spear" meant to wound enemies but acknowledged they were probably more like "fluttering flies" that merely annoyed people[^106].

Lu Xun suffered from poor health throughout his life, particularly tuberculosis and chronic respiratory problems exacerbated by heavy smoking[^107]. In his final years, he continued writing despite declining health, producing some of his most bitter and powerful essays[^108]. He died on October 19, 1936, at age 55 from tuberculosis, with his last words reportedly being a request that Xu Guangping not let their son become "an empty literatus"[^109].

His funeral in Shanghai drew massive crowds, with his coffin draped in a banner reading "Soul of the Nation," reflecting his status as a cultural icon even before the Communist Party later elevated him to almost saintly status[^110]. Xu Guangping devoted the rest of her life to preserving and promoting Lu Xun's legacy, editing his collected works and defending his reputation[^111].

## Legacy

Lu Xun's legacy in modern Chinese culture is nearly impossible to overstate—he remains the most influential writer in 20th-century China and arguably the most important intellectual figure of the Republican era[^112]. His transformation of the Chinese language, creating a vernacular literary style that could express modern consciousness, fundamentally shaped how Chinese people think and write[^113]. Before Lu Xun, vernacular Chinese was considered unsuitable for serious literature; after him, it became the standard for all modern writing[^114].

His canonization by Mao Zedong in the famous 1940 essay "On New Democracy," which proclaimed Lu Xun "the greatest and the most courageous standard-bearer of this new cultural force" and "not only a great man of letters but a great thinker and revolutionary," ensured his central place in Communist China's cultural pantheon[^115]. During the Mao era, Lu Xun's works were prescribed reading for all Chinese students, his essays excerpted in textbooks, and his image appearing on stamps and currency[^116].

This official endorsement was both blessing and curse[^117]. While it preserved Lu Xun's works when many other Republican-era writers were suppressed, it also led to simplification of his complex thought into crude revolutionary slogans[^118]. The Communist Party claimed Lu Xun as a proto-communist, ignoring his independence, his criticisms of dogmatism, and his refusal to join the party[^119]. Scholars during the Mao era had to interpret Lu Xun through Marxist-Leninist frameworks, distorting his thought[^120].

Since the 1980s, Chinese scholars have attempted to "return the real Lu Xun," recovering his complexity and contradictions from layers of political interpretation[^121]. This project has revealed Lu Xun as a more interesting, conflicted figure than the revolutionary saint of Maoist hagiography[^122]. Contemporary scholars emphasize his individualism, his debt to Nietzsche and expressionism, his dark pessimism, and his resistance to easy categorization[^123].

Lu Xun's influence on Chinese literature extends through multiple generations of writers[^124]. Nearly every major modern Chinese writer, from Mao Dun and Ba Jin in the 1930s to Mo Yan and Yu Hua in contemporary times, has acknowledged Lu Xun's influence[^125]. His techniques—satirical allegory, psychological realism, the use of traditional narrative frames to convey modern themes—became standard tools for Chinese fiction[^126].

Beyond China, Lu Xun has influenced writers throughout Asia and the developing world[^127]. His model of using literature to critique backward traditions while resisting Western cultural imperialism resonated with postcolonial intellectuals in India, Africa, and Latin America[^128]. Writers like Pramoedya Ananta Toer in Indonesia and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in Kenya have cited Lu Xun as an inspiration for creating politically engaged national literatures[^129].

In academic circles, Lu Xun studies constitute a major field within Chinese literary scholarship, with thousands of books and articles analyzing every aspect of his work[^130]. International scholars have produced important studies examining Lu Xun through various theoretical frameworks—psychoanalysis, postcolonialism, comparative literature, translation studies—demonstrating the richness of his texts[^131].

Museums dedicated to Lu Xun exist in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shaoxing, preserving his manuscripts, letters, and personal effects[^132]. His former residences have become pilgrimage sites for literary tourists, and his birthplace in Shaoxing is a major cultural heritage site[^133]. The Lu Xun Literary Prize, established in 1997, is one of China's most prestigious literary awards[^134].

However, Lu Xun's relevance in contemporary China is debated[^135]. Some argue that his dark vision of Chinese culture, while perhaps necessary during the crisis of the early 20th century, is outdated in an era of Chinese national revival[^136]. Nationalist intellectuals suggest that China needs confidence-building narratives, not Lu Xun's relentless criticism[^137]. Yet others argue that Lu Xun's skepticism toward power, his defense of individual conscience against group-think, and his satirical exposure of hypocrisy remain urgently relevant[^138].

In recent years, Lu Xun's essays criticizing conformity, attacking powerful officials, and defending free expression have found new audiences on Chinese social media, where his acerbic quotes are frequently shared as commentary on contemporary issues[^139]. This underground digital afterlife suggests that Lu Xun's critical spirit continues to inspire resistance to authority, even when official discourse has sanitized him into a safe cultural icon[^140].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Lu Xun celebrate him as the conscience of modern China, a writer who refused to compromise his critical vision despite personal cost[^141]. The literary scholar C.T. Hsia, in his influential *A History of Modern Chinese Fiction*, called Lu Xun "the one Chinese writer of the first magnitude in the twentieth century" whose works possessed "a tragic intensity matched by no other Chinese writer of his time"[^142]. Hsia praised Lu Xun's psychological depth, his mastery of both classical and vernacular Chinese, and his ability to create universal symbols from specifically Chinese materials[^143].

Scholars emphasize Lu Xun's intellectual courage in attacking not just specific political problems but the deepest foundations of Chinese culture at a time when such criticism was considered treason[^144]. Unlike reformers who blamed China's problems on the Manchu Qing Dynasty or Western imperialism, Lu Xun insisted that Chinese people examine their own cultural complicity in perpetuating oppression[^145]. This willingness to challenge comfortable narratives, supporters argue, represented the highest form of patriotism—loving one's country enough to demand it confront painful truths[^146].

Literary critics praise the artistic sophistication of Lu Xun's fiction, noting how he avoided the propagandistic tendencies that marred much "progressive" literature of his era[^147]. Stories like "The New Year's Sacrifice" and "In the Wine Shop" combined social criticism with genuine literary artistry—complex narrative structures, subtle characterization, and ambiguous endings that resist simple interpretation[^148]. Even his most politically charged works, like "The True Story of Ah Q," transcend their immediate historical context to address universal human weaknesses[^149].

Progressive Chinese intellectuals credit Lu Xun with establishing critical thinking as a cultural value in modern China[^150]. His insistence on skeptical inquiry, his attacks on blind tradition, and his defense of individual conscience against collective pressure created space for independent intellectuals in an increasingly polarized political environment[^151]. During both the Nationalist and Communist eras, Lu Xun's example provided legitimacy for writers and scholars who sought to maintain critical distance from official ideology[^152].

Feminist scholars have recognized Lu Xun as an early male ally who consistently championed women's rights and critiqued patriarchy[^153]. Stories like "The New Year's Sacrifice" and "Regret for the Past" explored how traditional family structures destroyed women's lives, while his essays attacked foot-binding, arranged marriage, and Confucian restrictions on women[^154]. His relationship with Xu Guangping, whom he treated as an intellectual equal, modeled a more egalitarian partnership than was common among his male contemporaries[^155].

International scholars have praised Lu Xun as one of the great world writers of the 20th century, comparable to Kafka, Joyce, or Borges in his innovative literary techniques and profound exploration of modernity's discontents[^156]. Comparative literature scholars note parallels between Lu Xun's alienated intellectuals and similar figures in European modernism, while acknowledging his distinctive Chinese voice[^157]. His works have been translated into dozens of languages, with major scholarly editions in English, Japanese, Russian, and other languages ensuring his place in world literature[^158].

Defenders of Lu Xun's legacy argue that attempts to move "beyond" his critical perspective often represent retreat into comfortable nationalism rather than genuine progress[^159]. They maintain that the problems Lu Xun identified—conformity, hypocrisy, abuse of power, superstition, and the crushing of individuality—remain present in Chinese society and require continued vigilance[^160]. From this view, Lu Xun's pessimism was not psychological defect but clear-eyed realism about how difficult fundamental social change truly is[^161].

---

### Negative Views

Critics of Lu Xun, both during his lifetime and subsequently, have challenged various aspects of his work and legacy[^162]. Some Chinese intellectuals argue that his wholesale condemnation of traditional Chinese culture was excessive and damaging, contributing to a crisis of cultural confidence that weakened China rather than strengthened it[^163]. The philosopher and cultural critic Yu Yingshi suggested that Lu Xun's blanket rejection of Confucianism failed to distinguish between valuable ethical insights and oppressive social practices, throwing out the baby with the bathwater[^164].

Literary critics have questioned whether Lu Xun's reputation owes more to his political symbolism than to purely literary achievement[^165]. They note that he wrote relatively few works of fiction and abandoned the genre after 1926, devoting his later years to polemical essays and translations[^166]. Some argue that works like "The True Story of Ah Q," while culturally significant, are artistically inferior to the great novels of world literature, relying too heavily on caricature and allegory rather than fully realized characterization[^167].

Conservative and nationalist intellectuals criticize Lu Xun for promoting cultural self-hatred that persisted long after it ceased to be useful[^168]. They argue that his dark depictions of Chinese peasants and common people encouraged educated Chinese to view their own culture with contempt, facilitating Western cultural imperialism and undermining national solidarity[^169]. From this perspective, Lu Xun's legacy includes the unfortunate tendency among Chinese intellectuals to romanticize the West while denigrating their own civilization[^170].

Some scholars have challenged the cult of Lu Xun promoted by the Communist Party, arguing that his canonization reflected political utility rather than objective assessment[^171]. They note that Mao Zedong's praise of Lu Xun served to legitimize the party's claim to represent authentic Chinese culture while suppressing actual dissent[^172]. The irony that a writer who valued independence and critical thinking became a mandatory icon for a totalitarian regime has not been lost on critics[^173].

Political moderates criticized Lu Xun's increasing radicalization in the 1930s, particularly his attacks on writers seeking middle positions between Nationalist and Communist extremes[^174]. His denunciation of the "third category" writers, who advocated artistic freedom independent of political parties, struck critics as intolerant and contrary to the pluralism he claimed to support[^175]. Some former allies felt that Lu Xun's leftward movement led him to subordinate literary judgment to political loyalty, defending mediocre works because of their correct political line while attacking superior works by writers on the wrong side[^176].

Psychological critics have suggested that Lu Xun's bitter worldview reflected personal pathology rather than objective social analysis[^177]. They point to his troubled family background, his failed arranged marriage, and his tendency toward depression as sources of the pervasive darkness in his works[^178]. From this view, Lu Xun projected his personal demons onto Chinese society, mistaking his individual alienation for universal truth[^179].

Some feminist scholars, while acknowledging Lu Xun's progressive views on women's issues, have noted limitations in his perspective[^180]. They argue that his depictions of women often reduced them to victims without agency, and that his personal treatment of Zhu An—maintaining an unwanted marriage while establishing a household with Xu Guangping—revealed conventional male privilege beneath his progressive rhetoric[^181]. His failure to grant Zhu An the divorce that would have freed her to potentially remarry suggested that his feminism had limits when it conflicted with his convenience[^182].

Contemporary critics have questioned Lu Xun's relevance to 21st-century China, arguing that his obsession with China's backwardness and weakness is outdated in an era of Chinese resurgence[^183]. They suggest that continued veneration of Lu Xun's critical stance prevents Chinese culture from developing the confidence necessary for genuine creativity, trapping Chinese intellectuals in reactive postures defined against the West[^184]. From this perspective, moving beyond Lu Xun means transcending both uncritical traditionalism and self-flagellating modernism to forge a genuinely contemporary Chinese culture[^185].
