## Summary

This is considered one of the most scientifically validated UFO cases. In 1981, a farmer named **Renato Nicolai** saw a metallic saucer land in his garden. It stayed for nearly a minute before flying off.

What makes this unique is the immediate response by the French Gendarmerie and **GEPAN** (France's official UFO investigation unit under the Space Agency CNES). They collected soil samples within hours. The labs verified the ground had been heated to 600°C and compacted by 4 tons of weight, and the plants showed biochemical aging consistent with exposure to strong electromagnetic fields.[^1]

## The Evidence

### Physical Traces
*   **Compression:** A circular ring imprint was found. Analysis showed it was made by a heavy object (4-5 tons).
*   **Thermal Shock:** The soil was scorched but not charred, indicating rapid heating (microwaves?).
*   **Biological:** Alfalfa plants near the landing site had 30-50% less chlorophyll and showed signs of "premature aging," linked to distance from the epicenter.

### Official Conclusion
The GEPAN report concluded it was a "strong mechanical pressure" and "thermal heating" event caused by an unidentified craft. It remains unexplained.
