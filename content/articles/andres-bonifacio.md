## Summary

Andrés Bonifacio y de Castro (November 30, 1863 – May 10, 1897) was a Filipino revolutionary leader often called "The Father of the Philippine Revolution" and considered a national hero of the Philippines.[^1] Born into poverty in Tondo, Manila, Bonifacio founded the Katipunan in 1892, a secret revolutionary society that sought independence from Spanish colonial rule through armed revolt.[^2] Despite his pivotal role in sparking the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Bonifacio's leadership was challenged at the Tejeros Convention in 1897, where he lost the presidency to Emilio Aguinaldo.[^3] He was subsequently arrested, tried for treason, and executed on May 10, 1897, making him both a revolutionary hero and a tragic victim of internal political conflict.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Andrés Bonifacio was born on November 30, 1863, in Tondo, Manila, the first of six children born to Catalina de Castro and Santiago Bonifacio.[^5] His mother, Catalina de Castro, was a tornatrás from Zambales with partial Spanish ancestry, while his father, Santiago Bonifacio, was a native of Taguig with Chinese heritage.[^6] The family lived in humble circumstances, with his father working as a tailor and his mother employed as a cigarette factory worker.[^7] His parents named him after Saint Andrew the Apostle, the patron saint of Manila, on whose feast day he was born.[^8]

Bonifacio's formal education was limited and interrupted by family tragedy. He learned the alphabet from his aunt and was enrolled in Guillermo Osmeña's private elementary school and also in Escuela Municipal de Niños on Calle Ilaya in Tondo.[^9] He reached the third year in a private secondary school in Manila before circumstances forced him to abandon his studies.[^10] When both his parents died in the 1870s, the young Bonifacio was forced to leave school to support his five younger siblings: brothers Ciriaco, Procopio, and Troadio, and sisters Espiridina and Maxima.[^11]

To support his family financially, Bonifacio and his young siblings made and sold walking canes and paper fans.[^12] Despite his lack of formal education, Bonifacio possessed a keen intellect and turned to self-education through voracious reading. He enriched his natural intelligence by reading books about the French Revolution, contemporary Philippine penal and civil codes, and biographies of Presidents of the United States.[^13] He was particularly influenced by Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables," Eugene Sue's "Le Juif errant," and most importantly, José Rizal's novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule.[^14]

In his late teens, Bonifacio first worked either as an agent or mandatario (messenger) for the British trading firm Fleming and Company, where he rose to become a corredor (broker) of tar, rattan, and other goods.[^15] He later transferred to the German trading firm Fressell and Company, where he worked as a bodeguero (storehouse keeper) responsible for warehouse inventory.[^16] These positions provided him with a modest but stable income and exposed him to international trade and foreign perspectives, broadening his worldview beyond the confines of colonial Manila.

## Rise to Power

Bonifacio's transformation from warehouse worker to revolutionary leader began with his exposure to reformist and nationalist ideas. After the Spanish arrested José Rizal in July 1892, Bonifacio became convinced that the Philippines would only achieve independence through revolution rather than peaceful reform.[^17] On July 7, 1892, Bonifacio, together with Deodato Arellano, Ladislao Diwa, Teodoro Plata, and Valentín Díaz, founded the Katipunan—in full, Kataas-taasang, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (Supreme and Venerable Society of the Children of the Nation) in Manila.[^18]

The Katipunan was modeled after Freemasonry, with elaborate rituals, secret signs, and a hierarchical structure that Bonifacio carefully designed.[^19] The organization advocated independence through armed revolt against Spain and was open to both peasants and the middle class, making it uniquely egalitarian for its time.[^20] Bonifacio served as the Kataastaasang Pangulo (Supreme President) of the Katipunan, providing both organizational and ideological leadership to the growing movement.[^21]

The Katipunan grew rapidly through Bonifacio's tireless recruitment efforts and organizational skills. By 1896, the society had expanded to over 30,000 members and functioned at the national, provincial, and municipal levels throughout the Tagalog regions.[^22] Bonifacio contributed to the movement not only as an organizer but also as a writer and propagandist. He wrote "Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa" (Love for One's Homeland), a poem published in the first issue of Kalayaan, the Katipunan's newspaper, in March 1896 under the pseudonym "A.I.B" (Agapito Bagumbayan).[^23] The poem, composed of twelve stanzas, exhorted Filipinos to join the crusade for independence and expressed willingness to sacrifice everything for the nation.[^24]

The discovery of the Katipunan came through betrayal. Teodoro Patiño, a Katipunan member known for his talkativeness, revealed the existence of the revolutionary organization to Spanish priest Mariano Gil, who reported it to local authorities.[^25] With the Spanish authorities closing in, Bonifacio made the momentous decision to launch the revolution immediately. In late August 1896, Bonifacio led members of the Katipunan in an act of defiance somewhere around Caloocan, which included parts of present-day Quezon City.[^26] This event, known as the "Cry of Pugad Lawin" or "Cry of Balintawak" (the exact location remains disputed among historians), involved the tearing of community tax certificates (cédulas personales) by the rebels to mark their separation from Spain.[^27] After Bonifacio's intense and convincing speech, the Katipuneros destroyed their cedulas and together raised the cry of "Revolt".[^28]

## Major Achievements

Bonifacio's greatest achievement was founding the Katipunan and transforming it from a small secret society into a mass revolutionary movement that successfully challenged three centuries of Spanish colonial rule. The organizational structure he created proved resilient and effective, allowing the movement to survive despite Spanish crackdowns and continue operating across multiple provinces.[^29]

As a military leader, Bonifacio personally led several campaigns against Spanish forces. On August 30, 1896, he led an attack on San Juan del Monte (now San Juan) attempting to capture the town's powder magazine and water station that supplied Manila.[^30] Although this battle ultimately failed, it demonstrated Bonifacio's willingness to lead from the front and his strategic understanding that controlling Manila's water supply could force Spanish capitulation.[^31]

Bonifacio envisioned an ambitious three-pronged attack on Manila designed to bring the Walled City under revolutionary control. According to his plan, General Aguedo del Rosario would attack from Tondo, General Vicente Fernandez via San Marcelino, and General Ramon Bernardo through the Rotonda in Sampaloc.[^32] General Fernandez was supposed to take over La Electricista de Manila (the Manila electric plant) in Quiapo and cut electrical supply to Manila, which would serve as the signal for coordinated attacks.[^33] The plan showed sophisticated strategic thinking, recognizing that darkness would neutralize Spanish advantages and create chaos in enemy ranks.

Although the Battle of Manila failed when General Fernandez could not launch the signal from the electric plant, Bonifacio's campaigns succeeded in sparking a nationwide uprising.[^34] This revolt in Manila, though lasting only a week before Bonifacio and his men were reduced to guerrilla warfare, led to the arrests and executions of thousands of upper-class Filipinos suspected of having Katipunan ties.[^35] Bonifacio had sparked an uprising bigger than any previous revolt in the Tagalog-Pampango provinces.[^36]

Bonifacio's military innovation included adapting traditional Filipino warfare methods. He adopted a consultative approach to warfare derived from a preconquest leadership style, in contrast to Aguinaldo's centralized, hierarchical military approach.[^37] He established networks of camps called "reales" in the mountains and forests where his forces could retreat after battles, ensuring that even when defeated in battles such as Pinaglabanan, the Katipuneros were not wiped out completely.[^38] Despite being poorly armed, the Katipunan under Bonifacio employed guerrilla tactics and relied on mass popular support.[^39]

As a writer and intellectual, Bonifacio made significant contributions to revolutionary propaganda. His poem "Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa" became an anthem of the revolution, directly inspiring Filipinos to prioritize love of country above all else.[^40] The poem's opening rhetorical question—"Aling pag-ibig pa ang hihigit kaya sa pagkadalisay at pagkadakila, gaya ng pag-ibig sa tinubuang lupa?" (What love can be purer and greater than the love of one's country?)—resonated deeply with Filipinos seeking to articulate their nationalist aspirations.[^41]

Bonifacio's leadership demonstrated genuine concern for ordinary Filipinos. His egalitarian vision welcomed members from all social classes into the Katipunan, contrasting sharply with the elite-dominated reform movements of the era.[^42] He understood that revolution required mass participation and worked tirelessly to recruit from the working class, peasantry, and urban poor.[^43] This populist approach gave the revolution genuine grassroots support that sustained it even after his death.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his heroic status, Bonifacio's leadership faced significant criticisms, particularly regarding his military effectiveness. As the Spanish systematically routed the insurrectos, it became increasingly clear that Bonifacio was an ineffective military leader compared to the Cavite generals who won battles in their province during the onset of the revolution.[^44] His forces were repeatedly defeated by better-trained and better-equipped Spanish troops, forcing him to retreat to Montalban in the north.[^45]

The most controversial episode of Bonifacio's life centered on the Tejeros Convention held on March 22, 1897, in San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias), Cavite.[^46] Bonifacio was invited by Cavite leaders ostensibly to mediate the rivalry between two provincial chapters of the Katipunan—the Magdalo and Magdiwang factions.[^47] However, the meeting shifted focus from defense strategy to an election aimed at deciding the leadership of the revolutionary movement.[^48]

During the election, Emilio Aguinaldo was chosen as president while Bonifacio came in second.[^49] However, Bonifacio's wife Gregoria de Jesus and witness Santiago Alvarez declared in writing that the election was rigged, with ballots already filled up before distribution.[^50] The humiliation deepened when Daniel Tirona questioned Bonifacio's qualifications after he was elected Director of the Interior, suggesting that a lawyer would be better suited for the position.[^51] Enraged, Bonifacio declared all matters convened in the Tejeros Convention null and void.[^52]

Written one day after the events at Tejeros, Bonifacio drafted the "Acta de Tejeros," which historians view as his outraged yet calculated move against Aguinaldo's capturing of the Katipunan.[^53] This document rejected the convention's legitimacy and attempted to establish his own rebel government, actions that would later be used against him in charges of sedition and treason.[^54]

The political rivalry between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo is often interpreted as a classic class struggle between the elite and the masses. Aguinaldo, whose family belonged to the Cavite "principalia," represented the upper class, while Bonifacio, whose father was a tailor and mother a factory supervisor, belonged to the lower middle class.[^55] This class dimension added social tension to what was already a dangerous political rivalry within the revolutionary movement.

Historians have condemned Bonifacio's subsequent trial as a travesty of justice. The jury was entirely composed of Aguinaldo's men, Bonifacio's defense lawyer acted more like a prosecutor by declaring Bonifacio's guilt while merely appealing for less punishment, and Bonifacio was not allowed to confront the state witness for conspiracy charges on grounds that the witness had been killed in battle—though the witness was later seen with prosecutors.[^56] Bonifacio and his brother Procopio stood trial on May 5, 1897, in Maragondon, Cavite, on charges of sedition and treason against Aguinaldo's government and conspiracy to murder Aguinaldo.[^57]

Both brothers were found guilty and sentenced to death. Emilio Aguinaldo initially commuted the death sentence to banishment but was later influenced by generals around him to withdraw the commutation.[^58] The execution of Andrés and Procopio Bonifacio on May 10, 1897, in the mountains of Maragondon remains one of the most divisive episodes in Philippine revolutionary history.[^59] Controversial issues surrounding his death include the legality of the court martial and sentence, the precise role of Aguinaldo in approving the death sentence, and whether Bonifacio was shot or hacked to death.[^60]

## Personal Life

Bonifacio's personal life was marked by deep romantic commitment and partnership in revolutionary struggle. When he was in his late twenties, Bonifacio fell in love with Gregoria Alvarez de Jesús, known by her nickname Oriang, who was only 18 years old at the time.[^61] Gregoria was born on May 9, 1875, in Caloocan to a middle-class, pious Roman Catholic family, with her father Nicolás de Jesús working as a carpenter who later served as gobernadorcillo.[^62]

Bonifacio revealed his intentions to marry Gregoria to her parents, but her father initially disapproved because Bonifacio was a Freemason.[^63] Undeterred, Bonifacio continued his courtship for almost six months until Gregoria fell in love with him.[^64] The couple married in a Catholic ceremony at Binondo Church in March 1893 or 1894, respecting her parents' religious beliefs.[^65] Later that same day, they participated in separate Katipunan rites at a friend's house in Santa Cruz, Manila, reflecting their dual commitment to Catholic tradition and revolutionary ideals.[^66]

A year after their marriage, Gregoria returned to her family's house because she was pregnant.[^67] She gave birth to their only son, whom she christened Andrés after her husband.[^68] Tragically, their infant son died of smallpox just a few months later, a devastating loss for the young couple.[^69]

Gregoria was far more than Bonifacio's wife; she was his revolutionary partner. She acted as secretary of the women's section and served as custodian of the documents and seal of the Katipunan, positions of significant trust and responsibility within the organization.[^70] Her involvement demonstrated that the revolutionary movement included women in meaningful leadership roles, and her later designation as "Lakambini of the Katipunan" recognized her contributions.[^71]

After Bonifacio's execution, Gregoria's life took another tragic turn when she was raped by Spanish forces following her husband's death.[^72] Julio Nakpil, a commander of the Katipunan forces in northern Philippines who remained loyal to Bonifacio, took care of the widowed Gregoria.[^73] The two fell in love and married at Quiapo Church in Manila on December 10, 1898.[^74] Gregoria later confirmed in her autobiography written on November 5, 1928, that "the (Balintawak) uprising began with the cry for liberty on 26 August 1896," providing crucial historical testimony about the revolution.[^75]

Bonifacio's personality combined passionate nationalism with genuine humility. Despite leading a revolutionary movement, he maintained connections to his working-class roots and never affected aristocratic airs. His self-education and intellectual curiosity impressed contemporaries, as did his ability to articulate nationalist aspirations in both Tagalog poetry and organizational documents. His famous quote, "Ibigin mo ang iyóng bayan nang sunód kay Bathalà, sa iyóng kapurihan, at higít sa lahat sa iyong sarili" (Love your country next to God, your honor, and most of all yourself), revealed his philosophical approach that placed patriotism among the highest virtues.[^76]

## Legacy

Andrés Bonifacio's legacy remains powerful and contested in Philippine national consciousness. He is officially called "The Father of the Philippine Revolution" and considered a national hero of the Philippines.[^77] Besides José Rizal, Bonifacio is the only other Filipino given implied recognition as a national hero based on the Philippine government's policy on national holidays—only Rizal and Bonifacio are commemorated in full or "regular" national holidays.[^78] The Philippine Legislature enacted Act No. 2946, which made November 30 of each year a legal holiday to commemorate Bonifacio's birth, henceforth called Bonifacio Day.[^79]

Bonifacio remains a powerful symbol of Filipino courage, patriotism, and the common man's role in shaping national destiny.[^80] His humble origins and connection to the masses made him an icon for ordinary Filipinos, demonstrating that heroism and leadership could emerge from any social class.[^81] He embodied the aspirations of the Anak ng Bayan (Children of the Nation), the very phrase he used to name the Katipunan.[^82]

The historical debate over whether Bonifacio should share or even replace José Rizal as the foremost Philippine national hero continues among scholars and the public. Some historians consider Bonifacio to be the rightful first President of the Philippines instead of Aguinaldo, given that he led the revolutionary government before the Tejeros Convention.[^83] However, prominent historians offer nuanced perspectives on this debate.

Historian Ambeth Ocampo argues that debating Bonifacio as the "better" hero on grounds that he, not Rizal, began the Philippine Revolution is moot since Rizal inspired Bonifacio, the Katipunan, and the Revolution itself.[^84] Teodoro Agoncillo suggests that Bonifacio should not replace Rizal as national hero, but they should be honored "side by side," recognizing their complementary contributions to Philippine independence.[^85]

Despite the lack of any official declaration explicitly proclaiming them as national heroes, Rizal and Bonifacio remain admired and revered for their roles in Philippine history.[^86] The National Historical Commission of the Philippines has emphasized that Bonifacio was "more than a revolutionary," recognizing his contributions as a writer, organizer, and symbol of Filipino nationalism.[^87]

Bonifacio's death has spawned its own contested legacy. His execution is alternately viewed as a justified punishment for treason and as a "legal murder" fueled by politics and class rivalry.[^88] The circumstances of his death—arrested by fellow revolutionaries, tried in a biased court, and executed by order of Aguinaldo's government—raise uncomfortable questions about internal divisions and betrayal within the independence movement.[^89] These questions remain relevant to contemporary Philippine politics, where issues of justice, legitimacy, and class continue to divide the nation.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholars emphasizing Bonifacio's contributions view him as the genuine revolutionary who transformed nationalist sentiment into concrete action. While Rizal advocated reform through writing and peaceful means, Bonifacio recognized that Spanish colonialism would only end through armed revolution.[^90] His founding of the Katipunan demonstrated organizational genius, creating a secret society that survived Spanish surveillance and grew into a mass movement encompassing tens of thousands of members.[^91]

Bonifacio's egalitarian vision distinguished him from elite-dominated movements. By opening the Katipunan to all social classes and actively recruiting from peasants, workers, and the urban poor, he created a genuinely populist revolution rather than an elite power grab.[^92] This inclusive approach meant the revolution had deep roots in Philippine society and could survive leadership changes and military setbacks.

Progressive historians celebrate Bonifacio as a proletarian hero who represented the aspirations of the masses against both colonial oppression and local elite domination.[^93] His humble origins, self-education, and lifelong connection to working people make him an authentic representative of the Filipino majority. Unlike revolutionary leaders who came from privileged backgrounds, Bonifacio experienced firsthand the poverty and limited opportunities that Spanish colonialism imposed on ordinary Filipinos.

Bonifacio's writings, particularly "Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa," are recognized as significant contributions to Philippine nationalist literature. Despite limited formal education, he articulated a philosophy of patriotism that inspired generations of Filipinos to prioritize national liberation over personal advancement.[^94] His poetry demonstrated that nationalist thought could be expressed in Tagalog rather than Spanish or English, affirming the validity of indigenous languages for serious political and philosophical discourse.

The National Historical Commission of the Philippines has emphasized that Bonifacio was "more than a revolutionary," acknowledging his multifaceted contributions as organizer, writer, and symbol.[^95] His courage in starting the revolution despite knowing the risks, his willingness to fight alongside ordinary soldiers rather than command from a distance, and his ultimate sacrifice for the cause he believed in exemplify heroic dedication to national independence.

### Negative Views

Critics of Bonifacio, both contemporary and historical, focus primarily on his military ineffectiveness and the political instability his leadership created. As the Spanish systematically defeated his forces, it became clear that Bonifacio lacked the military training and strategic sophistication needed to win battles against professional Spanish troops.[^96] Compared to the Cavite generals under Aguinaldo who achieved victories in their province, Bonifacio's campaigns in Manila and surrounding areas resulted in repeated defeats and retreats.[^97]

Bonifacio's rejection of the Tejeros Convention results, while emotionally understandable, represented political immaturity and threatened to split the revolutionary movement at a critical moment when unity was essential against Spanish forces.[^98] By attempting to establish a rival government and refusing to accept democratic election results (however flawed the process), Bonifacio created internal division that weakened the revolution.[^99] Some historians argue that Aguinaldo had legitimate reasons to view Bonifacio as a threat to revolutionary unity and effectiveness.

Glenn Anthony May's scholarly work "Inventing a Hero: The Posthumous Re-creation of Andres Bonifacio" (1996) questions how much of Bonifacio's heroic image reflects historical reality versus posthumous mythmaking designed to create a populist icon.[^100] May's research suggests that some aspects of the Bonifacio legend were constructed or exaggerated by later historians and political movements seeking a revolutionary hero who represented the masses.

Critics note that Bonifacio's leadership style, while consultative and inclusive, may have been poorly suited to military command, which requires quick decisions and clear hierarchies.[^101] His insistence on consensus and consultation, admirable in organizational contexts, may have contributed to tactical failures and missed opportunities in military campaigns where decisive action was crucial.

The circumstances surrounding Bonifacio's death, while tragic, resulted partly from his own political choices after Tejeros. By refusing to accept the convention results, drafting the Acta de Tejeros, and attempting to establish a rival government, Bonifacio created a situation where Aguinaldo's government could legitimately view him as a threat to revolutionary unity.[^102] While the trial was clearly unjust and politically motivated, Bonifacio's post-Tejeros actions provided the pretext for charges of sedition and treason.

Some historians note that Bonifacio's famous writings, including "Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa," directly copied passages from José Rizal's essay "Love of Country," raising questions about originality.[^103] Specifically, the first, sixth, seventh, and eighth stanzas discussing the purity and greatness of love for one's native land were taken from Rizal's work, suggesting Bonifacio was more of a popularizer than an original thinker.
