## Summary

Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet, built one of the world's largest media empires from a single radio station in northern Ontario. He acquired The Scotsman newspaper, The Times of London, and hundreds of newspapers across North America and Britain. He famously called television a 'license to print money.' His empire eventually became Thomson Reuters, the world's largest news and information provider.
