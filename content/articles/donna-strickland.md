## Summary

Donna Strickland is a Canadian optical physicist who shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics for her development of chirped pulse amplification with Gérard Mourou. She was only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. Their technique for generating high-intensity ultrashort optical pulses revolutionized laser physics and enabled applications in medicine, industry, and science. Notably, she did not have a Wikipedia page until her Nobel Prize was announced.
