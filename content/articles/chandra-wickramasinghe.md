## Summary

Chandra Wickramasinghe, with Fred Hoyle, proposed that interstellar dust contains organic molecules and developed the theory of panspermia — that life on Earth was seeded by comets and meteorites carrying microorganisms from space. He identified organic polymers in interstellar dust using infrared spectroscopy. His controversial theories challenged conventional views of life's origins.
