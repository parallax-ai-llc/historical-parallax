## Summary

Patriarch Athenagoras I was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1948 to 1972. He was a pioneer of Christian ecumenism, meeting with Pope Paul VI in Jerusalem in 1964, the first such meeting in 500 years. Together they issued a joint declaration lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054 between Rome and Constantinople. His efforts toward Christian unity were groundbreaking for Orthodox-Catholic relations.
