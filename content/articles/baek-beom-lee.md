## Summary

Kim Gu (김구; 金九), also known by his pen name Baekbeom (백범; 白凡, meaning "Ordinary Man"), was one of Korea's most revered independence activists and statesmen.[^1] Born on August 29, 1876, in Hwanghae Province, he dedicated his entire life to Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule and the reunification of the Korean Peninsula.[^2] Kim served as the sixth, ninth, and last President of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea from 1940 to 1945, leading the Korean independence movement from exile in China for over two decades.[^3] He was assassinated on June 26, 1949, by Army Lieutenant Ahn Doo-hee, becoming a martyr for his vision of a unified, independent Korea.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Kim Gu was born Kim Ch'angam on August 29, 1876, in T'otkol village, Paegunbang, Haeju, Hwanghae Province, during the late Joseon Dynasty.[^5] He was the only child of farmers Kim Sunyŏng and Kwak Nagwŏn, a family that had fallen from yangban (noble) status after their ancestor Kim Chajŏm lost favor in 1651.[^6] Despite their impoverished circumstances and low social standing, Kim's parents placed tremendous emphasis on his education, viewing it as the only path to escape poverty.[^7]

At age two, Kim suffered from smallpox, which left permanent scars on his face—marks he would carry throughout his life.[^8] When he was approximately nine years old, his family relocated to provide him access to a local seodang (traditional Korean school) to prepare for the gwageo civil service examinations.[^9] There, he studied Chinese classical texts including the Zizhi Tongjian and the Great Learning, receiving a traditional Confucian education that would shape his intellectual foundation.[^10]

Kim's early political awakening came through his involvement in the Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894, a large-scale uprising against feudal injustice and foreign interference.[^11] On December 2, 1894, Kim and his rebel forces attempted to reoccupy Haeju, attacking Japanese scouts at 6:00 am in a battle that continued until 8:00 am when the rebels were forced to retreat.[^12] This experience exposed the young Kim to both the aspirations for Korean sovereignty and the brutal reality of Japanese military power.[^13]

Following the revolution's suppression, Kim's life took a dramatic turn when he learned of the brutal assassination of Queen Min (Empress Myeongseong) on October 8, 1895, by Japanese agents under Miura Gorō.[^14] In an act of revenge and patriotic fury, Kim killed a Japanese man he believed was connected to the queen's murder in 1896, though the victim was not actually one of the assassins.[^15] For this act, Kim was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but he managed to escape in 1898.[^16]

While on the run, Kim briefly became a Buddhist monk at Magoksa temple in Chungcheong Province, taking the monastic name Wŏnjong (원종; 圓宗).[^17] However, as he did not genuinely embrace Buddhism or the monastic lifestyle, he left the temple in spring 1899, reuniting with his parents after requesting to study at Geumgang Mountain but instead slipping away from his fellow monks.[^18]

## Rise to Power

Kim Gu's transformation from a fugitive revolutionary to a prominent independence leader occurred through several pivotal stages during the early 20th century. In 1905, he converted to Christianity, which opened new opportunities for education and leadership.[^19] After leaving the Buddhist priesthood, Kim returned to Hwanghae Province, where he devoted himself to enlightenment and education, founding Jangyeon School and Yangsan School in 1907 and serving as principal of Yangsan School.[^20]

In 1908, Kim joined the New People's Association (Sinminhoe), a clandestine national-level organization established by Ahn Changho dedicated to fostering Korean independence through education and modernization rather than violence.[^21] The association believed that citizens needed to become "new people" (신민, 新民) prepared for independence through enlightenment and education.[^22] They made massive investments in education throughout Korea and established the Military School of the New Rising, which later contributed to the formation of various Korean independence armies between 1911 and 1920.[^23]

Kim's rising prominence made him a target of Japanese authorities. In 1911, he was arrested in connection with the 105 Persons Incident, a fabricated conspiracy alleging Korean attempts to assassinate Governor-General Terauchi Masatake.[^24] Over 700 Koreans were arrested, many of them Christians and members of the New People's Association.[^25] Kim was sentenced to 15 years in prison, though he was released after three years when no evidence could be found linking him to any assassination plot.[^26] The imprisonment was brutal—Kim was severely tortured, suffering permanent damage to his ear cartilage and disfigurement of his left ear from beatings by Japanese guards.[^27] This experience deepened his commitment to Korean independence and his hatred of Japanese colonial oppression.

The March First Movement of 1919 proved to be the catalyst for Kim's emergence as a national leader. On March 1, 1919, twenty-nine Korean leaders gathered in Seoul and read aloud a declaration of Korean independence, sparking nationwide protests involving over one million people.[^28] Though the peaceful demonstrations were brutally suppressed by Japanese forces, the movement laid the foundation for organized resistance.[^29] Kim Gu fled to Shanghai, China, in 1919, joining other Korean patriots who had established the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in April of that year.[^30]

In Shanghai, Kim became one of the founding members of the Provisional Government, initially serving in various capacities including chief of security and minister of home affairs.[^31] After the death of Yi Tongnyŏng in March 1940, Kim was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee on May 11, 1940, and in September, he was reelected as head of government, becoming Chairperson of the State Affairs Commission.[^32] Kim would serve as President of the Provisional Government from 1926 to 1927 and again from 1940 to 1945, becoming the government's most enduring leader.[^33]

## Major Achievements

Kim Gu's most significant achievement was founding and leading the Korean Patriotic Organization (KPO) in 1931, dedicated to direct action against Japanese imperial and colonial targets.[^34] The organization conducted several high-profile operations that captured international attention and demonstrated Korean resistance to Japanese occupation. On January 8, 1932, KPO member Lee Bong-chang attempted to assassinate Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo by throwing a grenade at the Emperor's carriage, though the attempt failed and Lee was later executed.[^35]

The KPO's most successful operation came on April 29, 1932, when member Yun Bong-gil detonated a bomb at a celebration in Shanghai's Hongkou Park, killing government minister Kawabata Teiji and mortally wounding General Yoshinori Shirakawa, who died from his injuries on May 26, 1932.[^36] Kim publicly claimed personal responsibility for organizing these operations to protect other Koreans from retaliation, resulting in combined Japanese bounties on his head worth 60,000 Dayang—an enormous sum for that era.[^37]

These assassination campaigns, while controversial, achieved their strategic objective of keeping Korean independence on the international agenda and forcing the Japanese to divert resources to security. The Hongkou Park bombing particularly impressed Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who remarked that Korean resistance accomplished more in one day than Chinese armies had in months.[^38]

Kim's relationship with Chiang Kai-shek proved crucial for the independence movement's survival. In July 1932, Kim requested a meeting with Chiang to secure support for training Korean fighters.[^39] When they met in September 1932, Kim asked for substantial funding to conduct operations in Korea and Manchuria, and after negotiations, Chiang agreed to provide monthly payments and hide Kim from Japanese authorities.[^40] Chiang also allowed Kim to train Korean resistance fighters at a military academy in Nanjing, providing the provisional government with its first formal military capability.[^41]

On April 11, 1940, Chiang Kai-shek approved Kim's proposal to establish a Korean Provisional Government army, though disagreements arose regarding command structure—Chiang wanted the army subordinate to Kuomintang forces while Kim sought greater independence.[^42] Despite the Kuomintang initially pulling funding, Kim proceeded with establishing the Korean Liberation Army (KLA), which was formally announced on September 17, 1940, at the Jialing Hotel in Chongqing at 6:00 am to avoid Japanese air raids.[^43] General Chi Ch'ŏngch'ŏn was appointed commander, with General Lee Beom-seok as chief of staff.[^44] The KLA would serve as the armed forces of the Provisional Government, representing Korean sovereignty and the nation's commitment to military resistance.

Kim's literary legacy also constitutes a major achievement. He authored the Baekbeom Ilji (백범일지; White Beom's Diary), his autobiography written in two volumes—the first completed in 1929 and the second around 1942.[^45] This work became an essential historical document for understanding the Korean independence movement and was designated Cultural Treasure No. 1245 by the Korean government on June 12, 1997.[^46] The autobiography became a bestseller in Korea and has been translated into multiple languages, preserving Kim's vision and experiences for future generations.[^47]

Kim's most famous statement from his autobiography captured his unwavering dedication: "If God asked me what was my wish, I would reply unhesitatingly, 'Korean independence.' If he asked me what was my second wish, I would again answer, 'My country's independence.' If he asked me what was my third wish, I would reply in an even louder voice, 'My wish is the complete independence of my country, Korea.'"[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revered status, Kim Gu's methods and political positions generated significant controversy both during his lifetime and in historical assessment. His leadership of the Korean Patriotic Organization's assassination campaigns, while celebrated by independence supporters, raised ethical questions about targeting individuals and the use of violence as a political tool.[^49] The failed attempt on Emperor Hirohito's life and the successful bombing at Hongkou Park, while strategically effective, resulted in civilian casualties and invited brutal Japanese retaliation against Korean communities.[^50]

Kim's personal life also contained controversial elements. After his wife Choi Jun-rye died on January 1, 1924, Kim was unable to visit her in the hospital before her death because he was a wanted man.[^51] While hiding in China, local supporters suggested he marry a Chinese woman to better blend in, and he chose Zhu Aibao, a 20-year-old boat owner.[^52] They lived together on her boat for about five years but never officially married, and Kim eventually provided her only 100 yuan to return to Jiaxing, never seeing her again.[^53] This relationship, while practical for his survival, raised questions about his treatment of women and personal responsibilities.

Kim's approach to family also drew criticism. After his wife's death, he temporarily placed his younger son Shin in an orphanage because he could not care for him while conducting independence activities.[^54] In November 1925, his mother and son Shin returned to Korea to avoid interfering with Kim's work, and in September 1927, his eldest son In also returned to Korea.[^55] While these decisions were understandable given the circumstances of exile and revolutionary work, they reflected the personal costs of his single-minded devotion to the independence cause.

The most controversial aspect of Kim's later career was his opposition to the establishment of a separate South Korean government and his willingness to negotiate with communist North Korea. In April 1948, Kim traveled to Pyongyang to participate in the North and South Korean Leaders' Conference, meeting directly with Kim Il-sung to pursue unification talks.[^56] He strongly opposed the UN decision to establish a Korean government only in the South and defied Syngman Rhee and the United States by making this trip.[^57]

Kim's collaboration with northern leaders generated intense criticism in the South. While Kim did not consider himself a communist and stated he wanted "to see the actual things happening in North Korea" rather than support the North Korean People's Committee's policies, his willingness to engage with communists was seen by many as dangerous naivety at best and treason at worst.[^58] The conference failed to achieve unification, and Kim reportedly left Pyongyang with a worse view of the North than before, convinced that if the Soviet Union wanted war, they would achieve total victory quickly.[^59]

Kim's legacy remained controversial even decades after his death. When his portrait was considered for the 100,000 won bill in 2007, the bill was never printed due to lingering hatred of Kim as "an appeaser of communism" when a new administration took office in 2009.[^60] This demonstrates how Cold War politics and South Korea's anti-communist ideology continued to complicate assessments of Kim's contributions to Korean independence.

## Personal Life

Kim Gu married Choi Jun-rye (also spelled Chun-rye), who bore him five children—three daughters and two sons.[^61] Tragically, all three daughters died young, and only his two sons survived to adulthood: Kim In (1917-1945) and Kim Shin.[^62] Kim In joined his father in Shanghai in 1920 at age three, experiencing the hardships of exile from a young age.[^63] The family separation caused by Kim's revolutionary activities created deep personal anguish; when Choi Jun-rye died on January 1, 1924, just two years after giving birth to their fifth child, Kim was unable to be at her bedside because he was a wanted fugitive.[^64]

Kim's relationship with Zhu Aibao, the Chinese boat owner he lived with for approximately five years while in hiding, revealed both his pragmatism and his capacity for human connection under extraordinary circumstances.[^65] Though they never formally married and eventually parted ways, this relationship provided Kim with crucial cover and companionship during a dangerous period of his exile.[^66]

Those who knew Kim described him as a man of intense conviction and personal austerity. His choice of the pen name "Baekbeom" (Ordinary Man) reflected his philosophy that every ordinary Korean person should fight for independence, positioning himself as representative of the common people rather than an elite leader.[^67] While imprisoned, Kim changed his name from Kim Changsoo to Kim Koo, symbolically breaking free from Japanese nationality records and reinventing his identity around the independence struggle.[^68]

Kim's physical appearance bore the marks of his life's struggles. The smallpox scars from his childhood, combined with facial scarring and his disfigured left ear from torture during the 105 Persons Incident, gave him a weathered appearance that testified to decades of hardship.[^69] Despite these physical marks and the personal tragedies he endured—the loss of his daughters, his wife, and later his eldest son In, who died in 1945—Kim maintained an unwavering focus on Korean independence and reunification.

Kim's personality combined fiery passion with strategic thinking. His willingness to personally assume responsibility for the KPO's assassination operations demonstrated both courage and tactical acumen, protecting other members of the organization while maintaining operational security.[^70] His famous quote about wishing for Korean independence three times reflected not rhetorical excess but genuine single-minded devotion to a cause he had pursued since his youth.[^71]

## Legacy

Kim Gu's legacy in Korea is profound and multifaceted, though complicated by the division of the Korean Peninsula and the politics of memory. In 1962, the South Korean government under Park Chung Hee posthumously awarded Kim the Republic of Korea Medal of Order of Merit for National Foundation, the nation's most prestigious civil decoration.[^72] This was part of a larger recognition in which 204 independence activists received belated honors on March 1, 1962, correcting President Syngman Rhee's failure to properly recognize many who had fought for independence.[^73]

The Kim Koo Museum, located in Hyochang Park in Seoul's Yongsan District, opened on October 22, 2002, to commemorate his life and preserve his legacy.[^74] The museum includes a library and serves as the primary memorial dedicated to Kim's contributions to Korean independence.[^75] Additionally, Baekbeom-ro street in Seoul and Baekbeom Square Park atop Namsan Mountain are named in his honor, ensuring his memory remains part of Seoul's urban landscape.[^76]

Remarkably, Kim Gu is one of the few Korean historical figures honored by both North and South Korea. South Korea awarded him the Order of Merit for National Foundation, while North Korea posthumously granted him the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's National Reunification Prize, recognizing his efforts to prevent the peninsula's division.[^77] This dual recognition reflects Kim's unique position as a nationalist who prioritized Korean unity over ideological divisions—a stance that made him controversial during his lifetime but prescient in retrospect.

Kim's autobiography, Baekbeom Ilji, continues to be widely read in Korea and has been translated into multiple languages, serving as both a historical document and a source of national inspiration.[^78] The work provides invaluable firsthand accounts of the independence movement and articulates a vision of Korean sovereignty that transcends the division that ultimately occurred.[^79] Its designation as Cultural Treasure No. 1245 ensures its preservation and study by future generations.[^80]

However, Kim's legacy remains contested in South Korean politics and society. The abandonment of plans to feature his portrait on the 100,000 won bill in 2009 due to perceptions of him as "an appeaser of communism" demonstrates how Cold War ideology continues to shape historical memory.[^81] Conservative critics view his 1948 Pyongyang trip and willingness to negotiate with Kim Il-sung as dangerous naivety that could have undermined South Korea's establishment, while progressives celebrate his commitment to peaceful reunification and his resistance to permanent division.[^82]

Kim's assassination in 1949 by Ahn Doo-hee, who was convicted but served only one year before being released at the outbreak of the Korean War, remains a source of controversy and conspiracy theories.[^83] Declassified 2001 U.S. military documents revealed that Ahn had been an informant and agent for the U.S. Counter-Intelligence Corps, leading to speculation about possible American or South Korean government involvement in the assassination.[^84] Ahn lived freely for decades until he was killed in 1996 by Park Ki-seo, a bus driver and Kim Gu admirer, using a wooden club inscribed with the words "Justice Stick."[^85] Park received only three years in prison for the murder "on the grounds that the motive for the crime was public anger," serving less than one year before release—a sentence that reflected continued public sympathy for Kim Gu nearly fifty years after his death.[^86]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters of Kim Gu emphasize his unwavering dedication to Korean independence and his unique position as a nationalist leader who transcended ideological divisions. Historians note that Kim's commitment to Korean sovereignty predated the Cold War divisions that would ultimately define the peninsula, making him one of the last representatives of a unified Korean nationalist tradition.[^87] His leadership of the Provisional Government through its most difficult years—maintaining Korean resistance from exile despite limited resources and constant Japanese pressure—demonstrated remarkable resilience and organizational capability.[^88]

Admirers particularly celebrate Kim's vision of Korean reunification and his willingness to risk his reputation and safety to pursue unity talks in 1948.[^89] In retrospect, his warnings about permanent division and his efforts to prevent the establishment of separate governments appear prophetic, as the Korean War erupted just one year after his assassination, solidifying the division he had struggled to prevent.[^90] Progressive historians view Kim as representing a "third way" between right-wing authoritarianism and communist totalitarianism, seeking a unified, democratic Korea that ultimately was not allowed to emerge.[^91]

Kim's educational initiatives and his work with the New People's Association receive scholarly praise for recognizing that independence required not just military resistance but cultural and intellectual preparation.[^92] His establishment of schools and emphasis on enlightenment demonstrated a sophisticated understanding that sustainable independence required an educated citizenry capable of self-governance.[^93]

The Korean Liberation Army's establishment under Kim's leadership, despite minimal resources and political obstacles, showed his ability to create institutions that symbolized Korean sovereignty even in exile.[^94] Though the KLA never conducted major military operations before Japan's surrender, its existence provided a framework for Korean military traditions and a symbol of national armed resistance.[^95]

International scholars note that Kim's assassination campaigns, while controversial, effectively kept Korean independence on the international agenda during a period when the issue might otherwise have been forgotten.[^96] The Hongkou Park bombing particularly impressed observers worldwide and demonstrated that Korean resistance remained active and capable despite Japanese occupation.[^97]

### Negative Views

Critics and detractors of Kim Gu focus on several aspects of his leadership and decision-making. Conservative historians argue that his willingness to negotiate with communists in 1948 demonstrated dangerous political naivety that could have resulted in a communist takeover of the entire peninsula rather than the preservation of a free South Korea.[^98] They contend that Syngman Rhee's realism about the impossibility of reunification under existing circumstances, while less idealistic, was more responsible given Cold War realities.[^99]

Some scholars criticize Kim's assassination campaigns as counterproductive, arguing that they invited brutal Japanese retaliation against Korean communities while achieving limited strategic results.[^100] The failed Hirohito assassination and the Hongkou Park bombing, critics argue, may have stiffened Japanese resolve and provided justification for harsher colonial policies without significantly advancing the independence cause.[^101]

Kim's autocratic leadership style within the Provisional Government has also drawn criticism. His long tenure as president and his consolidation of power within the exile government sometimes marginalized other voices and approaches to the independence struggle.[^102] Rivalries between Kim and other independence leaders, including Syngman Rhee, occasionally hindered unified action and consumed energy that might have been directed against Japanese occupation.[^103]

His personal relationships, particularly his treatment of family members and his relationship with Zhu Aibao, reveal aspects of Kim's character that complicate the heroic narrative.[^104] The placement of his son in an orphanage and his separation from his family, while understandable given his circumstances, demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice personal relationships entirely to political goals.[^105]

Some historians question whether Kim's emphasis on symbolic resistance through assassination campaigns represented the most effective use of limited resources, suggesting that other approaches—such as building stronger organizational networks inside Korea or developing more sophisticated intelligence capabilities—might have contributed more substantially to eventual liberation.[^106] The reality that Korea's independence came primarily through Japan's defeat by Allied powers rather than through resistance efforts raises questions about the strategic effectiveness of Kim's chosen methods.[^107]

Finally, Kim's failure to achieve his primary goal of preventing Korean division, despite his best efforts, reflects either the impossibility of that task given Cold War realities or his inability to navigate the complex international politics of the post-1945 period effectively.[^108] His assassination before the Korean War prevented him from either proving his approach correct or adapting to the new realities of a divided peninsula.[^109]
