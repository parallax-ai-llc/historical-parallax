## Summary

George Porter was a British chemist who shared the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for studies of extremely fast chemical reactions effected by disturbing the equilibrium by means of very short pulses of energy (flash photolysis). His technique of flash photolysis allowed observation of chemical reactions occurring in millionths of a second. He later served as president of the Royal Society and director of the Royal Institution.
