## Summary

Tsongkhapa was a Tibetan Buddhist philosopher and reformer who founded the Gelug (Yellow Hat) school, which became the dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism. His magnum opus Lamrim Chenmo (Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment) is one of the most comprehensive guides to Buddhist practice. He emphasized strict monastic discipline, rigorous philosophical study, and ethical conduct. The Dalai Lamas belong to his Gelug lineage.
