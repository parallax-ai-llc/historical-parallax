## Overview

On May 29, 1953, two men stood on top of the world. New Zealander **Edmund Hillary** and Nepali Sherpa **Tenzing Norgay** completed the first successful ascent of Mount Everest (8,848m / 29,029ft). For thirty years, the "Third Pole" had defeated the world's best climbers and claimed at least 13 lives (including the mysterious disappearance of Mallory and Irvine). The success of the 1953 British Expedition was not just a triumph of individual courage, but of military-style logistics, teamwork, and the then-controversial use of supplemental oxygen systems.

## The Expedition: A Military Siege

Led by **Colonel John Hunt**, the expedition was organized like a D-Day invasion.
*   **Scale:** 350 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and tons of supplies carried from Kathmandu (a 170-mile trek).
*   **Strategy:** "Siege tactics." Slowly building a chain of camps (Camp I to Camp IX) up the mountain to ferry supplies for the final pair.
*   **Oxygen:** They used "Open-circuit" oxygen sets. They were heavy, unreliable, and prone to freezing, but essential for the "Death Zone" (above 8,000m).

## The Assault Pairs

Hunt selected two pairs of climbers for the summit push.

### The First Attempt (May 26)
**Tom Bourdillon & Charles Evans.**
They used experimental "Closed-circuit" oxygen (re-breathers).
They reached the South Summit (8,750m)—higher than any human had ever been.
But their oxygen valves froze. They were only **100 meters** (vertical) from the top, but they had to turn back or die.
They returned exhausted, collapsing into the arms of Hillary and Tenzing.

### The Second Attempt (May 28-29)
**Edmund Hillary & Tenzing Norgay.**
They moved up to Camp IX (Ridge Camp) at 27,900 ft.
**The Night:** They spent the night on a tiny sloping ledge, battered by gale-force winds. They drank gallons of lemonade to stay hydrated.
Hillary noticed his boots had frozen solid. He spent 2 hours the next morning thawing them over a Primus stove.

### The Hillary Step
On the final ridge, they encountered a formidable obstacle: a 40-foot vertical rock face.
Hillary saw a crack between the rock and the ice cornice overhanging the 10,000-foot drop.
He jammed his back against the rock and his feet against the ice, wriggling up backward. Tenzing followed.
This feature is now known as the **Hillary Step** (which reportedly collapsed in the 2015 earthquake).

## The Summit (11:30 AM)

They crested the final snow dome.
Hillary reached out to shake Tenzing's hand; Tenzing hugged him instead.
They spent **15 minutes** on top.
**The Photos:**
Hillary took the famous photo of Tenzing holding his ice axe with flags (UN, UK, Nepal, India).
There is *no photo of Hillary*. Hillary said Tenzing didn't know how to use the camera, and "the summit of Everest is no place to teach a man photography."
**The Offerings:**
Tenzing buried some chocolates and biscuits as an offering to the mountain goddess (*Miyolangsangma*). Hillary buried a small crucifix given to him by John Hunt.

## "We knocked the bastard off"12

They descended to the South Col.
Fellow climber George Lowe walked out to meet them.
Hillary, removing his mask, grinned and said the most famous line in mountaineering history:
**"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off."**

---

## The News

The news reached London on the morning of June 2, 1953—the exact day of **Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation**.
The press hailed it as a "Coronation Gift" and a sign of a new Elizabethan Age.
Hillary and Hunt were knighted immediately. Tenzing received the George Medal (political complications prevented full knighthood, but he was celebrated as a hero in Asia).

---

## Legacy

Hillary never felt entirely comfortable with the fame. He devoted the rest of his life to the **Himalayan Trust**, building schools, hospitals, and airfields for the Sherpa people of the Khumbu valley.
When asked about his profession, he always wrote "Beekeeper."
