## Summary

Robert Gabriel Mugabe (February 21, 1924 – September 6, 2019) led Zimbabwe for 37 years, first as Prime Minister (1980-1987) then as President (1987-2017). Initially celebrated as a hero of African liberation who peacefully transitioned white-ruled Rhodesia to black-majority rule, Mugabe transformed into an authoritarian dictator. His rule was marked by violent suppression of opposition, disastrous land seizures that destroyed agriculture, hyperinflation reaching absurd levels, political violence, and refusal to relinquish power despite economic collapse. A military coup finally forced him from office in 2017, ending one of Africa's longest-running dictatorships.
