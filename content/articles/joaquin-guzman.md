## Summary
Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera, known as 'El Chapo,' was the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in history. He was one of the world's most wanted fugitives. He escaped prison twice before final capture in 2016 and extradition to the United States.

## Early Life

He pioneered the use of tunnels under the US-Mexico border. He used extreme violence against rivals. Forbes listed him as one of the world's most powerful people. [^2]

He escaped again in 2015 through a mile-long tunnel from his cell. Recaptured in January 2016. Extradited to the US in 2017 and convicted on all counts in 2019, sentenced to life plus 30 years. [^3]
