## Summary

Camillo Golgi was an Italian physician and biologist who shared the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Santiago Ramón y Cajal for their work on the structure of the nervous system. He developed the Golgi staining technique, which allowed visualization of individual neurons for the first time. He also discovered the Golgi apparatus in cells. Ironically, he and Cajal disagreed on whether neurons were discrete cells or a continuous network.
