## Summary

Giovanni Battista Venturi discovered the Venturi effect in 1797 — the reduction in fluid pressure when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe. This principle is fundamental to fluid mechanics and is used in carburetors, aspirators, medical equipment, and flow measurement devices worldwide.
