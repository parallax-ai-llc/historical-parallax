## Summary

Cathleen Morawetz made breakthrough contributions to the mathematics of wave propagation and transonic fluid flow. Her work on partial differential equations for mixed-type flows was crucial to understanding shock waves in aerodynamics. She was the first woman to receive the National Medal of Science in mathematics and directed the Courant Institute.
