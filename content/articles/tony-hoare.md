## Summary

Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist known for developing Quicksort, one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, and Hoare logic for verifying program correctness. He also invented the concept of null references, which he later called his 'billion-dollar mistake.' His work on communicating sequential processes (CSP) influenced concurrent programming theory. He received the Turing Award in 1980.
