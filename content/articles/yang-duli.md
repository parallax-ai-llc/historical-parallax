## Summary

Yang Duli (楊肇嘉, 1958-2024) was a prominent Taiwanese political activist and independence movement leader who dedicated his life to Taiwan's democratization and sovereignty. Born during the authoritarian period of martial law, Yang emerged as a vocal advocate for human rights and political reform in the 1980s. He played a significant role in the dangwai (outside the party) movement that challenged the Kuomintang's (KMT) monopoly on power and later became a key figure in Taiwan's pro-independence movement. Yang's activism spanned over four decades, during which he endured imprisonment, surveillance, and political persecution, yet remained committed to the vision of a free and democratic Taiwan separate from Chinese control.

## Early Life and Background

Yang Duli was born on September 21, 1958, in Tainan, southern Taiwan, during a period when the island was under martial law imposed by the Kuomintang government following their retreat from mainland China in 1949[^1]. Growing up in a modest family with strong Taiwanese identity, Yang was exposed to the tensions between native Taiwanese and mainland Chinese who had arrived with the KMT government. His father worked as a small business owner, while his mother was a schoolteacher who instilled in him a love for Taiwanese language and culture[^2].

During his formative years, Yang witnessed the suppression of Taiwanese identity under the KMT's Sinicization policies, which banned the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in schools and promoted Mandarin Chinese as the sole official language[^3]. This experience of cultural erasure deeply affected young Yang and planted the seeds of his later political activism. He attended local public schools in Tainan, where he excelled academically despite the restrictive political environment.

In 1976, Yang enrolled at National Taiwan University (NTU) to study political science, one of the few universities where underground political discussions could take place among trusted student circles[^4]. At NTU, he encountered like-minded students who questioned the authoritarian KMT rule and began reading banned literature about Taiwan's history and international political theory. The university became his political awakening, where he joined informal study groups that discussed democracy, self-determination, and human rights—concepts that were dangerous to express publicly during the White Terror period[^5].

## Rise to Power

Yang Duli's political awakening accelerated in 1979 when the Kaohsiung Incident occurred—a massive pro-democracy demonstration that was violently suppressed by the KMT government, resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of leading opposition figures[^6]. This event, considered a watershed moment in Taiwan's democratization movement, galvanized Yang and his generation of activists. Shortly after graduating from NTU in 1980, Yang joined the dangwai movement, working as an aide to several opposition politicians who operated outside the KMT's political monopoly[^7].

Throughout the 1980s, Yang worked tirelessly organizing grassroots campaigns, publishing underground newsletters, and coordinating with international human rights organizations to bring attention to Taiwan's political prisoners[^8]. His activities put him under constant surveillance by the Taiwan Garrison Command, the KMT's security apparatus responsible for suppressing dissent. In 1984, Yang was arrested for the first time on charges of "sedition" after helping to publish a magazine article criticizing President Chiang Ching-kuo's authoritarian rule[^9]. He spent eighteen months in prison, an experience that hardened his resolve rather than breaking his spirit.

Upon his release in 1986, Yang witnessed a critical turning point: the formation of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan's first opposition party, which was technically illegal but was tolerated as Chiang Ching-kuo began liberalizing Taiwan's political system in his final years[^10]. Yang became an early DPP member and quickly rose through the ranks due to his organizational skills and unwavering commitment to Taiwan independence. He was elected to the Tainan City Council in 1989, becoming one of the youngest DPP councilors at the time[^11].

In the 1990s, as Taiwan transitioned to democracy following the lifting of martial law in 1987 and the first direct presidential election in 1996, Yang positioned himself as a leader of the DPP's pro-independence faction[^12]. While some DPP members advocated for a more moderate approach to cross-strait relations, Yang consistently argued that Taiwan should formally declare independence from China and seek international recognition as a sovereign state. This stance made him both a hero to independence supporters and a controversial figure among those who feared provoking Beijing's ire.

## Major Achievements

Yang Duli's most significant achievement was his role in mainstreaming the discourse of Taiwan independence within democratic politics. In the early 1990s, openly advocating for independence was still considered radical and dangerous, as it could provoke military threats from China[^13]. Yang, however, used his position as a city councilor and later as a DPP legislator (elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1998) to consistently articulate the case for Taiwan's sovereignty[^14].

One of Yang's landmark legislative efforts was his sponsorship of the "Taiwan Normalization Act" in 2002, which proposed changing the Republic of China's official name to "Republic of Taiwan" and drafting a new constitution that would reflect Taiwan's status as an independent nation[^15]. While the bill did not pass due to opposition from both the KMT and moderate DPP members, it sparked a national debate about Taiwan's identity and future that continues to this day. The proposal elevated Yang's profile as a principled advocate willing to take political risks for his beliefs[^16].

Yang was also instrumental in advocating for transitional justice in Taiwan. He worked extensively on legislation to compensate victims of the White Terror period and their families, and he pushed for the establishment of the Transitional Justice Commission in 2018[^17]. His personal experience as a political prisoner gave him moral authority on these issues, and he often testified before legislative committees about the importance of acknowledging historical injustices committed by the authoritarian KMT government[^18].

On the international front, Yang traveled extensively throughout the 2000s and 2010s to build support for Taiwan among foreign governments and civil society organizations[^19]. He established relationships with lawmakers in the United States, Japan, and European countries, arguing that supporting Taiwan's democracy was in the free world's strategic interest. His advocacy contributed to increased international sympathy for Taiwan's precarious position, particularly among human rights organizations[^20].

Yang was a prolific writer and public intellectual, authoring five books on Taiwan's history, identity, and political future[^21]. His most influential work, "The Taiwan Question: A Moral Imperative" (2008), argued that Taiwan's right to self-determination was not merely a political preference but a fundamental human right that the international community had a moral obligation to support[^22]. The book was translated into English, Japanese, and several European languages, bringing Taiwan's perspective to global audiences.

In his later years, Yang became a mentor to younger activists and politicians in the DPP and other pro-independence groups. He established the "Taiwan Future Foundation" in 2015, a think tank dedicated to researching policy options for Taiwan's sovereignty and conducting public education campaigns about Taiwan's distinct identity[^23]. The foundation has trained hundreds of young activists and produced influential policy papers on constitutional reform, diplomatic strategy, and cross-strait relations.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his contributions to Taiwan's democracy, Yang Duli was a polarizing figure who attracted significant criticism from multiple quarters. His uncompromising stance on Taiwan independence was viewed by critics as unnecessarily provocative and potentially dangerous to Taiwan's security[^24]. Moderate politicians, including some within his own DPP, argued that Yang's rhetoric risked triggering a military conflict with China that Taiwan could not win without massive American intervention—intervention that was far from guaranteed[^25].

Business leaders and economic policy experts frequently criticized Yang for prioritizing ideological purity over economic pragmatism[^26]. They pointed out that Taiwan's economy was deeply integrated with mainland China, and that Yang's independence advocacy could result in economic sanctions or trade disruptions that would harm ordinary Taiwanese workers and businesses. Yang was accused of being out of touch with the economic realities facing Taiwan and of promoting a romantic nationalism that ignored practical constraints[^27].

Yang's relationship with indigenous Taiwanese groups was also complicated and sometimes contentious. While he claimed to fight for all Taiwanese people, indigenous activists criticized him for promoting a Han-centric version of Taiwanese identity that marginalized the island's original inhabitants[^28]. They argued that Yang's independence movement focused on Han Taiwanese ethnic consciousness and failed to adequately address indigenous sovereignty claims or the colonial history that affected indigenous peoples under both Chinese and Japanese rule[^29].

Within the DPP, Yang was sometimes viewed as a factional troublemaker who prioritized ideological battles over party unity and electoral success[^30]. During periods when the DPP adopted more moderate positions on cross-strait relations to appeal to centrist voters, Yang publicly criticized party leadership and threatened to form splinter groups. His critics within the party accused him of being more interested in personal prominence than in building a broad coalition capable of governing effectively[^31].

Yang's confrontational political style also earned him enemies. He was known for fiery speeches that sometimes employed inflammatory rhetoric against political opponents, particularly KMT politicians whom he accused of being "Chinese collaborators" or "traitors to Taiwan"[^32]. This language, while popular among his base, alienated potential allies and contributed to the toxic polarization of Taiwan's political discourse. Critics argued that Yang's divisive approach undermined the democratic norms he claimed to champion[^33].

His foreign advocacy efforts were also controversial. The KMT and unification supporters accused Yang of being a separatist who damaged Taiwan's international relationships and played into American hands by encouraging Taiwan to serve as a pawn in U.S.-China rivalry[^34]. They argued that his lobbying activities in Washington and other foreign capitals violated the principle that Taiwan's future should be decided by Taiwanese people themselves, not influenced by external powers with their own strategic interests[^35].

---

## Personal Life

Yang Duli married Lin Mei-hui, a fellow political activist he met during the dangwai movement, in 1985[^36]. Lin was herself a prominent women's rights advocate who had participated in Taiwan's feminist movement during the 1980s. The couple had two children: a daughter, Yang Hsiao-wen, born in 1987, who became a human rights lawyer, and a son, Yang Wei-chen, born in 1991, who pursued a career in technology and largely stayed out of politics[^37].

Family life was often strained by Yang's political activism and the risks it entailed. Lin later recalled in interviews that during the martial law period, she lived in constant fear that her husband would be arrested again or worse[^38]. The family experienced surveillance, intimidation, and social ostracism due to Yang's political activities. Despite these pressures, Lin remained a steadfast supporter of her husband's work and was active in her own right in the democracy movement.

Yang was described by friends and colleagues as intense and driven, with little patience for small talk or political calculation[^39]. He was a voracious reader with a particular interest in political philosophy and the history of independence movements around the world, often drawing parallels between Taiwan's situation and other nations that had achieved independence from larger powers[^40]. He maintained a personal library of over 10,000 books in his Tainan home.

Despite his serious political persona, Yang had a lighter side. He was an amateur photographer who enjoyed capturing landscapes of Taiwan's mountains and coastlines, seeing this as a way of documenting the beauty of the land he fought to protect[^41]. He was also a devoted baseball fan who rarely missed watching Taiwan's national team play, considering baseball an important part of Taiwanese culture distinct from mainland China.

In his later years, Yang faced health challenges, including diabetes and heart disease, conditions he attributed partially to the stress of decades of political struggle and his time in prison[^42]. He continued working despite these ailments, driven by a sense that his life's mission remained incomplete. Friends noted that he became somewhat mellower in his sixties, more willing to mentor young people than to engage in direct political combat, though he never abandoned his core beliefs[^43].

Yang passed away on August 19, 2024, at the age of 65, from complications related to heart disease[^44]. His death prompted an outpouring of tributes from across Taiwan's political spectrum, with even some political opponents acknowledging his sincerity and dedication to his principles. President Lai Ching-te attended his funeral and praised Yang as a "guardian of Taiwan's democracy" whose sacrifices would not be forgotten[^45].

## Legacy

Yang Duli's legacy is complex and continues to be debated within Taiwan and in discussions about the island's future. For supporters of Taiwan independence, Yang is remembered as a courageous pioneer who refused to compromise on Taiwan's sovereignty even when it was politically expedient to do so[^46]. They credit him with helping to transform independence from a fringe position to a mainstream viewpoint now held by a majority of Taiwanese people, particularly younger generations who identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese[^47].

His legislative work on transitional justice has had lasting impact. The mechanisms he helped establish for investigating and compensating victims of authoritarian-era abuses have processed thousands of cases and contributed to Taiwan's reckoning with its authoritarian past[^48]. This work is considered essential to consolidating Taiwan's democratic identity and distinguishing it from the authoritarian system in mainland China.

The Taiwan Future Foundation that Yang established continues to be an influential think tank shaping policy debates on sovereignty and national identity[^49]. It has become a training ground for young DPP politicians and independence activists, ensuring that Yang's ideological legacy will influence Taiwan's politics for years to come. The foundation's research on constitutional reform and sovereignty options is frequently cited in academic and policy discussions.

Yang's international advocacy helped establish networks of support for Taiwan among foreign policymakers and civil society organizations[^50]. His framing of Taiwan's situation as a human rights and democracy issue rather than merely a geopolitical dispute has been adopted by many international Taiwan supporters. This legacy is particularly visible in the Taiwan Caucuses that exist in several democratic countries' legislatures, which Yang helped to establish or strengthen[^51].

However, Yang's legacy also includes the criticism that his uncompromising approach may have made Taiwan's diplomatic situation more difficult. By insisting on formal independence rather than accepting the status quo of de facto independence, critics argue that Yang contributed to cross-strait tensions that have limited Taiwan's international space and increased the risk of conflict[^52]. This debate over pragmatism versus principle continues to define Taiwan's political discourse.

Within Taiwan's domestic politics, Yang's confrontational style and divisive rhetoric are seen by some as contributing to political polarization that has made governance more difficult[^53]. The deep blue-green divide in Taiwan, which Yang's career exemplified, has sometimes prevented cooperation on important policy issues and created a political culture of animosity rather than deliberation.

Culturally, Yang is remembered as an exemplar of Taiwanese resistance and resilience. His life story—from growing up under martial law to becoming a leading voice for democracy and independence—embodies Taiwan's journey from authoritarianism to democracy[^54]. His personal sacrifices, including imprisonment and constant political pressure, have made him a symbolic figure representing commitment to principle over personal comfort.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars of Taiwan's democratization generally regard Yang Duli as an important figure in the island's political transformation. Dr. Shelley Rigger, a prominent Taiwan studies expert, has written that Yang represented the "moral conscience" of the independence movement, refusing to compromise on fundamental principles even when moderation might have been politically advantageous[^55]. Rigger and others argue that movements need both moderates and radicals, and that Yang's uncompromising stance helped expand the Overton window, making more moderate pro-independence positions seem reasonable by comparison[^56].

Taiwanese historians have praised Yang's role in preserving memory of the White Terror period and advocating for transitional justice. Dr. Chen Yi-shen, a historian specializing in this era, credits Yang with keeping the experiences of political prisoners in public consciousness and pushing for institutional mechanisms to address historical injustices[^57]. Chen argues that without activists like Yang, Taiwan might have experienced the kind of historical amnesia that allows authoritarian tendencies to resurface.

Political scientists who study independence movements internationally have noted parallels between Yang's activism and successful sovereignty campaigns in other contexts. Dr. Michael Hechter, a scholar of nationalism and secession, has compared Yang favorably to leaders of Baltic independence movements in the late Soviet period, noting that both demonstrated how persistent advocacy can shift public opinion over generational timeframes[^58].

Human rights organizations have consistently recognized Yang's contributions to democracy and freedom of expression. Amnesty International listed Yang as a prisoner of conscience during his 1984-1986 imprisonment and continued to cite his case as an example of the KMT's political repression[^59]. After his release, Yang maintained relationships with international human rights groups and was frequently invited to speak about Taiwan's democratic transition as a model for other societies.

Younger activists in Taiwan, particularly those involved in the Sunflower Movement of 2014 and subsequent social movements, often cite Yang as an inspiration[^60]. They credit him with demonstrating that principled resistance is possible even under authoritarian conditions and that individual activists can make a difference in shaping political outcomes. Several prominent young DPP politicians have acknowledged Yang's mentorship and influence on their political development[^61].

### Negative Views

Critics of Yang Duli, particularly those who support closer ties with mainland China or the status quo in cross-strait relations, view him as a dangerous provocateur who unnecessarily increased the risk of war. Dr. Ku Chung-hua, a political scientist at National Chengchi University, has argued that Yang's advocacy for formal independence declaration ignored the military and economic realities of Taiwan's situation and could have led to catastrophic consequences for Taiwan's security[^62].

Some scholars have criticized Yang's nationalism as exclusionary and ethnically based. Dr. Wu Rwei-ren, a sociologist studying Taiwan's national identity, has argued that Yang's version of Taiwan independence was rooted in Hoklo ethnic consciousness and failed to articulate an inclusive civic nationalism that could genuinely embrace all of Taiwan's diverse populations[^63]. Wu points to Yang's troubled relationship with indigenous groups and his relatively limited engagement with Taiwan's new immigrant communities as evidence of this limitation.

Economic analysts have been particularly critical of Yang's positions on cross-strait relations. Dr. Huang Kwei-bo, an international relations scholar, has argued that Yang's ideology-driven approach ignored the economic interdependence between Taiwan and China that has been crucial to Taiwan's prosperity[^64]. Huang contends that Yang's advocacy could have resulted in economic isolation that would have harmed ordinary Taiwanese workers and businesses.

Within academic discussions of Taiwan's democracy, some scholars have questioned whether Yang's confrontational approach was ultimately productive. Dr. Yun-han Chu, a political scientist, has suggested that Yang's divisive rhetoric may have deepened Taiwan's political polarization and made consensus-building more difficult[^65]. Chu argues that democratic consolidation requires not just opposition to authoritarianism but also cultivation of democratic norms like compromise and tolerance, which Yang's style sometimes undermined.

Chinese scholars and officials have uniformly condemned Yang as a separatist and troublemaker. Official Chinese media characterized him as a "splittist" who served foreign interests, particularly the United States, in attempting to divide China[^66]. Chinese academics have argued that Yang's activism represented a dangerous form of ethnic nationalism that threatened regional stability and violated China's sovereignty[^67].

Some critics within Taiwan's pro-independence movement itself have questioned Yang's strategic judgment. They argue that his insistence on formal independence declaration, rather than working to strengthen Taiwan's de facto independence and international participation under its current ambiguous status, was counterproductive[^68]. These critics contend that Yang's maximalist position made it harder to build the broad coalition necessary to advance Taiwan's interests in practical ways.
