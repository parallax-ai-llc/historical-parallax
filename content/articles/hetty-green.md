## Summary

Hetty Green was known as the 'Witch of Wall Street' and was the richest woman in America during the Gilded Age. She was a shrewd investor in real estate, railroads, and government bonds. Her extreme frugality became legendary — she reportedly wore the same black dress and refused medical treatment for her son's injured leg. She managed her investments during a time when women had virtually no role in finance.
